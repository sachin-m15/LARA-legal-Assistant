1.1 Since common questions of law and facts arise in these civil appeals and writ petitions, they have
been heard together and are being disposed of by this common judgment.
1.2 The Civil Appeals arise from the judgments of the High Courts of Allahabad, Delhi, Gauhati,
Gujarat, Jharkhand, Kerala, Madras, Orissa, Punjab & Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand while
two writ petitions have been filed before this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution by M/s Tata
Play & Another and M/s Tata Play Ltd.
Bird’s Eye View of the Controversy:
2. The assessees have filed these appeals assailing the provisions of the respective State Acts under
which tax on entertainment has charged on them on the premise that their activity is relatable to the
field of entertainment as envisaged under Entry 62 – List II of the Seventh Schedule to the
Constitution. It is their contention that they are not liable to pay entertainment tax (or luxury tax)
under the respective provisions of the State enactments. It is further case of the assessee that they
are engaged in broadcasting of signals etc. through television channels to the subscribers of those
channels hence, possibly they are liable to pay service tax to the Central Government under Entry 97
– List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. There are however two writ petitions filed by
certain assessees who have also ventilated their grievance that they are not liable to pay service tax
as well. The question whether the appellants-assessees are liable to pay entertainment tax under the
provisions of the respective State enactments which are relatable to Entry 62 – List II of the Seventh
Schedule of the Constitution and are also liable to pay service tax under the provisions of the
Finance Act, 1994 as amended from time to time as a provider of a taxable service namely
broadcasting service within the scope and ambit of Entry 97 – List I which is a residuary entry for
the relevant purpose of assessment is the moot question which arises in these appeals.
2.1 The State of Kerala being aggrieved by the striking down of the sub-section (iv) of proviso to
Section 4 under which the cable operators who have less than 7,500 connections are being exempt
from payment of entertainment tax and whereas those who have over and above 7,500 connections
are liable to pay the same tax being discriminatory in nature and being strike down by the Kerala

High Court is questioned by the State of Kerala in its appeal. While considering the controversy
between the parties, the doctrine of pith and substance in interpreting the entries of the Seventh
Schedule of the Constitution as well as the aspect theory as referred to by the learned senior counsel
and learned counsel who have appeared for the respective parties shall be dealt with. 2.2 Since the
fields of legislation are in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India and would be referred to
during the course of discussion primarily in List I and List II (Union List and State List respectively)
in these cases, it shall be understood that any reference to these Lists is only with reference to the
Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India.

Tax, 1979 levying entertainment tax on DTH services was fully within the legislative
competence of the State and did not encroach upon the field which the Parliament
exclusively has authority to legislate.
Relying on the judgment of this Court in State of West Bengal vs. Purvi Communication Pvt. Ltd.,
(2005) 3 SCC 711 (“Purvi Communication”), it was observed that the activity carried on by
petitioners therein was not different from that carried out by cable operators in Purvi
Communication. To explain the distinctions between the imposition of service tax and
entertainments tax the High Court noted that the ‘incidence’ of service tax is on the license
agreement obtained from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting whereas the ‘incidence’ for
the levy of entertainment tax is based on the individual contracts executed by the petitioner with its
customers.
3.3.2 Similarly, the High Court of Punjab and Haryana High Court in the impugned judgment dated
25.10.2010 held that the levy of entertainment duty falls under Entry 62 - List II which operates in a
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
14
completely different field from Entry 92C - List I. Affirming the application of aspect theory to the
present facts, it was observed that levies of service tax and entertainment tax can co-exist and can be
harmonized as they concern different aspects. Therefore, the High Court upheld the vires of the
Punjab Entertainment Duty Act, 1955, as amended in 2010, which levied entertainment duty on
DTH services and dismissed the petition. 3.3.3 The impugned judgment dated 05.09.2011 of the
Delhi High Court passed in Bharti Telemedia Ltd. vs. Government of NCT of Delhi, W.P.(C) No.
4935/2011 applied aspects theory to the facts in hand and held that the State legislature is
competent to levy an entertainment tax on all payments for admission through DTH. It was
observed that the transaction in question has an aspect of service which is amenable to service tax
and an aspect of entertainment which is amenable to entertainment tax. The writ petitions were
dismissed and challenge to Section 7 of the Delhi Entertainments and Betting Tax Act, 1996 was
rejected. 3.3.4 Subsequently, Gauhati High Court at Guwahati vide impugned judgment dated
22.02.2012 dismissed the petitions challenging the relevant provisions of Assam Amusement and
Betting Tax Act, 1939 in terms of the judgments of the Uttarakhand High Court dated 26.07.2010
and Punjab and Haryana High Court dated 25.10.2010. The Gauhati High Court was of the view that
the issues raised were already covered by the aforesaid judgments. 3.3.5 By way of impugned order
dated 24.04.2012, the High Court of Orissa at Cuttack dismissed the writ petition being M/s. Tata
Sky Ltd. vs. State of Orissa, Writ Petition (C) No. 8966 of 2011, and held that the aforesaid decision
of the Punjab and Haryana High Court dated 25.10.2010 was squarely applicable to the facts before
it.
3.3.6 The High Court of Judicature at Allahabad also dismissed the writ petition preferred before it
vide impugned judgment dated 20.07.2012. The High Court thought it fit to respect the broad
latitude given to legislature in fiscal legislation and thereby rejected the argument that the rate of
entertainment was discriminatory in comparison with cable operators. It also agreed with the
findings of the Delhi High Court on the application of aspect theory. In the present batch of
petitions, subsequent orders of the Allahabad High Court dated 09.04.2018, 11.04.2019 and
19.04.2018 are also challenged. These orders which were passed in terms of the impugned judgment
dated 20.07.2012 are also challenged. 3.3.7 On 19.10.2012, the High Court of Judicature at Madras
vide its order and judgment impugned herein held, in principle, that there could be a levy of
entertainment tax on entertainment received through DTH services and the pith and substance of
the levy contemplated under Entry 62 - List II is a levy on ‘entertainment’ in contradistinction to
service tax levy on providing of service. The High Court also rejected the argument that Entry 62 -
List II only refers to public entertainment and not entertainment through DTH vis-à-vis public
entertainment. However, in the specific facts and circumstances, the High Court also held that the
impugned charging provision i.e. Section 4-I of the Tamil Nadu Entertainments Tax Act, 1939 is
inadequate due to no explicitly mention of the chargeable event and incidence of tax. Therefore, the
writ petitions challenging the levy of entertainment tax were allowed. In so far as the matters arising
from Madras High Court are concerned, the questions with regard to legislative competence under
Entry 62 – List I and whether DTH services were exclusively within Entry 92C/97 – List I are
considered in these appeals. Further, the correctness of the findings of the High Court with regard to
the charging section being defective is assailed by the State of Tamil Nadu in separate appeals which
are not part of this batch of appeals.

3.3.8 The High Court of Jharkhand at Ranchi vide impugned judgment dated 30.01.2014 held that
the Jharkhand Entertainment Tax Act, 2012 levying tax on “entertainment” through DTH, in pith
and substance, is on entertainment which falls under Entry 62 - List II. According to the High Court,
the aforesaid levy is distinguished from tax on “broadcasting service” under Entry 62 - List II.
Having found the State Legislature competent to levy such “entertainment tax” the High Court
dismissed all the writ petitions.
3.3.9 Impugned order dated 19.08.2014 passed by Rajasthan High Court conducted a survey of the
extant judgments of different High Courts on the issues raised and of Purvi Communication. Finally,
the High Court dismissed all three writ petitions by way of the impugned order.
3.3.10 Soon thereafter, the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad by way of impugned judgment
dismissed the challenge to the Gujarat Entertainment Tax (Exhibition by means of DTH
Broadcasting) Rules, 2010 for similar reasons as other High Courts. The Gujarat High Court relied
on Aspect Theory to dissect the two taxable events herein, firstly, the service of enabling flow of
content and secondly, entertainment from content. 3.3.11 Finally, vide Impugned judgment dated
28.06.2012, the Kerala High Court allowed WP(C) No.33966 of 2006 (R) on the ground that the
provisions of the impugned Act were discriminatory inasmuch as they authorized levy and collection
of luxury tax on cable TV operators including petitioners only with connections of 7500 or above as
discriminatory. According to the High Court, there could be no reasonable classification between
cable TV operators with connections below 7500 and cable TV operators with connections above
7500 with reference to object of legislation.
Writ Petitions filed before this Court:
W.P. (C) No.699/2014:
3.4 W.P. (C) No.699/2014 has been preferred by the petitioner Tata Sky Ltd. (now
Tata Play Ltd.) challenging the constitutional validity of Section 65 (105) (zk) read
with Section 65(15) of the Finance Act, 1994, which impose service tax on the
provision of “Direct to Home” (“DTH”) broadcast facility provided by the petitioner
to its subscribers. In short, the petitioner’s case is that the entire operation carried on
by the petitioner is one single operation and since only service tax is being imposed
on this activity, the petitioner has been paying service tax on this activity since the
year 2006. However, later the Jharkhand Entertainment Tax Act, 2012 (Act. No.13 of
2012) came into force taxing, inter alia, the activity of the petitioners as an
entertainment. As a challenge to the legality of this imposition has been rejected by
the High Court of Jharkhand at Ranchi and several other High Courts, which is now
before this Court, this writ petition has been preferred contending that once an
activity is found to be subject of an enactment under Entry 62 – List II, the same
cannot also be subject to service tax, which is imposed taking strength from Entry 97
– List I. Therefore, it is prayed that this Court may declare unconstitutional the
imposition of service tax on the petitioner’s activity. In the alternative, it is prayed
that this Court may declare that the activity of broadcasting does not constitute

providing entertainment and is thereby amenable to service tax. The prayers sought
for in this writ petition read as under:
“a) Declare that Section 65 (105) (zk) and Section 65(15) of the Finance Act, 1994,
insofar as they purport to impose a tax on the "Direct to Home" activity provided by
the Petitioner, are lacking in legislative competence and are thereby unconstitutional;
b) Issue a writ of mandamus and/or such other appropriate writ, order or directing
Respondent No.1, the Union of India, to pay to the various States, which seek to
collect tax by way of entertainment tax, the amount collected by them towards service
tax in discharge of the Petitioner's liability towards entertainment tax;
c) In the alternative, declare that the activity of broadcasting does not constitute
providing entertainment and is thereby amenable to service tax, and a tax by the
States on such activity under Entry 62, List II, Sch. 7 of the Constitution of India is
lacking in legislative competence;
d) If prayer (c) above is allowed, then issue a writ of mandamus and/or such other
appropriate writ, order or directing the Respondent States which collect tax by way of
entertainment tax, to pay over the tax collected by them towards entertainment tax
on the service provided by the Petitioner to the Union of India in discharge of the
Petitioner's liability towards service tax.
e) Pass such other orders as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the
interest of justice.” W.P. (C) No.748/2015:
3.5 The issues raised in W.P.(C) No.748/2015 are similar to W.P.(C) No.699/2014
inasmuch as the petitioner, M/s Tata Play Ltd., challenges the constitutional validity
of Section 65 (105) (zk) read with Section 65(15) of the Finance Act, 1994, which
imposes service tax on the provision of DTH broadcast facility provided by the
petitioner to its subscribers. Petitioner also challenges the constitutional validity of
Sections 3(10), 3(11) and Section 15A of the Andhra Pradesh Entertainment Tax Act,
1939, and the Assessment Order RC No.A2/424/2014-15 (ET) dated 27.08.2015
issued by the Government of Telangana, Commercial Taxes Department for FY
2011-22, 2012-13 and 2013-14. After re-
organization, the State of Telangana adopted the aforementioned Act. The petitioner’s principal
contention is that the petitioner cannot be burdened with imposition of ‘service tax’ and
‘entertainment tax’ on the same taxable event i.e. ‘transmission of signals’. It is also contended that
the petitioner as a DTH operator does not fall within the ambit of a ‘Master Cable Operator’ within
the meaning of the state enactment and therefore no entertainment tax can be levied on the
petitioner’s activity. Furthermore, it is argued that the State of Telangana cannot seek to levy
Entertainment Tax for the period prior to the existence of the State of Telangana especially for the
areas which now form part of the Andhra Pradesh. The prayers sought for in this writ petition read

4. We have heard learned senior counsel and learned counsel appearing for the respective
assessees/appellants herein and learned senior counsel and learned counsel for the respective State
as well as learned senior counsel appearing for the Union of India at length and on several dates.
Submissions on behalf of Appellants:
4.1 Learned senior advocate, Sri Datar, appearing on behalf of the appellant in C.A.
No. 2147/2012, drew our attention to the conscious use of the word ‘entertainments’
in Entry 62 - List II. It was contended that the word ‘entertainments’ is not the plural
of ‘entertainment’ but is nomen juris. This line of argument was advanced to contend
that the State cannot expand its taxing power by including DTH services within the
meaning of the word “entertainments”. To buttress his submission, he took us
through the consistent use of the word ‘entertainments’ from the year 1622 onwards
in British legislation. It was his argument that this consistent usage reflects the
continuing and underlying intention of constitutional makers for ‘entertainments’ to
mean only public entertainment to the exclusion of private entertainment. Reliance
in this regard was also placed on Cantonment Board Poona vs. Western India
Theatres Ltd., AIR 1954 BOM 261, wherein the Bombay High Court held that
‘entertainments’ is used as a common noun and is to mean ‘entertainments in public’.
4.2 Sri Datar also argued that Entry 31 – List I refers to ‘communication’ and
‘broadcasting’. Therefore, even in the absence of an express entry taxing
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
18
telecommunication or broadcasting, it was contended that these are “services” and
can be taxed only by the Union, even if used for television channels. As “broadcasting
service” includes DTH service, the States do not have the competence to tax the same
service. He also drew our attention to the omission of Section 129 of the Government
of India Act, 1935 that permitted imposing of fees on construction, use of
transmitters, and use of receiving apparatus. This was contended in light of the fact
that DTH operators use an apparatus to receive signals and further decode them.
4.3 It was further contended that vide Circular No. 61/10/2003-ST dated 14.07.2003,
the Ministry of Finance directed Doordarshan and All India Radio to pay service tax
as a provider of broadcasting services. It was therefore contended that, even if there
is any entertainment through Doordarshan and All India Radio, it has always been
treated as part of broadcasting service. By way of analogy, it was argued that Radio
Tax was also levied by the Post and Telegraph Department even though radio
provided entertainment. It was put forth that while Entry 31 - List I covers
broadcasting and “other like forms of communication”, Entry 13 - List II applies to
communications not specified in List I (which actually concerns surface transport).
4.4 Our attention was also drawn to Entry 92C – List I of the Constitution, which was
inserted but not notified. Relying on a judgment of the Constitution Bench of this
Court in State of Kerala vs. Mar Appraem Kuri Company Ltd., (2012) 7 SCC 106, Sri
Datar argued that the subject service tax is within the exclusive domain of Parliament
even though Entry 92C was not notified.
Therefore, it was contended that under Article 246(1) read with Article 248, only Parliament can
levy tax on any kind of services after the insertion of Entry 92C.
4.5 Furthermore, Sri Datar highlighted that, even the Negative List under Section 66D of the
Finance Act, 1994 in the service tax regime also specifically excludes tax on entertainments, which,
according to him, means only public entertainments. Therefore, it was contended that
entertainments in public places, theatres, etc. will be subject to State taxes; whereas the same
cinema shown on a personal device or on DTH/Cable TV can be taxed only by the Centre as being
part of broadcasting service. 4.6 It was also contended by Sri Datar that all the impugned
enactments passed by States have merely included “DTH Services” or broadcasting service as part of
the definition of entertainment and therefore the tax is levied on the service itself and not on the
entertainment, particularly because the entire value is taxed. 4.7 On the application of aspect theory,
learned senior counsel Sri Datar’s categorical argument was that “Double Aspect” theory only comes
into play when both the Union and States have legislative competence. However, as Parliament in
2001 declared its intent to tax DTH services, the aspect theory will have no application here.
4.8 Furthermore, on the relevancy of Purvi Communication to the matter at hand, it was pointed out
by Sri Datar that while Parliament levied a tax in the year 2001, the judgment in Purvi
Communication was pronounced in 2005 and has not noted the legislative history of entertainments
and also did not refer to any entries pertaining to broadcasting or communications. 4.9 As an
argument in the alternative, it was contended that even if the aspect theory was to apply, the
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
19
impugned enactments are liable to be struck down as they ignore that in all composite transaction
with different aspects, the legislature provides for bifurcation; however, herein the State legislatures
have not provided for computation of the value attributable to entertainment. Only the States of
Delhi and Assam have not levied entertainment tax on the gross consideration. It was contended
that taxation on gross value is prohibited in law and the value of entertainment cannot be included
in the value of service and vice- a-versa, vide Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited vs. Union of India,
(2006) 3 SCC 1 (“Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited”); K. Damodarasamy Naidu & Bros. vs. State of
Tamil Nadu, (2000) 1 SCC 521.
4.10 In that context, it was also argued that where the services are availed by the weaker section of
the society as well, an interpretation that avoids double taxation should be preferred. 4.11 Sri S.K.
Bagaria, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant in Civil Appeal No.1680 of
2020 and Writ Petition (Civil) No.699 of 2014, contended that the activity of the appellants herein is
primarily broadcasting and has been treated and taxed as such under the statutes enacted by the
Parliament. To show that the entire field of DTH services is occupied by the Central Government, Sri
Bagaria drew our attention to the order dated 15.03.2001 of the Ministry of Information and
Broadcasting, Government of India, by which DTH broadcasting was permitted in India.
4.12 According to Sri Bagaria, the fact that neither Entry 62 - List II nor any other entry in the State
List explicitly mentions taxes on broadcasting shows that any and all taxes on broadcasting can be
imposed exclusively by the Parliament. Reliance in that regard was placed on Article 248(2) of the
Constitution which provides for the Parliament to make any law imposing a tax not mentioned
either in the Concurrent list or in the State list. Reliance was placed on the dictum of this Court in
Association of Leasing & Financial Service Companies vs. Union of India, (2011) 2 SCC
352. 4.13 It was sought to be advanced that the question before this Court was not merely regarding
the scope of taxes on entertainments but also about the conspicuous absence of taxes on
broadcasting in Entry 62 - List II. In other words, the question is whether the expression ‘taxes on
entertainments’ can be construed so broadly as to include taxes on broadcasting within it. The
argument advanced was that even a reading of the entries in their widest amplitude would not
enable the respondents to read into the entry a subject not covered by it. Succinctly stated, the
argument of Sri Bagaria is that giving such a wide interpretation to Entry 62 - List II will nullify
Parliament's power and legislative competence to levy taxes on broadcasting service as there can be
no overlapping in the field of taxation.
4.14 While Entry 31 - List I is undisputedly acknowledged as a regulatory entry, it was also argued
that a construction as argued by the appellants will also be fully in line with the structure of the
constitutional scheme, especially that of the Seventh Schedule. As broadcasting and other like forms
of communication are covered by Entry 31 - List I and service tax on broadcasting is imposed under
Entry 97 - List I, it was argued that there is a discernible constitutional scheme which necessitates
the widest possible construction of Entry 31- List I. Additionally, it was advanced that the State List
has no mention of broadcasting and other like forms of communication or taxes on broadcasting
whereas State List does have regulatory entries in the form of Entry 33 – List II concerning sports,
entertainments and amusements, and in the form of Entry 34 – List II for betting and gambling.
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
20
Thus, Entry 62 – List II relates to taxes on luxuries, including taxes on entertainments,
amusements, betting and gambling.
4.15 Sri Bagaria, learned senior counsel, placed significant reliance on the scheme of regulation and
definition of broadcasting by Parliamentary statutes and orders. It was argued that the entire
contour of broadcasting is a subject matter of parliamentary enactments and, therefore, as all forms,
types and varieties of broadcasting are covered by Parliamentary Law, it is evident that every facet of
regulation of broadcasting is subsumed under Entry 31 – List I and the taxing power for
broadcasting is under Entry 97 – List I. Highlighting the importance of broadcasting, it was also
argued that broadcasting and other forms of communication are subjects of national importance
which were intended by the constitutional framers to be regulated and taxed by the Central
Government only. It is the case of the appellants that upholding such an interpretation of Entry 62 –
List II would be to truly and correctly reconcile the same with other entries in List I. According to
the appellants, the constitutional scheme is with respect to all forms, types and contents of
broadcasting. The consequences and effects of broadcasting are not the same thing as legislative
subject matter and, consequently, all forms and attributes of broadcasting also fall within List I. It is
Sri Bagaria’s argument that tax is sought to be levied merely with reference to the entertainment -
causing attribute of broadcasting and is, therefore, impermissible in law. 4.16 Reliance was placed
on the judgment of this Court in Special Reference No.1 of 2001, In Re: Association of Natural Gas
vs. Union of India, (2004) 4 SCC 489, wherein the validity of Gujarat Gas (Regulation of
Transmission, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2001 was challenged before the Constitution Bench.
The issue before the Court was whether the State had legislative competence to make laws on
natural gas and liquefied natural gas under Entry 25 – List II, “Gas and Gasworks” or whether the
Parliament was competent to make laws under Entry 53 – List I, “Regulation and development of
oilfields and mineral oil resources; petroleum and petroleum products; other liquids and substances
declared by Parliament by law to be dangerously inflammable”. While the State of Gujarat argued
that Entry 25 – List II must be given the widest possible interpretation and that it includes all types
of gases especially when there are no words of limitation in the entry itself, this Court considered the
consistent legislative practice in various legislations to hold that the term “petroleum” or “petroleum
products” has been given a wide meaning to include within itself natural gas and other similar
products. Sri Bagaria, learned senior counsel, contended that similarly, central legislations passed
by Parliament over several decades included within “broadcasting” any form of communication like
signals, images, sounds of all kinds by transmission of electromagnetic waves irrespective of the
contents and their natures or types. It was further contended that this reading will not make Entry
62 – List II a “useless lumber” because any or all forms of broadcasting was never intended to be
covered by the expression “entertainments”.
4.17 It was categorically argued that the aspect theory has no application to the activity at hand as
the activity of broadcasting is taxed by the Parliament and the state legislatures have no legislative
competence to tax the same under Entry 62 - List II as tax on ‘entertainments’. Sri Bagaria would
argue that even in Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Association of India vs. Union of India, (1989) 3
SCC 634 (“Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Association of India”) this Court rejected the challenge
to the central statute impugned therein as it found that the subject matter of the impugned statute
was in pith and substance a tax on expenditure and not on luxuries or sale of goods.

21
4.18 Sri Gulati, learned senior advocate, argued that at a foundational level, far from carrying out
any activity of entertainment, the appellant only acts as a conduit in the entire process of
transmission of signals to the subscriber of television channels. In this context, he outlined that
appellants perceive the nature of their activity as follows:
(i) entire activity of appellants is in relation to transmission of DTH signals; and
(ii) neither do appellants exercise any control over the content received from the
broadcaster nor do they control exhibition of the content.
4.19 It was contended that the said activity is aptly described as only rendering broadcasting service
which was earlier amenable to service tax under Section 65(105)(zk) of the Finance Act, 1994 and
was specifically expanded in 2005 to include DTH signals. That from the year 2007 onwards, the
appellant was discharging service tax on the entire monthly subscription charges under
‘broadcasting services’ without charging any additional consideration for set-top boxes and dish
antenna. It was argued that, in substance, this position continued even after the Negative List
regime was brought about in 2012.
4.20 Sri Gulati highlighted that States have enacted statutes under Entry 62 – List II intending to
tax the very same activity as that of providing “broadcasting service”, which is already amenable to
service tax imposed by the Parliament. According to Sri Gulati, the provisions of various State
enactments levying Entertainment tax can be categorized as follows:
i. Levy of tax is on admission to entertainment by way of a DTH connection;
ii. Levy is on entertainment through DTH service, and iii. No taxable event is
specified in the charging provision. 4.21 It was contented that herein there is only one
activity of providing DTH signal and that itself is a service. Reliance was placed on All
India Federation of Tax Practitioners vs. Union of India, (2007) 9 SCR 527 (“All India
Federation of Tax Practitioners”) to submit that a service is also an activity. Thus, it
was contended that the only taxable event here being providing the service of
broadcasting, there are no two aspects to the service provided by the Appellants and
only one taxable event i.e. provision of DTH service does not enable the States under
the guise of Entry 62 - List II to levy entertainment tax on the same aspect. 4.22 It
was stressed on behalf of the appellants that though entertainment may, inter alia, be
a consequence of DTH service, but entertainment tax cannot be levied on the activity
of provision of DTH service, vide Godfrey Phillips Ltd. vs. State of U.P., (2005) 2 SCC
515 (“Godfrey Phillips”). It was contended that there being only one taxable event,
there can be no confounding of the service provided herein as both: a service and an
entertainment.
4.23 In the same vein, reliance was placed on Godfrey Phillips to contend that the word
‘entertainments’ contemplates a tax on ‘activities’ of entertainments and not on any person being
entertained or receiving entertainment per se. As no entertainment is inherently embedded in the
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
22
activity conducted by appellants, namely, broadcasting service, there can be no levy of
entertainment tax on them.
4.24 It was also pressed that the position of law permits tax under Entry 62 - List II only on the act
of entertaining and not on the consequence of an activity being entertainment vide Western India
Theatres vs. Cantonment Board, Poona, 1959 Supp (2) SCR 63 (“Western India Theatres”).
Highlighting the multitude of content transmitted by appellants, it was advanced that the activity of
appellants cannot be seen as providing entertainment insofar as informational and educational
shows, news, etc. as these may not have any element of entertainment at all. 4.25 Another line of
argument of appellants advanced before us relates to a distinction between public entertainment
and private entertainment. By way of analogy to cinema theaters, it was contended that mere
provision of DTH services does not constitute a ticket “for admission to an entertainment”/or
provision of “entertainment”. It was also contended that for an entertainment to be taxed as such, it
should be open to public where members are invited. That is to say, Entry 62 – List II is restricted to
entertainments of a public color. – vide Geeta Enterprises vs. State of Uttar Pradesh, (1983) 4 SCC
202 (“Geeta Enterprises”). However, as DTH service is provided to a subscriber in a private place,
the appellants contended that the aspect of providing DTH service levy of entertainment tax is
constitutionally impermissible. According to Sri Gulati, learned senior counsel, the words appearing
alongside ‘entertainments’ in Entry 62 – List II must also be taken aid of to interpret the entry as
having a public colour. It was argued that the juxtaposition of amusements, betting and gambling
within one entry indicates that the tax contemplated is on establishments providing entertainment
activities. Similarly, it was highlighted that the taxable event in various state legislations is the
“admission for an entertainment” and not the consequence of entertainment.
4.26 The next line of contention taken by the appellants is that there is no overlap in taxing entries
and that it is settled law that taxing entries must be construed with clarity and precision as to
maintain exclusivity. - Commissioner of Central Excise and Customs, Kerala vs. Larsen and Toubro
Ltd., (2016) 1 SCC 170 and Hoechst Pharmaceuticals Ltd. vs. State of Bihar, (1983) 4 SCC 45
(“Hoechst Pharmaceuticals”).
4.27 On the question of applicability of aspect theory, which has been relied on by various High
Courts, the appellants contend that the activity of broadcasting is only one indivisible transaction
which cannot be artificially split into two taxable events and, therefore, the aspect theory would have
no applicability here as splitting is permitted only when the activity represents two distinct and
separate contracts which are discernible as such. - Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited.
4.28 In substance, the contention of the appellants was that the provision of providing DTH service
is only one taxable event which cannot be split into various aspects to become amenable to taxation
as both a broadcasting service and as entertainments. Reliance was also placed on the fact that the
appellants are mandated to avail license granted under Section 4 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885
for providing telecommunication services. It was also highlighted that this Court in Bharat Sanchar
Nigam Limited observed that the license under Section 4 of the Indian Telegraph Act is for
providing telecommunication service and not for supply of any goods or transfer of right to use any
goods. In furtherance of the same, it was noted by this Court that the integrity of the
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025

23
telecommunication service or license would therefore be mutilated if it were to be broken down into
pieces to be taxed as supply of goods or transfer of right to use goods. 4.29 Sri Gulati, learned senior
counsel, furthermore argued that there being no divisible event, the correct test to ascertain the true
nature of the activity herein is the dominant nature test. Having argued vehemently that the
dominant intention of the appellant is to act only as a conduit for receipt and transmission of
broadcasting signals, he highlighted that the aspect theory will be of no avail to the States to
entrench upon the Union List and tax services by including the cost of such service in the value of
the goods, vide Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited; Imagic Creative (P) Ltd. vs. CCT, (2008) 2 SCC 614
(“Imagic Creative”); Larsen and Toubro Limited vs. State of Karnataka, (2014) 1 SCC 708. 4.30 Sri
Gulati took us through the origin of the aspect theory in the Canadian jurisprudence whilst
highlighting at the outset a significant distinction between the Canadian and Indian jurisprudence
that must be borne in mind. In Lyle Francis Smith vs. Her Majesty the Queen, (1960) SCR 776, and
in several decisions since then, it has been observed by the Supreme Court of Canada that within the
Canadian constitutional scheme, an overlap is inevitable between the subjects outlining the areas of
legislations to be legislated on by the Parliament of Canada and provincial legislatures due to the
general wording of the subjects under Sections 91 and 92 of the British North America Act, 1867
respectively. However, it is settled law that in India, there is no overlap between the taxation entries
in List I and List II. It was highlighted that the double aspect doctrine has been developed to resolve
these situations of inevitable overlap and has been applied to allow both federal and provincial
regulation where powers overlap. It was contended that the doctrine has, however, never been
allowed to enable the dominion and provincial legislatures to separately tax two aspects of the same
transaction. It was therefore contented that any transplantation of the doctrine to the Indian
Constitution must be tempered and exercised with caution given that in the Indian constitutional
scheme, there cannot be any overlap in respect to the entries pertaining to taxation. 4.31
Furthermore, it was contended that the true nature of the activity of DTH services must be
ascertained while keeping in mind that the DTH operator has no control over the content that is
broadcast or received. It was contended that as the activity would continue to be a service even if no
entertainment value is transmitted, it must be held that the true nature of the activity is
predominantly that of a broadcasting service. It was repeatedly and vehemently argued on behalf of
appellants that any element of entertainment is purely incidental to the provision of service. 4.32 Sri
Gulati further argued that the pith and substance of the state legislations, impugned herein, is in the
nature of a broadcasting service. This argument links to the foundational argument that the activity
of providing broadcasting services is not in the nature of entertainment, and therefore, the levy
imposed on purported entertainment isn't different from service on which service tax is levied by the
central government. It was contended that states cannot simply deem the whole activity undertaken
by appellant as ‘entertainment’ which in fact is, fundamentally, a broadcasting service.
4.33 The argument further advanced on behalf of the appellants was that there is no machinery to
exclude the value of service from the value of entertainment. This was argued as the impugned
legislations, except those of the States of Delhi, Gujarat, and Assam, do not exclude the value of
service from the value of entertainment before levying entertainment tax. According to the
appellants, it is impermissible to levy entertainment tax on the value of the gross amount received
by the appellants from its subscribers without segregating the value of service from the value of
entertainment. In substance, the contention of the appellant was that in the absence of any
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
24
machinery to compute the measure of tax for the purpose of levy of entertainment tax, the charge of
entertainment tax itself would fall, vide Commissioner of Income Tax, Bangalore vs. B.C. Srinivasa
Setty, (1981) 2 SCC 460. 4.34 Notably, a three-judge bench of this Court in Purvi Communication
has already found that entertainment tax was leviable against cable operators. However, learned
senior counsel Sri K.K. Venugopal argued that the decision of this Court in Purvi Communication
failed to consider the tests laid down in Geeta Enterprises and to that extent is per incuriam and sub
silentio. Appellants also contended that the decision in Purvi Communication is distinguishable as
that case was not concerned with attempts of both Central Government and State Governments to
levy a tax on the same activity but instead dealt with the conflict between Entry 62 – List II and
Entry 31 – List I i.e. between a taxing entry and a regulatory entry, whereas the conflict herein is
between two taxing entries being Entry 97 – List I and Entry 62 – List II. 4.35 The appellants also
contended that if the State legislatures are held competent to levy entertainment tax under Entry 62
– List II, then the taxable event would fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the State legislature
and consequently the Central Government would lose competence to levy service tax under Entry 97
– List I. 4.36 Without prejudice to the foregoing arguments, learned senior counsel appearing for
the appellants argued that the impugned legislations promulgated by the states of Tamil Nadu,
Odisha, Assam and Gujarat fail to provide for a clear and unambiguous taxable event as they only
deem the operations of DTH operators as entertainment. Therefore, it was contended that these
legislations do not satisfy the test laid down by this Court in Govind Saran Ganga Saran vs. CST,
1985 Supp SCC 205 (“Govind Saran Ganga Saran”) and must be held to be unconstitutional. As only
the Madras High Court accepted this argument, learned counsel for the appellants contended that
the impugned judgments arising out of the High Courts including Orissa, Gauhati and Gujarat are
bad in law.
4.37 It was further contended that Section 3 of the Jharkhand Entertainment Tax Act, 2012, which
is the charging section, merely provides a tax on entertainment and lacks any clear and
unambiguous stipulation to tax entertainment through DTH. Therefore, in the absence of such
express words in the charging section, there cannot be any levy of entertainment tax. It was also
contended that the Notification dated 14.05.2012 issued by the State Government under Section 1(3)
of the Jharkhand Entertainment Tax Act, 2012 appointing 27.04.2012 as the date of implementation
of the Act suffers from the vice of imposing retrospective taxation in the absence of any express
legislative provision providing for it.
4.38 Ms. Shirin Khajuria, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the subscribers, took us
through the scheme of the impugned Act promulgated by the State of Kerala and brought to our
attention that there was a stay on the levy of luxury tax for the period 2006 to 2010 and therefore
the tax has to be collected only if leviable and not otherwise.

699/2014, commenced his arguments by noting that the writ petitioners have not pressed the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
25
prayers challenging the constitutional validity of Section 65 (105)(zk) and Section 65(15) of the
Finance Act, 1994. Further, arguing in support the constitutional validity of the entertainment tax
imposed under the State enactment, he contended that there is no conflict between Entry 62 – List
II and Entry 97 – List I. 5.1 According to learned senior counsel, this Court’s approach must be to
first interpret Entry 62 – List I, followed by an examination of the scope of Entry 33 – List I. It was
argued that the scope of Entry 62 – List II can be informed by the judgment of this Court in Western
India Theatres wherein it was held that a State imposition is on the activity of entertainment. In that
case, it was on the happening of a show in a theater. Reliance was placed on the following paragraph
from Western India Theatres:
“As pointed out by this Court in Navinchandra Mafatlal v. The Commissioner of
Income Tax, Bombay City (1), following certain earlier decisions referred to therein,
the entries in the legislative list should not be read in a narrow or restricted sense and
that each general word should be held to extend to all ancillary or subsidiary matters
which can fairly and reasonably be said to be comprehended in it. It has been
accepted as well settled that in construing such an entry conferring legislative powers
the widest possible construction according to their ordinary meaning must be put
upon the words used therein. In view of this well established rule of interpretation,
there can be no reason to construe the words " taxes on luxuries or entertainments or
amusements " in entry 50 as having a restricted meaning so -as to confine the
operation of the law to be made thereunder only to taxes on persons receiving the
luxuries, entertainments, or amusements. The entry contemplates luxuries,
entertainments, and amusements as objects on which the tax is to be imposed. If the
words are to be so regard- ed, as we think they must, there can be no reason to
differentiate between the giver and the receiver of the luxuries, entertainments, or
amusements and both may, with equal propriety, be made amenable to the tax. It is
true that economists regard an entertainment tax as a tax on expenditure and,
indeed, when the tax is imposed on the receiver of the entertainment, it does become
a tax on expenditure, but there is no warrant for holding that entry 50 contemplates
only a tax on moneys spent on luxuries, entertainments or amusements. The entry, as
we have said, contemplates a law with respect to these matters regarded as objects
and a law which imposes tax on the act of entertaining is within the entry whether it
falls on the giver or the receiver of that entertainment. ...” (emphasis supplied)
Applying the aforesaid to the facts of the instant cases, it was argued that irrespective
of the nomenclature of broadcasting or entertainment, the activity of the petitioner
ends with the TV set and is therefore carried out for the purpose of entertainment.
5.2 Sri Gupta further argued that where taxing entries are not in conflict, then there
is no need to go the doctrine of pith and substance. Furthermore, examining the
application of aspect theory in Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Association of India,
he argued that the same has been followed in All India Federation of Tax
Practitioners. It was also argued that Purvi Communication is not per incuriam and
was rightly decided it being distinguished from Geeta Enterprises for multiple
reasons.

State of Uttar Pradesh:
5.3 Learned senior counsel Sri Raizada appearing for the State of Uttar Pradesh,
contended that the judgment in Geeta Enterprises was adjudicated on the anvil of
interpretation of ‘places of entertainment’ as it appeared in the 1937 Act whereas the
present impugned levy is imposed under the revised 1979 Act. It was highlighted that
the period of the controversy herein is from 2005–2009 and any dictum under the
1937 Act would have no bearing on the present case. Furthermore, it was argued that
if for a single transaction two levies are made out or use a measure of another tax
then such an imposition would not be ultra vires the Constitution. Therefore, it was
contended that ‘entertainments’ as it appears in Entry 62 – List II must be given a
widest possible interpretation and it would be erroneous to define entertainment in a
myopic, rigid or straightjacket formula.
State of Odisha:
5.4 Sri Preetesh Kapur, learned senior advocate, appearing for the State of Odisha in
C.A. No.1536/2020 contended that Entry 62 – List II must be read in the widest
amplitude possible and a correct reading of the same allows imposition of tax on the
act of entertaining whether it falls on the provider or receiver of entertainment, vide
Western India Theatres. Furthermore, in Express Hotels (P) Ltd. vs. The State of
Gujarat, 1989 3 SCC 677 (“Express Hotels”), this Court, while interpreting Entry 62 –
List II on the context of luxuries, observed that a legislative entry takes within it
everything that can fairly and reasonably be said to be comprehended in it while the
actual measure of the levy is a matter of legislative policy and will be held to be good
in law as long as it has a reasonable nexus with the concept of luxuries. It was also
canvassed that the actual utilization or derivation of entertainment was irrelevant for
the imposition of tax and could be of any kind including one which may be purely
educative vide Express Hotels or Geeta Enterprises.
5.5 It was further argued that the Orissa Entertainment Tax Act, 2005 as well as the
Amendment Act of 2010 are, in pith and substance, relatable to Entry 62 - List II.
Applying the test expounded by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Purvi
Communication to ascertain whether a tax falls within the ambit of Entry 62 - List II,
learned senior counsel contended that the amendment in question, whereby
entertainment tax was imposed on DTH operators, is a tax on entertainment. 5.6 Sri
Kapur argued that this Court in para 46 of Purvi Communication has held that the
appropriate test is whether the activity being taxed has a direct and proximate nexus
with the provision (or enjoyment) of entertainment. It was also argued that once the
law is found to be in pith and substance relatable to Entry 62 - List II, the mere
imposition of service tax cannot by itself denude the State legislatures of their
legislative competence. 5.7 Sri Kapur sought to contend that when neither entry is
subject to the other, then both entries are required to be constructed so harmoniously
that they are given full effect in their respective fields. Therefore, both entries herein,
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
27
though they may seem overlapping, can indeed be given full effect as they deal with
distinct aspects. States have also placed significant reliance on ‘aspect theory’ or the
‘double aspect doctrine’ to establish that both Central and State Acts are valid as they
seek to levy tax on entirely different aspects even though they may form part of the
same activity.
5.8 According to Sri Kapur, had the liability been imposed directly upon the
subscriber, the distinction between service tax on the services rendered by the DTH
operator and entertainment tax upon the subscribers would have been self-evident. It
is settled law that entertainment tax, for administrative convenience, can either be on
the receiver or equally be upon the provider of the content without causing any
alteration to its nature. – Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Association of India. The
same case was also relied upon to contend that a measure of tax is not determinative
of the nature of the levy.
5.9 Furthermore, it was contended that the argument advanced by the appellants
herein would render Entry 62 – List II redundant as almost every provision of
entertainment would necessarily be borne out of rendition of some service. According
to Sri Kapur, this is precisely why the distinction between the two aspects must
always be kept in mind.
5.10 On the application of aspects theory, it was contented that the same is neither
contrary to the pith and substance doctrine nor is it an exception, but only
compliments the latter. The operationalization of aspect theory is explained by
suggesting that two competing enactments, if they deal with distinct aspects of a
transaction, will not restrict each other and will continue to apply in their respective
fields without inviting any question of overlap or repugnancy. It was submitted that
the aspect theory is helpful at the stage of a “seeming” conflict to determine whether
the aspects legislated upon are distinct and whether there is an overlap or not at all.
5.11 In response to the arguments of the appellants that Entry 31 read with Entry 97 –
List I must be seen as taking out from Entry 62 – List II a tax on entertainment
provided by means of broadcasting, the State of Orissa contended that such an
argument overlooks the distinct aspects involved in rendition of services and
entertainment. Neither could Entry 31 – List I being a regulatory entry whittle down
the scope of Entry 62 – List II nor could Entry 97 – List I being a residuary entry cull
out any aspect from a specific taxing entry in the State List.
5.12 Pertinently it was also highlighted that this Court in State of Karnataka vs. State
of Meghalaya, (2023) 4 SCC 416 (“State of Karnataka”), specifically rejected the
contention that a regulatory entry in the Union List must be construed as also
covering all facets of taxation along with and through the residuary entry, even if that
tax may squarely fall within the State List. 5.13 Furthermore, in response to the
contentions on Geeta Enterprises and Purvi Communication, it was contended that
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
28
the judgment in Geeta Enterprises categorically notes that this Court was concerned
with the definition of entertainment under a particular statute and not under Entry
62 – List II. That it would be wholly erroneous to transplant the limitations and
interpretations made in the context of a statute to be taken to govern the
interpretation of an entry in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, which must be
given an interpretation of the widest possible amplitude.
5.14 It was also highlighted that this Court in Suresh vs. State of T.N., (1997) 1 SCC
319 (“Suresh”) had already considered the argument and expressed agreement with
the view of the States herein.
5.15 Summarily, it was also argued that the imposition of tax on goods or an activity
that a person may ultimately enjoy or consume at home cannot be construed as an
invasion of the right to privacy. 5.16 To the argument of the appellants that they are
merely conduits in the chain between broadcasters and subscribers, it was responded
that it is settled law that a tax under Entry 62 – List II can be on the provider of
entertainment as well as or on the receiver. It was also contended that the DTH
operator evidently has a direct and proximate nexus with the subscriber inasmuch as
it is the DTH operator who enrolls and provides the setup box along with dish
antenna to the subscriber. Finally, it was contended that the argument of merely
being a conduit overlooks the well settled position that tax can be collected at any
convenient stage as long as a rational connection is maintained. – vide CCE vs.
Grasim Industries Ltd., (2018) 7 SCC 233.
5.17 It was also argued that the appellants have erred in relying on Bharat Sanchar
Nigam Limited to contend that the dominant intention of the activity must be seen
and that there must be splitting of charges between services and entertainment.
Learned senior counsel submitted that this argument ought to be rejected as it would
be totally erroneous to draw an analogy between entertainment tax on the one hand
and tax on sale of goods on the other, as in the case of entertainment the entire
service rendered by the provider is for the purpose of entertainment. Even though it
might be one activity, it is on one aspect, the price for services rendered and, from the
point of view of the subscribers, the price for entertainment. – Federation of Hotel &
Restaurant Association of India.
5.18 According to learned senior counsel, the Court in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited
held that tax on sale of goods cannot be levied on a separate and severable
component i.e. services as goods are only a component of the deemed severable
transaction by way of a fiction. In other words, in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, it
was held that the States lacked jurisdiction to tax the services component and
consequently, lacked the competency to include the price of services as a measure of
tax for sale of goods and vice-
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
29
versa. It was for this reason that the judgment in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited held that value of
services cannot be included in the value of goods. By way of analogy, it was contended that had it
been the case that electromagnetic waves had also been deemed to be goods and there was an
overlap of the entire consideration, only then would the judgment in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited
be similar to the facts herein.
5.19 It was also contended that the argument of splitting the consideration between services and
entertainment is an indirect manner of contending that the entire subscription amount cannot form
the measure of tax. It was argued that in case of a composite transaction including services and sale
of goods, a measure for one is distinct from the other by virtue of there being two deemed separate
transactions. However herein, as the employment of aspect theory as laid down in the Federation is
justified, the full subscription amount can indeed constitute the measure for both taxes as the
rational nexus between the levy and the measure is maintained. – vide Mineral Area Development
Authority vs. Steel Authority of India, 2024 SCC OnLine SC 1796. State of Tamil Nadu:
5.20 Sri Radhakrishnan, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of
Respondent-State of Tamil Nadu in C.A. No.1580/2020 and C.A. No.1581/2020,
invited this Court’s attention to the history of the legislation on the subject in the
State of Tamil Nadu.
Promulgated in 1939, the preamble to the Tamil Nadu Entertainments Tax Act, 1939 reflects that
the Act was intended “to impose a tax on amusement and other entertainments in the Province of
Madras.” Vide Act No.XVII of 1949 w.e.f. 1st August 1949, the words “a tax” was substituted by
“taxes” and by Madras Act No.V of 1958, the words “amusements and other entertainments” were
substituted by the word “entertainments”. 5.21 Thus, as it stands today, the Tamil Nadu
Entertainments Tax Act, 1939 is “an Act to impose taxes on entertainments in the State of Tamil
Nadu”. It was shown that Section 3(4) of the Act, which defines “entertainment” was amended to
levy tax on gross collection per show made by the theatres-touring, permanent and semi-permanent.
5.22 Of note is the charging section of the Act i.e., Section 4 which sought to tax entertainment
provided through cinematograph exhibition in the theatres on payment for admission. The system
of levy gradually underwent changes to pay a percentage on gross collection and based on theatre
location. Pertinently, it was submitted that in the wake of new age medium of recreation on
television screen through a VCR or cable television network, the legislature in its wisdom inserted
Section 4-D to the Act w.e.f. 17.05.1984. The aforesaid Section was substituted by Amendment Act
37 of 1994 with effect from 01.09.1994, which inserted a charging provision under Section 4-E to
levy tax on entertainment through cable television at 40% of contribution or subscription or
installation or connection charges or charges collected in any manner for television exhibition.
Similarly, appropriate changes were made to the definition of “entertainment” under Section 3(4) of
the Act to include cable TV and another source of entertainment. Thereafter, the State of Tamil
Nadu, having taken note of further technological advancement in offering entertainment through
DTH and through IPL matches, inserted section 4-I in the said Act to levy tax. Therefore, DTH
service and cricket tournaments conducted by the IPL were brought within the definition of the term
‘entertainment’.

5.23 Aggrieved, several DTH service providers preferred Writ Petitions before Madras High Court
challenging the levy of entertainment tax. By judgment dated 19.10.2012, the High Court accepted
the contention of DTH service providers that the charging section was defective and the levy of
entertainment tax is contrary to Article 14; however, the High Court held that the State Legislature
was competent to levy tax on the entertainment aspect of the DTH services.
5.24 Learned senior counsel submitted that while construing an entry in a List conferring legislative
power, the widest possible construction according to their ordinary meaning must be given to the
words used therein. – vide Navinchandra Mafatlal vs. Commissioner of Income-Tax, Bombay City,
AIR 1955 SC 58. It was submitted that the most liberal and widest construction must be given to
accommodate within an organic Constitution the changing meaning of the text in tune with an
evolving society. In that context, it was submitted that in today’s society, it is pedantic to contend
that the term ‘entertainment’ does not cover within its ambit DTH service providers. Furthermore, it
was argued that merely because individuals can derive entertainment in their private space does not
denude the public character of entertainment through DTH services. The facility of choosing the
time, place, mode or content does not convert entertainment through DTH into private
entertainment and therefore, the subject matter of tax is not a justifiable ground to read any
limitation into this expression.
5.25 Learned senior counsel vehemently argued that the theory of occupied field advanced by the
appellants herein has already been rejected by this Court. Our attention was drawn to the judgment
of Madras High Court dated 30.11.1994 in Tamil Nadu Cable TV Organisers vs. Government of
Tamil Nadu, W.P. No. 16237/1994. Therein, Section 4-E of the State legislation which levied an
entertainment tax on the entertainment aspect of service provided by cable operators was
challenged in the aforementioned petition before the Madras High Court. Rejecting the challenge, it
was held that there being nothing in Entry 62 – List II to warrant a restrictive meaning, the
definition of entertainment would not be restricted to cinematographic exhibitions alone and would
include other forms of entertainment as well. It was submitted that the challenge made therein was
most similar to the challenge made here against Section 4-I of the same Act. As noted, the Madras
High Court rejected the restricted interpretation of entertainments and rejected the contention
based on the theory of occupied field as it found that in pith and substance the impugned legislation
fell within Entry 62 - List II. Thereafter, an appeal was preferred before this Court by cable TV
operators which was rejected in Suresh, while observing that there was no reason as to why the
entertainment aspect of the transaction could not be taxed. 5.26 It was further argued that in India,
the subject of tax can be the person, thing or activity on which the tax is imposed and herein the
subject of tax is the receiver of entertainment by subscription to DTH: Godfrey Phillips.
5.27 Sri Radhakrishnan referred to the distinct and different senses in which the words ‘levied’,
‘paid’ and ‘recoverable’ are used in Section 4-I of the Act. While the tax is ‘levied’ on entertainment,
it is ‘paid’ on all payments for admission to an entertainment and it is ‘recovered’ by the proprietor
and paid to the government. Sri Radhakrishnan also agreed that even if the DTH service provider
only acts as a conduit between content providers and the subscribers, since it is clarified that the
subject matter of the tax is the entertainment derived from the content, there is no scope for
confusing the entertainment with the service of enabling the flow of content through the DTH
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
31
system. It was also argued that there are two aspects of the DTH service; i.e. the service aspect and
the entertainment aspect. The taxable event for the former being the flow of content through
satellites and for the latter being the entertainment derived from the subscription of the content.
5.28 It was also canvassed that the specific power of taxation within the legislative competence of
State of Tamil Nadu cannot be fettered by the general power of regulation or the residuary power of
taxation available to the Union Government under Entry 31 or even Entry 97 – List I. It was
contended that this Court has already observed that legislative competence of the State to levy
entertainment tax could not be fettered by the enactment of any regulatory enactment law, vide
Purvi Communication. 5.29 It was therefore contended that the state’s specific power of taxation
cannot be cut down by regulatory power of the Union. To assail any question of overlapping in the
present case, learned senior counsel submitted that Entry 62 – List II operates in an entirely
different sphere to that of Entry 92C or Entry 97 – List I. 5.30 It was further contended that a
reading of Entry 33 – List II makes it evident that entertainment and amusement is a class by itself
not subject to Entry 60 – List I. Although cinemas mentioned in Entry 33 – List II are made subject
to Entry 60 – List I relating to sanctioning of cinematographic films for exhibition, but other forms
of entertainment qua which general power of regulation is given to the state are not made subject to
any entries in List I. 5.31 It was reiterated that this Court has held that under the Indian
Constitution, the scheme of division of taxing powers is not based on any criterion depending on the
incidence of the tax. – Chhotabhai Jethabhai Patel and Co. vs. Union of India, AIR 1962 SC 1006.
The importance of the doctrine of pith and substance in deciding the scope of legislation qua the
entries in the three Lists was also emphasized. - MPV Sundararamier & Co. vs. State of Andhra
Pradesh, AIR 1958 SC 468 (“MPV Sundararamier”). It was also contended that to decide the true
nature and character of a particular levy with reference to legislative competence, the Court has to
look into the pith and substance of the legislation as a whole. - All India Federation of Tax
Practitioners. On an application of the aforesaid principles to the facts of these cases, the learned
senior counsel concluded that taxes on DTH service is on a different subject when compared to taxes
on entertainment as the pith and substance of the relevant state legislation is to tax the subject of
entertainment. 5.32 Sri Radhakrishnan submitted that the question in Geeta Enterprises was
limited to the interpretation of the word ‘entertainment’ as used in Section 2(3) of the United
Provinces Entertainment and Betting Tax Act, 1937 and therefore non- consideration of the ratio of
the said case does not make the judgment in Purvi Communication bad in law.
5.33 Additionally, it was also argued that DTH operators are not merely engaged as conduits in the
service of broadcasting but also create their exclusive content and channels available to their
subscribers.
State of Rajasthan:
5.34 Dr. Manish Singhvi, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the State of
Rajasthan, submitted that if the activity of the petitioners is within Entry 62 – List II
then nothing more is to be seen and the imposition of service tax is wholly irrelevant.
After taking us through the provisions of the relevant Act promulgated by the State of
Rajasthan Act, it was argued that imposition of service tax is not a tax on
entertainment, validity of which needs to be determined only by testing if in pith and

substance it is traceable to Entry 62 – List II.
State of Punjab:
5.35 Learned senior counsel Sri Farasat appearing for the State of Punjab, argued
that broadcasting is merely a means to the entertainment derived, by the content
being delivered and that the imposition of service tax would not detract from the
competence of the State Legislature to levy entertainment tax under Entry 62 – List
II. In the absence of any conclusive intent apparent from the Constituent Assembly
Debates, he argued against drawing any myopic inference on the scope of Entry 62 –
List II.
State of Nagaland:
5.36 Ms. K. Enatoli Sema, learned counsel appearing for the State of Nagaland in
W.P.(C) No.699/2014, brought to our attention that the relevant state Act was
amended in the year 2011 and that the definition of entertainment includes DTH
operators. That the enactment promulgated by the State of Nagaland has not been
challenged and that in fact even after filing of the writ petition, entertainment tax has
in fact been paid by the writ petitioner without any protest.
State of Andhra Pradesh:
5.37 Sri Sahel, learned counsel appearing for the State of Andhra Pradesh in W.P.(C)
No.748/2015, similarly highlighted that there is no challenge to the State Act in the
writ petition.
Union of India:
5.38 Learned senior counsel Ms. Nisha Bagchi appearing for the Union of India in
W.P.(C) No.699/2014, submitted that the issue of service tax has been conceded in
almost all High Courts and has not been disputed as such. She submitted that in view
of the dismissal of the C.A. No. 261/2013 and C.A. Nos. 1582-1583/2020 the prayers
(a) and (b) in W.P. Nos. 699/2014 and 748/2015 do not survive for consideration.
She particularly highlighted that the Delhi High Court dismissed the challenge to the
constitutional validity of service tax, as did Madras High Court, on the basis of
categorical concessions made by the assessees. Learned senior counsel also submitted
that no controversy with regard to payment of service tax arises in the Civil Appeal
arising from the decision of the Kerala High Court.
Reply Arguments:
5.39 We have heard the arguments made by way of reply by the respective senior
counsel and counsel appearing for the parties. 5.40 We have perused the voluminous
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
33
material on record as well as the judicial dicta cited before us.
Points for Consideration:
6. Whether the judgments of the High Courts (Eleven High Courts) impugned in these cases would
call for any interference and if so, to what extent?
6.1 Whether Purvi Communications has been correctly decided by this Court?
6.2 Whether the prayers sought for in the writ petitions are to be granted and if so, to what extent?
6.3 What order?
6.4 On 11.09.2024, learned senior counsel Ms. Nisha Bagchi submitted that in view of the dismissal
of CA No.261/2013 and CA Nos.1582-1583/2020 by this Court, prayers (a) and (b) in WP
Nos.699/2014 and 748/2015 would not survive for consideration. By way of response, learned
senior counsel Sri Bagaria has also conceded that the controversy in these writ petitions is
essentially on the imposition of entertainment tax and therefore, prayer (a) in the writ petitions
would not be pressed.
6.5 His submission is placed on record.
6.6 Learned senior counsel Ms. Bagchi also submitted that in the Civil Appeal which arises from the
decision of the Kerala High Court dealing with luxury tax, there is no controversy with regard to the
payment of service tax by appellants therein. 6.7 The said position is not disputed at the Bar. 6.8 In
view of the aforesaid submissions, the issue regarding the payment of service tax on broadcasting
service would be considered only in light of the issue whether the activity of the appellants herein is
within the scope and ambit of Entry 62 – List II, namely, providing entertainment to the subscribers
or receivers of entertainment by means of broadcasting through television channels and the relevant
technology applicable for providing entertainment through television to the subscribers. 6.9 In view
of the fact that the correctness of the findings of the High Court of Madras with regard to the
charging section of the State enactment being defective is assailed by the State of Tamil Nadu in
separate appeals which are not part of this batch of appeals, the question of correctness or otherwise
of the finding of the High Court does not come up for our consideration here. Legal Framework:
7. Before proceeding further, it is useful to refer to the relevant provisions of the Constitution,
relevant entries of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution and the relevant provisions of the State
Act under considerations. We also would advert to the relevant provisions of the Finance Act, 1994
as amended from time to time having a bearing on the controversy in question. 7.1 The following
provisions of the Constitution of India are adverted to as under:
“245. Extent of laws made by Parliament and by the Legislatures of States.—(1)
Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, Parliament may make laws for the
whole or any part of the territory of India, and the Legislature of a State may make

laws for the whole or any part of the State.
(2) No law made by Parliament shall be deemed to be invalid on the ground that it
would have extra-territorial operation.
246. Subject-matter of laws made by Parliament and by the Legislatures of States.- (1)
Notwithstanding anything in clauses (2) and (3), Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with

(2) Such power shall include the power of making any law imposing a tax not mentioned in either of
those Lists.
xxx
265. Taxes not to be imposed save by authority of law.—No tax shall be levied or collected except by
authority of law.” Relevant Entries of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution:
7.2 In order to understand the foundation of the controversy in these cases, it is
necessary to consider Article 246 of the Constitution and the relevant entries of the
two Lists which can be usefully extracted as under:
“List I – Union List xxx
31. Posts and telegraphs; telephones, wireless, broadcasting and other like forms of
communication.
xxx 92C. Taxes on Services.

Finance Act, 1994 with Relevant Amendments:
7.3 Chapter V of the Finance Act, 1994 (2001 amended) which deals with various
types of service tax, perhaps under the said Act has defined “broadcasting” as under-
"65. Definitions.- In this Chapter unless the context otherwise requires,-
(13) "broadcasting" has the meaning assigned to it in clause (c) of Section 2 of the
Prasar Bharti (Broadcasting Corporation of India) Act, 1990 (25 of 1990);"
7.3.1 In view of the aforesaid definition reference has to be made to Section 2 (c) of the Prasar Bharti
(Broadcasting Corporation of India) Act, 1990 (“Prasar Bharti Act, 1990”, for short), which define
“broadcasting” as under:-
“2. Definitions- In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,-
(c) broadcasting' means the dissemination of any form of communication like signs,
signals, writing, pictures, images and sounds of all kinds by transmission of
electro-magnetic waves through space or through cables intended to be received by
the general public either directly or indirectly through the medium of relay stations
and all its grammatical variations and cognate expressions shall be construed
accordingly."
7.3.2 Section 65(63) of the Finance Act, 1994 (amended in 2001) defines "service tax" as under:
"65. Definitions.- In this Chapter unless the context otherwise requires,-
(63) "service tax" means tax leviable under the provisions of this Chapter;"
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
36
7.3.3 Section 65 (72) (zk) defines “taxable service” with regard to “broadcasting agency” as a “service
provider” as under:
"65. Definitions.- In this Chapter unless the context otherwise requires,-
(72) "taxable service" means any service provided,-
xxx (zk) to a client, by a broadcasting agency or organization in relation to
broadcasting, in any manner;
And the term "service provider" shall be construed accordingly;"
7.3.4 Section 66(5) specifics the quantum of tax liability on a 'service provider"
providing broadcasting services which is extracted as :
"66. Charge of service tax.-(5) With effect from the date notified under Section 137 of
the Finance Act, 2001, there shall be levied a service tax at the rate of five per Cent of
the value of the taxable services referred to in sub-clauses (za), (zb), (zc), (zd), (ze),
(zf), (zg), (zh), (zi), (zj), (zk), (zl), (zm), (zn) and (zo) of clause (72) of Section 65 and
collected in such manner as may be prescribed."
Thus, tax at the rate of five per cent of the value of taxable services was levied on a broadcasting
agency (i.e. five per cent of the gross amount charged by the service provider). 7.3.5 The term
"broadcasting" was re-defined under Section 65(14) of the Finance Act, 1994 by way of 2002
Amendment which reads as under:-
"65. Definitions.- In this Chapter, unless the context otherwise requires,-
(14). "broadcasting" has the meaning assigned to it in clause(c) of Section 2 of the
Prasar Bharti (Broadcasting Corporation of India) Act, 1990 (25 of 1990) and also
includes programme selection, scheduling or presentation of sound or visual matter
on a radio or a television channel that is intended for public listening or viewing, as
the case may be;
and in the case of a broadcasting agency or organization, having its head office situated in any place
outside India, includes the activity of selling of time slots or obtaining sponsorships for broadcasting
of any programme or collecting the broadcasting charges on behalf of the said agency or
organization, by its branch office or subsidiary or representative in India or any agent appointed in
India or by any person who acts on its behalf in any manner;"
7.3.6 The term "broadcasting agency or organization" was also re- defined under
Section 65(15) by way of an amendment in the year 2002 to the Finance Act, 1994,
which is extracted as under:-

37
"65. Definitions.- In this Chapter, unless the context otherwise requires,-

case of a broadcasting agency or organization, having its head office situated in any
place outside India, includes its branch office or subsidiary or representative in India
or any agent appointed in India or any person who acts on its behalf in any manner,
engaged in the activity of selling of time slots for broadcasting of any programme or
obtaining sponsorships for programme or collecting broadcasting charges on behalf
of the said agency or organization;"
7.3.7 Section 65 (80) defines the term “service tax” by way of an amendment to the Finance Act,
1994 in the year 2002, which reads as under:-
"65. Definitions.- In this Chapter, unless the context otherwise requires,-
(80) "service tax" means tax leviable under the provisions of this Chapter;"
7.3.8 Section 65 (90) (zk) again while defining "taxable services", it included therein a "broadcasting
agency" as a "service provider". Section 65 (90) (zk) of the Finance Act, 2002 is reproduced
hereunder:-
"65. Definitions.- In this Chapter, unless the context otherwise requires,-
xxx (90). ''taxable service" means any service provided,- (zk) to a client, by a
broadcasting agency or organization in relation to broadcasting in any manner and,
in the case of a broadcasting agency or organization, having its head office situated in

representative in India or any agent appointed in India or by any person who acts on
its behalf in any manner, engaged in the activity of selling of time slots for
broadcasting of any programme or obtaining sponsorships for programme or
collecting broadcasting charges on behalf of the said agency or organization.
Explanation.- For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that so long as the radio or television
programme broadcast is received in India and intended for listening or viewing, as the case may be,
by the public, such service shall be a taxable service in relation to broadcasting, even if the
encryption of the signals or beaming thereof through the satellite might have taken place outside
India;
And the term "service provider" shall be construed accordingly;"
7.3.9 Section 66 (5) of the Finance Act, 2002 specified the quantum of tax liability on
a service provider, providing broadcasting service to the following effect. Section
66(5) aforesaid is reproduced hereunder:-

"66. Charge of service tax.-(5) With effect from the date notified under Section 137 of
the Finance Act, 2001 (14 of 2001), there shall be levied a service tax at the rate of

(zc), (zd), (ze), (zf), (zg), (zh), (zi), (zj), (zk), (zl), (zm), (zn) and (zo) of clause (90) of
Section 65 and collected in such manner as may be prescribed."
7.3.10 A perusal of the provisions of the Finance Act, 2002 reveals, that as hitherto before (under
the Finance Act 2001) service tax at the rate of five per cent of the value of taxable service was
leviable on a service provider rendering broadcasting services (i.e. five per cent of the gross amount
charged by the service provider) even under the Finance Act, 2002.
7.3.11 Under the Finance Act, 2003, the term "broadcasting" was re-defined through Section 65(15),
which is being extracted hereunder:-
"65. Definitions.- In this Chapter, unless the context otherwise requires.-
xxx (15) '(broadcasting" has the meaning assigned to it in clause (c) of Section 2 of the
Prasar Bharti (Broadcasting Corporation of India) Act, 1990 ( 25 of 1990) and also

the case may be;
and in the case of a broadcasting agency or organization, having its head office situated in any place

of any programme or collecting the broadcasting charges on behalf of the said agency or
organization, by its branch office or subsidiary or representative in India or any agent appointed in
India or by any person who acts on its behalf in any manner;"
7.3.12 The Finance Act, 2003 also defined the term ''broadcasting agency or
organization" in Section 65(16). Section 65(16) of the Finance Act, 2003 is also being
reproduced hereunder:-
"65. Definitions.- In this Chapter, unless the context otherwise requires.-
(16) "broadcasting agency or organization" means any agency or organization

Section 65 (95) aforesaid is being reproduced hereunder:-
"65. Definitions.- In this Chapter, unless the context otherwise requires.-
xxx (95) “service tax” mean tax leviable under the provisions of this chapter;"
7.3.14 Section 65 (105) (zk) of the Finance Act, 2003 again while defining the term 'taxable service",
it included therein a "broadcasting agency" as a 'service provider". Section 65(105) (2k) aforesaid is
being extracted hereunder:
"65. Definitions.- In this Chapter, unless the context otherwise requires.-
xxx (105) “taxable service" means any service provided,-
(zk) to a client, by a broadcasting agency or organization in relation to broadcasting

or by any person who acts on its behalf in any manner, engaged in the activity of
selling of time slots for broadcasting of any programme or obtaining sponsorships for

organization.
Explanation.- For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that so long as the radio or television
programme broadcast is received in India and intended for listening or viewing, as the case may be,
by the public, such service shall be a taxable ser vice in relation to broadcasting, even if the
encryption of signals or beaming thereof through the satellite might have taken place outside India;"
and the term "service provider" shall be construed accordingly;” 7.3.15 Section 66(1)
of the Finance Act, 2003 specified, that quantum of tax liability on a service provider
providing broadcasting services as under:-
"66. Charge of service tax.-(l) There shall be levied a tax (hereinafter referred to as
the service tax) at the rate of eight per cent of the value of the taxable services
referred to in sub-clauses (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k),

(zw), (zx), (zy), (zz) and (zza) of clause (105) of Section 65 and collected in such
manner as may be prescribed.” 7.3.16 A perusal of the aforesaid provisions reveals,
that under the Finance Act, 2001, service tax levied on service providers rendering
broadcasting services were enhanced from five per cent to six per cent of the value of
taxable service (i.e. eight per cent of the gross amount charged by the service
provider) under the Finance Act, 2003.

7.3.17 The provisions of the Finance Act, 2004 on the subject matter of the controversy in hand were
identical to the ones incorporated under the Finance Act, 2002, and as such, the relevant provisions
of the Finance Act, 2004 are not being reproduced here.
7.3.18 Insofar as the Finance Act, 2005 is concerned, it re- defined the term "broadcasting" under
Section 65(16). Section 65(16) of the Finance Act, 2005 is being reproduced hereunder:-
"65. Definitions.- In this Chapter, unless the context otherwise requires.-
xxx (15) “broadcasting” has the meaning assigned to it in clause (c) of Section 2 of the
Prasar Bharti (Broadcasting Corporation of India) Act, 1990 ( 25 of 1990) and also
includes programme selection, scheduling or presentation of sound or visual matter
on a radio or a television channel that is intended for public listening or viewing, as
the case may be;
and in the case of a broadcasting agency or organization, having its head office situated in any place
outside India, includes the activity of selling of time slots or obtaining sponsorships for broadcasting
of any programme or collecting the broadcasting charges or permitting the rights to receive any
form of communication like sign, signal, writing, picture, image and sounds of all kinds by

by any other means to cable operator including multisystem operator or any other person on behalf
of the said agency or organization, by its branch office or subsidiary or representative in India or any
agent appointed in India or by any person who acts on its behalf in any manner;"
7.3.19 Likewise, the term "broadcasting agency or organization" was again re-defined
under Section 65(16) of the Finance Act, 2005, which is being reproduced
hereunder:-
"65. Definitions.- In this Chapter, unless the context otherwise requires.-
xxx (16) "broadcasting agency or organization" means any agency or organization
engaged in providing service in relation to broadcasting in any manner and, in the
case of a broadcasting agency or organization, having its head office situated in any

picture, image and sounds of all kinds by transmission of electro-magnetic waves
through space or through cables, direct to home multisystem operator or any other
person on behalf of the said agency or organization;"
7.3.20 The term "service tax" retained the same definition as was assigned to it by the Finance Act,
2003 even for the Finance Act, 2005. However, sub-clause (zk) as defined in the Finance Act, 2005
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025

was given a different meaning and effect. In this behalf Section 65(105)(zk) of the Finance Act, 2005
is being reproduced hereunder:-
"65. Definitions.- In this Chapter, unless the context otherwise requires,-
xxx (105) "taxable service" means any service provided,- (zk) to a client, by a
broadcasting agency or organization in relation to broadcasting in any manner and,

communication like sign, signal, writing, picture, image and sounds of all kinds by
transmission of electro-magnetic waves through space or through cables, direct to
home signals or by any other means to cable operator, including multisystem
operator or any other person on behalf of the said agency or organization.
Explanation.- For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that so long as the radio or television
programme broadcast is received in India and intended for listening or viewing, as the case may be,
by the public, such service shall be a taxable service in relation to broadcasting, even if the
encryption of signals or beaming thereof through the satellite might have taken place outside India;
and the term "service provider" shall be construed accordingly;"
7.3.21 The quantum of service tax under the Finance Act 2005, on service providers,
rendering broadcasting services was sustained at the same rate as in the preceding
Finance Act, 2004. 7.3.22 A perusal of the provisions of the various Finance Acts
reproduced hereinabove, according to the learned counsel for the petitioners, reveals,
that "service tax" was levied on "Direct-to- Home" (DTH) broadcasting services
thereunder. The aforesaid 'legislation, according' to the learned counsel for the
petitioners had obviously been enacted by the Parliament under Entry 92C of the
Union List, contained in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.

Section 2(g) has been amended as under –
(g) “Entertainment” includes Direct-to-Home Broadcasting service and any and any
exhibition, performance, amusement, game, sport or race (including horse race) to
which persons are admitted for payment and in the case of cinematograph exhibition,
includes exhibition of news-
reel, documentaries, cartoons, advertisement shorts or slides, whether before or during the
exhibition of a feature film or separately.” Interpretation of Entries of the Lists of the Seventh
Schedule of the Constitution:
8. With regard to the distribution of legislative subjects under the three Lists of the
Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, it is necessary to state that the Devolution
Rules drawn under the Government of India Act, 1919 and thereafter the Government
of India Act, 1935 are the precursors to the distribution of legislative powers between
the Union and the States. Some of the salient aspects concerning the distribution of
legislative powers between the Parliament and State Legislature as per the three Lists
in the backdrop of constitutional provisions could be alluded to. Article 246 of the
Constitution deals with the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and
the States. The said Article has to be read along with the three Lists, namely, the
Union List, the State List and the Concurrent List. The taxing powers of the Union as
well as the States are also demarcated as separate entries in the Union List as well as
the State List i.e. List I and List II respectively.
The entries in the Lists are fields of legislative powers conferred under Article 246 of the
Constitution. In other words, the entries define the areas of legislative competence of the Union and
the State Legislature. (vide: State of Karnataka). 8.1 The legislative power to impose a tax or impost
can be traced to either List I - Union List or List II - State List. List III - Concurrent List which gives
powers to both Union as well as the States to legislate on a subject does not contain any taxation
entry. Entry 47 - List III states that fees in respect of any of the matters in that List but not including
fees taken in any Court could be levied and collected by an authority of law either by the Union or
the State Legislature. Similarly, Entry 66 - List II states that fees in respect of any of the matters in
List II but not including fees taken in any Court could be collected by the State Legislature. In a
similar vein, Entry 96 - List I gives power to levy fee in respect of subjects enumerated in List I but
not including fees taken in any Court.
8.2 On the aspect of interpretation of legislative entries in the three Lists, the principles are apposite
as discussed in State of Karnataka:
8.2.1 The power to legislate which is dealt with under Article 246 has to be read in
conjunction with the entries in the three Lists discussed above which define the
respective areas of legislative competence of the Union and State Legislatures. While
interpreting these entries, they should not be viewed in a narrow or myopic manner
but by giving the widest scope to their meaning, particularly, when the vires of a
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
74
provision of a statue is assailed. In such circumstances, a liberal construction must be
given to the entry by looking at the substance of the legislation and not its mere form.
8.2.2 However, while interpreting the entries, in the case of an apparent conflict
between the entries in the Lists, every attempt must be made by the Court to
harmonise or reconcile them. Where there is an apparent overlapping between two
entries, the doctrine of pith and substance is applied to find out the true character of
the enactment and the entry within which it would fall. The doctrine of pith and
substance, in short, means, if an enactment substantially falls within the powers
expressly conferred by the Constitution upon the legislature which enacted it, the
same cannot be held to be invalid merely because it incidentally encroaches on
matters assigned to another legislature. Also, in a situation where there is
overlapping, the said doctrine has to be applied to determine to which entry, a piece
of legislation could be related to by examining the true character of the enactment or
a provision thereof. Due regard must be had to the enactment as a whole and to its
scope and objects. It is said that the question of invasion into another legislative
territory has to be determined by substance and not by degree. According to the pith
and substance doctrine, if a law is in its pith and substance within the competence of
the Legislature which has made it, it will not be invalid because it incidentally
touches upon the subject lying within the competence of another Legislature.
8.2.3 In case of any conflict between entries in List I and List II, the power of
Parliament to legislate under List I will supersede when, on an interpretation, the two
powers cannot be reconciled.
But if a legislation in pith and substance falls within any of the entries of List II, the State
Legislature's competence cannot be questioned on the ground that the field is covered by Union list
or the Concurrent list (vide Prafulla Kumar Mukherjee vs. Bank of Commerce, Khulna, AIR 1947
P.C. 60). It was further observed that in distinguishing between the powers of the divided
jurisdictions under Lists I, II and III of the Seventh Schedule to the Government of India Act, 1935,
it is not possible to make a clean cut between the powers of the various legislatures. They are bound
to overlap from time to time, and the rule which has been evolved by the Judicial Committee
whereby an impugned statute is examined to ascertain its pith and substance or its true character
for the purpose of determining in which particular list the legislation falls, applies to Indian as well
as to Dominion legislation. 8.2.4 The Privy Council quoted with approval, the observations of
Gwyer, CJ in A.L.S.P.P.L. Subrahmanyan Chettiar vs. Muttuswami Goundan, AIR 1941 FC 47
wherein it was observed that overlapping of subject-matter is not avoided by substituting three lists
for two, or even by arranging for a hierarchy of jurisdictions. It was observed that “Subjects must
still overlap, and where they do the question must be asked what in pith and substance is the effect
of the enactment of which complaint is made, and in what list is its true nature and character to be
found. If these questions could not be asked, much beneficent legislation would be stifled at birth,
and many of the subjects entrusted to provincial legislation could never effectively be dealt with”. In
the said case, it was further observed that the dominant position of the Central Legislature
(Parliament) with regard to matters in List I and List III is established. But the rigour of the literal
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
75
interpretation is relaxed by the use of the words “with respect to” which signify “pith and
substance”, and do not forbid a mere incidental encroachment. The learned Chief Justice Gwyer
further added as under:
“It must inevitably happen from time to time that legislation, though purporting to
deal with a subject in one list, touches also on a subject in another list, and the
different provisions of the enactment may be so closely intertwined that blind
adherence to a strictly verbal interpretation would result in a large number of
statutes being declared invalid because the Legislature enacting them may appear to
have legislated in a forbidden sphere. Hence the rule which has been evolved by the
Judicial Committee whereby the impugned statute is examined to ascertain its “pith
and substance”, or its “true nature and character,” for the purpose of determining
whether it is legislation with respect to matters in this list or in that.” 8.2.5 Where
one entry is made “subject to” another entry, all that it means is that out of the scope
of the former entry, a field of legislation covered by the latter entry has been reserved
to be specially dealt with by the appropriate legislature. Also, when one entry is
general and another specific, the latter will exclude the former on a subject of
legislation. If, however, they cannot be fairly reconciled, the power enumerated in
List II must give way to List I. 8.2.6 But once the legislation is found to be ‘with
respect to’ the legislative entry in question, unless there are other constitutional
prohibitions, the power would be unfettered. It would also extend to all ancillary and
subsidiary matters which can fairly and reasonably be said to be comprehended in
that topic or category of legislation (vide United Provinces vs. Atiqa Begum, AIR 1941
FC 16).
8.2.7 Another important aspect while construing the entries in the respective Lists is
that every attempt should be made by the Court to harmonise the contents of the
entries so that interpretation of one entry should not render the entire content of
another entry nugatory (vide Calcutta Gas Company Ltd. vs. State of West Bengal,
AIR 1962 SC 1044). This is especially so when some of the entries in a different List
or in the same List may overlap or may appear to be in direct conflict with each other.
In such a situation, a duty is cast on the Court to reconcile the entries and bring about
a harmonious construction. Thus, an effort must be made to give effect to both
entries and thereby arrive at a reconciliation or harmonious construction of the same.
It is only when such attempt to reconcile fails that the non-obstante clause in Article
246(1) should be applied as a matter of last resort as observed in Re: The Central
Provinces and Berar Sales of Motor Spirit and Lubricants Taxation Act, 1938, AIR
1939 FC 1 by Gwyer, C.J. in the following words:
“for the clause ought to be regarded as a last resource, a witness to the imperfections
of human expression and the fallibility of legal draftsmanship”.
8.2.8 The sequitur to the aforesaid discussion is that if the Legislature passes a law
which is beyond its legislative competence, it is a nullity ab-initio. The legislation is
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
76
rendered null and void for want of jurisdiction or legislative competence vide RMD
Chamarbaugwalla vs. Union of India, AIR 1957 SC 628.
8.2.9 On a close perusal of the entries in the three Lists, it is discerned that the
Constitution has divided the topics of legislation into the following three broad
categories:
(i)     Entries enabling laws to be made;
(ii)    Entries enabling taxes to be imposed; and
(iii) Entries enabling fees and stamp duties to be collected.
8.2.10 Lists I and II are divided essentially into two groups :
one, relating to the power to legislate on specified subjects and the other, relating to
the power to tax. Thus, the entries on levy of taxes are specifically mentioned.
Therefore, as such, there cannot be a conflict of taxation power of the Union and the
State. Thus, in substance the taxing power can be derived only from a specific taxing
entry in an appropriate List. Such a power has to be determined by the nature of the
tax and not the measure or machinery set up by the statute. In Hoechst
Pharmaceuticals, it has been categorically held that taxation is considered as a
distinct matter for purposes of legislative competence. 8.2.11 It would be relevant to
discuss the following two judgments of this Court in detail in order to bring out the
pertinent principles of interpretation of taxation entries in List II even when
regulation of an activity is provided under an entry in List I. They are: (i) MPV
Sundararamier and Union of India vs. H.S. Dhillon, (1971) 2 SCC 779 (“H.S.
Dhillon”). 8.2.12 In paragraph 51 of MPV Sundararamier, it was observed as under:
“51. In List I Entries 1 to 81 mention the several matters over which Parliament has
authority to legislate. Entries 82 to 92 enumerate the taxes which could be imposed
by a law of Parliament. An examination of these two groups of entries shows that
while the main subject of legislation figures in the first group, a tax in relation thereto
is separately mentioned in the second. Thus, Entry 22 in List I is “Railways”, and
Entry 89 is “Terminal taxes on goods or passengers, carried by railway, sea or air;
taxes on railway fares and freights”. If Entry 22 is to be construed as involving taxes
to be imposed, then Entry 89 would be superfluous. Entry 41 mentions “Trade and
commerce with foreign countries; import and export across customs frontiers”. If
these expressions are to be interpreted as including duties to be levied in respect of
that trade and commerce, then Entry 83 which is “Duties of customs including export
duties” would be wholly redundant.
Entries 43 and 44 relate to incorporation, regulation and winding up of corporations. Entry 85
provides separately for corporation tax. Turning to List II, Entries 1 to 44 form one group
mentioning the subjects on which the States could legislate. Entries 45 to 63 in that List form
another group, and they deal with taxes. Entry 18, for example, is “Land” and Entry 45 is “Land
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
77
revenue”. Entry 23 is “Regulation of mines” and Entry 50 is “Taxes on mineral rights”. The above
analysis—and it is not exhaustive of the entries in the Lists—leads to the inference that taxation is
not intended to be comprised in the main subject in which it might on an extended construction be
regarded as included, but is treated as a distinct matter for purposes of legislative competence. And
this distinction is also manifest in the language of Article 248 clauses (1) and (2) and of Entry 97 in
List I of the Constitution. Construing Entry 42 in the light of the above scheme, it is difficult to resist
the conclusion that the power of Parliament to legislate on inter-State trade and commerce under
Entry 42 does not include a power to impose a tax on sales in the course of such trade and
commerce.” On the above analysis, it was categorically inferred in MPV Sundararamier that taxation
was not intended to be comprised in the main subject in which it might, on extended construction,
be regarded as included but is to be treated as a distinct matter for the purpose of legislative
competence. But while saying so, in the said case, reliance was also placed on Article 286 of the
Constitution.
8.2.13 It was observed in H.S. Dhillon that Entry 97 - List I conferred the residuary powers on
Parliament. Article 248 of the Constitution which speaks of residuary powers of legislation confers
exclusive power on Parliament to make any law with reference to any matter not enumerated in the
Concurrent List or the State List. But at the same time, it provides that such a residuary power shall
include a power of making any law imposing a tax not mentioned in either of those Lists. It is thus
clear that if any power to tax is clearly mentioned in List II, the same would not be available to be
exercised by Parliament based on the assumption of a residuary power.
8.2.14 In fact, the judgment in H.S. Dhillon was by a majority of 4 : 3 to the effect that the power to
legislate in respect of a matter does not carry with it a power to impose a tax under our
constitutional scheme. Thus, there is nothing like an implied power to tax. The source of power to
legislate on a subject which does not specifically speak of taxation cannot be so interpretated by
expanding its width as to include therein the power to tax, by implication or by necessary inference.
Reliance was also placed on Cooley on Taxation to the following effect:
“There is no such thing as taxation by implication. The burden is always upon the
taxing authority to point to the act of assembly which authorises the imposition of the
tax claimed.” 8.2.15 Thus, the power to tax is not an incidental power.
Although legislative power includes incidental and subsidiary power under a particular entry dealing
with a particular subject, the power to impose a tax is not such a power which could be implied
under our Constitution. Therefore, it was held that the power to legislate in respect of inter-State
trade and commerce (Entry 42 -List I) did not carry with it the power to tax the sale of goods which
are subject of inter-State trade and commerce, before the insertion of Entry 92-A - List I and such
power belonged to the States under Entry 54 - List II subject to Article 286 of the Constitution. (See:
Builders’ Association of India vs. Union of India, (1989) 2 SCC 645) 8.2.16 Delving further on the
distinction between the power to regulate and control and the power to tax, it has been observed by
this Court that there is a significant distinction between the two primary purposes of legislation. The
primary purpose of taxation is to collect revenue. Power to tax may be exercised for regulating an
industry, commerce or any other activity. The purpose of levying such tax is the exercise of sovereign
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/

power for effectuating regulation although incidentally, the levy may contribute to the revenue.
Taking a leaf from Cooley on his work on taxation, it was observed that the distinction between a
demand of money under the police power and one made under the power to tax, is not so much one
of form as of substance.
8.2.17 In view of the detailed discussion made above, we find that the dictum of this Court in MPV
Sundararamier analysing the entries in Lists I and II dealing with various subjects of legislation and
entries concerning taxation being separate and distinct must be borne in mind while interpreting
the impugned provisions of the State Acts. That is the constitutional scheme. In this regard, we
reiterate what has been observed in Hoechst Pharmaceuticals, to the effect that taxation is
considered to be a distinct matter for purposes of legislative competence and the power to tax
cannot be deduced from the general legislative entry as an ancillary power. Also, a power to legislate
as to the principal matter specifically mentioned in the entry shall also include within its expanse
legislation touching only upon incidental and ancillary matters. But the power to levy tax cannot be
considered to be an incidental and ancillary matter while interpreting an entry in the Lists
concerning legislative competence of Parliament or legislature of any State to enact laws on the
subjects mentioned in the entry. 8.2.18 As a sequitur, it is observed that Entry 97 - List I which is the
residuary entry relatable to Article 248 of the Constitution cannot be invoked or pressed into service
when a specific entry empowering Parliament or the Legislature of a State to pass laws regarding the
taxation on any subject is specifically enumerated either in List I or List II.
8.2.19 It would also be useful to mention that since the legislative competence to pass a law relating
to taxation being specific and distinct in List I or List II, such an entry is not found in List III. In
other words, both Parliament as well as the Legislature of a State cannot have the competence to
levy tax on a particular subject and hence, there is no specific entry regarding taxation in List III or
the Concurrent List. In fact, Entry 47 - List III refers only to power to impose “fees in respect of any
of the matters in the List but not including fees taken in any court”. The distinction between the
power to levy fees and the power to levy a tax is well known and it would not be necessary to go into
that aspect of the matter in the present cases except to highlight that there is no entry for taxation in
the Concurrent List. Therefore, while interpreting a taxation entry in List I or List II, all efforts must
be made to interpret them in such a way as to give content and meaning to the same having regard
to the constitutional scheme under which the distribution of legislative powers have been envisaged
in the Seventh Schedule and bearing in mind and the object and intent behind them. State of
Karnataka vs. State of Meghalaya:
8.3 The controversy in the aforesaid case was regarding the interpretation to be given
to the expression ‘betting and gambling’ in Entries 34 and 62 - List II of the Seventh
Schedule to the Constitution of India. Further, whether “lotteries organised by the
Government of India or the Government of a State”, which is a subject in Entry 40 -
List I also encompasses the power to levy tax on the said lotteries? Consequently,
whether under Entry 62 - List II the State Legislature is denuded of the power to levy
tax on the said subject? In other words, whether the subject covered in Entry 40 - List
I restricts the scope and ambit of Entries 34 and 62 - List II? If the answer is in the
affirmative, whether the State Legislatures have no legislative competence to levy tax
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
79
on lotteries organised by the Government of India or the Government of a State.
Consequently, the question in these cases was, whether, the Legislatures of the States of Karnataka
and Kerala had the legislative competence to enact the Karnataka Act, 2004 and the Kerala Act,
2005 respectively.
8.3.1 After examining the entries in List I and List II, it was observed that the expression “betting
and gambling” finds a mention in Entry 34 – List II and taxes on, inter alia, betting and gambling
are leviable having regard to Entry 62 – List II. Thus, the activity of betting and gambling and taxes
on betting and gambling are subjects falling within List II i.e. they are State subjects. If conduct of
lotteries is held to come within the scope of the expression ‘betting and gambling’ then the
regulation and control of the said activity as well as the taxation on lotteries are squarely within the
contours of the legislative powers of the State. However, only lotteries organised by the Government
of India or the Government of a State, even though, they come within the scope of the expression
‘betting and gambling’ have been carved out of Entry 34 - List II dealing with betting and gambling
inasmuch as Entry 40 - List I (Union List) deals with lotteries organised by the Government of India
or the Government of a State. This implies that conduct of lotteries by the Government of India or
the Government of a State, even though, is betting and gambling within the meaning of Entry 34
and Entry 62 - List II, nevertheless, those entries are denuded inasmuch as the State Legislature has
no legislative powers to pass any law on the subject lotteries organised by the Government of India
or the Government of a State. If such is the simplistic interpretation to be given, the matter would
rest. However, that is not so. This Court observed that:
“158.2 The expression “betting and gambling” is also found in Entry 34 of List II. We
have discussed at length above the content of the said expression and as to what it
encompasses. The activity of “betting and gambling” includes, inter alia, lotteries.
Lotteries can be conducted by the Government of India or the Government of States
or authorised by a State or be conducted by private entities in a State. Thus, a lottery
conducted by any of the above entities, Government or private is an activity falling
within the nomenclature of “betting and gambling” which is the subject in Entry 34
List II. But what has been carved out of Entry 34 of List II is only lotteries conducted
by the Government of India or the Government of any State. Therefore, all other
types of lotteries continue to remain within the scope and ambit of “betting and
gambling” as an activity in Entry 34 of List II.” 8.3.2 In the above backdrop, Entry 40
– List I and Entries 34 and 62 - List II were considered to assess whether there is any
apparent conflict or overlapping between the same. It was observed that with regard
to lotteries organized by the Government of India or Government of a State are
concerned, they continue to remain within the scope and ambit of Entry 62 - List II
dealing with, inter alia, betting and gambling in so far levy of tax is concerned. But in
order to have uniformity of laws throughout the country governing such lotteries, the
framers of the Constitution had intentionally included the said activity referred to
above in Entry 40 – List I. Consequently, Parliament has legislative competence to
pass laws on lotteries organized by the Government of India or the Government of
any State, uniformly throughout the country, as the conduct of such lotteries by the
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
80
sovereign State is a source of revenue. Therefore, in order to enhance the faith of the
people in the organization and conduct of such lotteries throughout the territories of
India by the Government of India or the Government of any State, the said regulation
by Parliament is enabled by placing the subject in Entry 40 – List I. Consequently,
the Lotteries (Regulation) Act, 1998 had been passed by Parliament which is
regulatory in nature. But the question, whether, while interpreting Entry 40 - List I
alongside Entries 34 and 62 - List II, the power to tax lotteries organized by
Government of India or the Government of a State was also taken away from Entry
62 - List II and was to be read within the ambit of Entry 40 - List I was considered. It
was held that the power to tax remains in Entry 62 – List II with the State Legislature
for which in paragraph 158 of the said judgment, twelve reasons were assigned. It was
ultimately held that Entry 62
- List II is a specific taxation entry on luxuries, including taxes on entertainments,
amusements, betting and gambling. Since lotteries conducted by any entity or
organization was nothing but betting and gambling, the State Legislatures would
have the power to tax lotteries under Entry 62 - List II as lotteries would come within
the nomenclature of betting and gambling irrespective of who conducts them.
8.4 Therefore, before approaching Entry 97 - List I which is a residuary entry in the
Union List (List I), it would be necessary to first interpret the relevant taxation entry
in the State List and it is only in the absence of there being legislative competence in
the relevant taxation entry in the State List could such a power be traced to Entry 97 -
List I in the residuary list provided such a power is not also traceable to any entry in
the Union List. This is because in List I itself the entries concerning taxation are
separate and distinct. Such entries are from Entries 82 to 92-B and Entry 96 - List I
deals with fees in respect of any of the matters in the List but not including fees taken
in any court. Therefore, the power to tax can be read under Entry 97- List I which is
only a residuary entry, if the same is not enumerated separately in List I or in List II
in which latter case it would come within the legislative competence of the State
Legislature.
8.5 From the aforesaid discussion, we would have to deduce and give a finding
whether the activity conducted by the assessees herein falls within the nomenclature
of entertainments under Entry 62 – List II thereby recognizing legislative
competence with the State legislature to impose a tax on the assessees herein.
Meaning and Scope of the expression “Luxuries, Entertainments and Amusements” and Legislative
Competence of State Legislatures to impose Entertainment Tax:
Luxuries:
8.6 The expression “entertainments and amusements” finds a place both in Entries
33 as well as 62 – List II. The former is a regulatory entry while the latter is a taxation
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
81
entry. Entry 33 – List II, on the one hand, speaks of theatres and dramatic
performances, while on the other hand, it deals with sports, entertainments and
amusements. Cinemas are also covered within Entry 33 – List II subject to Entry 60
– List I which deals with sanctioning of cinematograph films for exhibition. The
taxation entry (Entry 62 – List II) essentially grants or reserves legislative
competence to the State Legislature to impose taxes on “luxuries” which expression
includes entertainments, amusements, betting and gambling.
Thus, the aforesaid four expressions have been brought under the umbrella of the word “luxuries” so
as to enable a State Legislature to tax these activities. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the
meaning and content of the expression “luxuries, entertainments and amusements”.
8.7 In Express Hotels, this Court observed that luxury connotes extravagance or indulgence as
distinguished from the needs and necessities of life. Taxes on luxuries is not limited to things
tangible and corporeal but the entry encompasses all the manifestations and emanations which
comprehend the elements of extravagance and indulgence that differentiates luxury from necessity.
There can be elements of extravagance or indulgence in the quality of service as well as activities.
8.8 It was observed that luxuries covered both corporeal and incorporeal services and thus refers to
goods and services as noted above. Further, there are two aspects of luxury, the first being objects
and services which are intrinsically capable of fostering a sense of luxury and second, the recipient
of such articles or services who consumes them experiences such gratification. Since “luxuries” can
be both goods and services, what is relevant is the common denominator of the luxury
element/potential of goods and services.
Reference could be made to Oxford English Dictionary, (Second Edition, Volume IX), wherein it is
stated that luxury could among other things be defined as –
(i) abundance, sumptuous enjoyment;
(ii) the habitual use of, or indulgence in, what is choice or costly;
(iii) refined and intense enjoyment; means of luxurious enjoyment;
(iv) in a particularised sense: something which conduces to enjoyment or comfort in addition to
what are accounted as the necessaries. Hence, in recent use, something which is desirable but not
indispensable; and
(v) as an attribute such as luxury coach, cruise duty, edition, flat, liner, shop, tax, trade.
8.9 In short, the connotation of the word luxury is something which conduces enjoyment over and
above the necessities of life to which one takes with a view to enjoy, amuse or entertain oneself. 8.10
In the same vein, in A.B. Abdul Kadir vs. State of Kerala, (1976) 3 SCC 219 (“A.B. Abdul Kadir”), it
was observed that the connotation of the word “luxury” is something which conduces enjoyment
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
82
over and above the necessities of life. It denotes something which is superfluous and not
indispensable and to which one takes with a view to enjoy, amuse or entertain oneself. An
expenditure on something which is in excess of what is required for economic and personal
well-being would be expenditure on luxury although the expenditure is of a nature which is incurred
by a large number of people, including those not economically well off.
8.11 Further, in Godfrey Phillips, it was observed that the expression “luxury” must be understood in
a sense analogous to that of the less general words such as entertainments, amusements, gambling
and betting which are clubbed with it. This is by way of the application of the principle of
interpretation known as noscitur a sociis. Thus, luxuries is also capable of meaning an activity and
has primarily and traditionally been defined as such. It is only derivatively and recently used to
connote an article of luxury. If luxuries is understood as meaning something which is purely for
enjoyment and beyond the necessities of life, then, entertainments, amusements, betting and
gambling would come within its scope and ambit. Further, these are all activities. 8.12 In Western
India Theatres, this Court observed that the ordinary meaning has to be given to the word “luxury”.
This means that it would refer to goods and services which foster “luxury”, a sense of abundance,
enjoyment and gratification. Further taxes on luxuries, entertainments or amusements cannot have
a restricted meaning so as to confine the operation of the law only to taxes on persons receiving the
luxuries, entertainments or amusements. The entry contemplates luxury, entertainments and
amusements as objects on which the tax is to be imposed, if so there can be no reason to
differentiate between the giver and the receiver of the luxuries, entertainments and amusements
and both may, with equal propriety be made amenable to the tax. Thus luxury tax can be imposed on
those who provided it also. It was further observed that the concept of luxuries in the legislative
entry takes within it everything that can fairly and reasonably be said to comprehended in it. The
actual measure of the levy is a matter of legislative policy and convenience so long as the legislation
has a reasonable nexus with the concept of luxuries in the broad and general sense in which the
expressions in legislative list are comprehended, the legislative competent extends to all matters
“with respect to” that field of topic of legislation.
It was further observed that the taxable event need not necessarily be the actual utilization or the
actual consumption, as the case may be, of the luxury. Once the legislative competence and the
nexus between the taxing power and the subject of taxation is established, the other incidence are
matter of fiscal policy behind the taxing law. The measure of the tax is not the same thing as and
must be kept distinguished from the subject of the tax. 8.13 In Federation of Hotel & Restaurant
Association of India, the concept of luxuries in Entry 62 – List II was also considered and in the said
case, the aspect theory was also applied. Entertainments and Amusements:
8.14 According to P. Ramanatha Aiyar’s Advanced Law Lexicon, 6th Edition, Volume
II, the word ‘entertainment’ includes any exhibition, performance, game, sport and
any other form of amusement to which persons are ordinarily admitted on payment.
It also means “work in connection with, or for the purposes of, any cinema, exhibition or
entertainment”. The expression ‘entertainment’ includes hospitality of any kind and also
expenditure on business gift with the aim of advertising to the general public. It is an activity that
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
83
provides amusement and would include public performances including games and sports,
exhibition, amusement to which persons are admitted for payments.
8.15 Readers Digest’s Family Word Finder defines the word “entertainment” to mean amusement,
diversion, distraction, recreation, fun, play, good time, pass time, novelty, pleasure, enjoyment and
satisfaction. Entertainment denotes that which serves for amusement and ‘amusement’ is defined as
a pleasurable occupation of the sense or that which furnishes it as sports or music.
8.16 Webster’s Third New International Dictionary has defined ‘entertainment’ as an act of
diverting, amusing or causing someone’s time to pass agreeably.
8.17 According to Concise Oxford English Dictionary, 11th Edition (Revised) as cited in Bangalore
Turf Club Ltd. vs. Regional Director, ESI Corporation, (2014) 9 SCC 657 (paragraph 43.1),
“entertainment” means ‘the action of providing or being provided with amusement or enjoyment.
An event or performance designed to entertain’.
8.18 In State of Karnataka vs. Drive-in Enterprises, (2001) 4 SCC 60, it was observed that the word
“entertainment” is wide enough to comprehend in it, the luxury or comfort with which a person
entertains himself. It includes viewing a cinema film inside a driving theatre along with a car/motor
vehicle. 8.19 In Purvi Communication, the expression “entertainments” under Entry 62 – List II was
held to include performance, film or programmes shown to the viewers through the cable television
network.
8.20 Thus, the expression “entertainments” is a word of general import and in common parlance, it
includes cinema shows, dramatic performances, etc. The expression ‘entertainments’ used in Entry
62 - List II does not draw a distinction between one who derives amusement and one who caters to
it. It covers both categories.
8.21 This Court has interpreted the expression “entertainments” in a broad and wide manner and
not restricted to entertainment in a public place. With the advancement of technology, there can be
entertainment provided within the private space or the household also by means of television or
other electronic gadgets as well as in a motor vehicle. The growth of technology is such that there is
now entertainment available even on a mobile phone (cell phone or even on a smart watch). Thus,
the expression “entertainments” cannot be interpreted in a narrow, pedantic or in a myopic way.
With the advancement in technology, there can be several modes in which the activity of
entertainment can be provided or received. However, what is essential is the object of providing or
receiving signals etc. which must be for the purpose of entertainment. Amusement:
8.22 The expression “amusement” in Entry 62 – List II would mean diversion, pass
time or enjoyment or a pleasurable occupation of the senses or that which furnished
it vide M.J. Sivani vs. State of Karnataka, AIR 1995 SC 1770. 8.23 Entry 62 - List II is
a specific taxation entry on luxuries, including taxes on entertainments, amusements,
betting and gambling. The expression “entertainments and amusements” would have
to be read ejusdem generis. The tax is thus on the activity of “entertainments and
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
84
amusements” as it is on the activity of betting and gambling. Hence under Entry 62 -
List II, the specific power to tax an activity which is “entertainments and
amusements” is reserved with the State Legislature and cannot be read within the
scope and ambit of Entry 31 - List I which is inherently restricted in its scope to
include “broadcasting and other like forms of communication” (Entry 31 – List I). We
say so for the following reasons:
8.23.1 First, when a specific entry regarding taxation is provided in List II
empowering the State Legislature to levy tax on a subject, namely, “entertainments
and amusements” amongst other similar activities, the same cannot be read by
implication in an entry of List I, namely, Entry 31 - List I which is a regulatory entry.
This is because a taxation entry is separate and distinct from an entry dealing on a
particular subject. This principle has been adequately explained by this Court in
several judgments such as MPV Sundararamier and was followed in Hoechst
Pharmaceuticals as discussed above.
8.23.2 Second, a taxation entry or legislative power to levy a tax on “entertainments
and amusements” in the instant case, cannot be split between Parliament and the
State Legislature when the said power is expressly enumerated in Entry 62 - List II.
This is the constitutional scheme under the three Lists. This is also evident on a
perusal of the entries of List III (Concurrent List) which empowers both the Union as
well as State Legislature to enact laws on subjects mentioned therein and the power
to levy a tax is conspicuous by its absence.
8.23.3 Third, the object and purpose of Entry 62 - List II is to tax the activity of
“entertainments and amusements”.
8.23.4 Fourth, theatres and dramatic performances, cinemas, sports, entertainments
and amusements are subjects enumerated in Entry 33 - List II and are State subjects,
therefore, regulation of such activities within a State is complemented by the power
of the State legislature to also tax the said activity under Entry 62 – List II. This is
because what is being taxed is an entertainment and amusement activity which is
squarely covered under Entry 62 -
List II. Therefore, the State legislature has the competence to tax the activities enumerated in Entry
33 - List II. 8.23.5 Fifth, the contention of the assessees that the subject being placed in Entry 31 -
List I would also empower only Parliament to impose a tax on the same by way of implication under
the said entry itself is not a correct interpretation of the entries in the Lists.
8.23.6 Sixth, Entry 97 - List I can be invoked only when any matter is not enumerated in List II or
List III including any tax not mentioned in the said Lists. There is no specific entry for levy of tax on
entertainments and amusements in List I. It is only in Entry 62 - List II. Thus, Entry 62 - List II
gives legislative competence to a State Legislature to levy a tax on, inter alia, “entertainments and
amusements”. This would also include a tax on organisation and conduct of entertainments and
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
85
amusements within the State when permission has been given by a State Government to conduct
such an activity of entertainments and amusements in whatever form it may be. Thus, Entries 33
and 62 of List – II which, inter alia, deal with “entertainments and amusements” have to be
interpreted identically and the expressions given an identical meaning. 8.23.7 Seventh, when the
State Government has the legislative competence to levy a tax on, inter alia, entertainments and
amusements (as a specific taxation entry is provided to levy tax on the said activity under Entry 62 -
List II), the said entry must be interpreted comprehensively and not in a restricted or narrow
manner by excluding from the purview of the said entry, taxation on entertainments and
amusements conducted through television by the medium of broadcasting.
8.23.8 Eighth, such a power to levy taxes on entertainments and amusements cannot be read into
Entry 31 - List I by implication or into Entry 97 - List I as a residuary power. Such interpretation, if
endorsed, would do violence to the manner of interpretation of entries in the Lists and prove to be
contrary to the Articles of the Constitution and judgments of this Court cited above.
8.23.9 Ninth, if the State Government permits any species of entertainments or amusements activity
within the State in terms of Entry 33 - List II, then the State also has legislative competence to tax
such an activity as per Entry 62 - List II. 8.23.10 Tenth, Entry 31 - List I is meant only for the
purpose of regulation. The said entry cannot be expanded to cover the power to levy taxes on
entertainments and amusements by Parliament when such a power is envisaged in Entry 62 - List II.
Parliament, therefore, cannot tax an entertainment or amusement activity, on the strength of Entry
31 - List I. It may however regulate the said activity to the extent permissible under Entry 31 – List I.
Any impost strictly for the purpose of regulation of broadcasting is permissible so long as it is not a
tax on entertainment or amusement which is only within the ambit of only Entry 62 - List II.
8.23.11 Eleventh, any entertainment or amusement activity conducted by a private entity in a State
or authorised by a State Government can be regulated only by the State Legislature. This is because
Entry 33 - List II which deals with, inter alia, entertainments and amusements, also includes
television entertainment. The regulation could be of Cable Television operators in the State.
8.24 The definition of broadcasting in Section 65(13) of the Finance Act, 1994 as amended in 2001 is
as per the meaning assigned to it in clause (c) of Section 2 of the Prasar Bharti Act, 1990. The said
Act is made pursuant to Entry 31 – List I which deals with posts and telegraphs; telephones,
wireless, broadcasting and other like forms of communications. The quintessence of Entry 31 – List
I is communication which could be through various modes as referred to above. However, Entry 62
– List II deals with taxes on luxuries which is a totally distinct entry as opposed to communication
which is the subject-matter of Entry 31 – List I and within the nomenclature of the expression
“luxury”, is included inter alia entertainments and amusements.
8.24.1 Therefore, on a plain reading of the said entries, it is very apparent that broadcasting is a
form of communication and entertainment is a species of luxuries under Entry 62 – List II. There is
no doubt that there are various modes of entertainments. Geeta Enterprises is a case which is
restricted to certain modes of entertainments but with the advancement of technology, we have
noted that entertainment could be through television and other digital devices including cell phone
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
86
or smart phone. The expression “entertainments” in whatever mode it may be, come within the
nomenclature or genre of luxuries which totally distinct from the expression “communication”. It
may be that the activity of entertainment is achieved through communication and in that sense
could be through the mode of broadcasting and in that sense, broadcasting and communication is
for the purpose of the entertainment. Hence, in our view, the State Legislature were fully justified in
imposing entertainment tax under Entry 62 – List II. That broad casting through T.V. cable network
and cable operators is for carrying out the activity of entertainment and in pith and substance falls
within the scope and ambit of Entry 62 – List II. However, the means adopted is through
broadcasting which is a means of communication under Entry 31 – List I and therefore incidentally
touches upon the subject under Entry 31 – List I. 8.24.2 Insofar as the argument that broadcasting
falls only within the scope and ambit of Entry 31 – List I is concerned, it has to be viewed only as a
form of communication and for the purpose of imposition of service tax, broadcasting is given
meaning which is attributed to clause (c) of Section 2 of the Prasar Bharti Act, 1990 which as already
noted as a regulatory entry. A regulatory entry cannot be a basis for imposition of a tax as this Court
way back in MPV Sundararamier expressed. That a taxation entry is exclusive and de hors a
regulatory entry and cannot be read by way of an implication into a regulatory entry. That apart, in
H.S. Dhillon, this Court has specifically stated that if a tax falls within the scope and ambit of an
entry in a particular list then the same cannot be read into the residuary list, namely, Entry 97 – List
I. In the circumstances, we find that the borrowing of the definition “broadcasting” from the Prasar
Bharti Act, 1990 for the purpose of imposition of service tax on a broadcaster and thereby including
a person who is in the entertainment industry to also liable to pay service tax, is not a levy in the
nature of entertainment tax. Thus, a levy of service tax on a broadcaster is not a levy on an activity
which is in the realm of entertainment. Conversely, a levy of entertainment tax by a State under
Enter 62 – List II is not a levy on the activity/service of broadcasting but on the activity of providing
and receiving entertainment.
8.25 In conclusion we hold that the tax sought to be imposed by the State Legislatures by way of the
impugned Acts, is traceable to the power conferred on the State Legislatures under Entry 62 - List
II. The said entry contemplates imposition of taxes, inter alia, on the entire genus of
“entertainments and amusements”. The pith and substance of the provisions of the State Act
referred to above are in the realm of taxation of providers/receivers of entertainment/amusement as
luxuries within the said Entry through the medium of television which involves broadcasting service
which is regulated under Entry 31 – List I as a form of communication in accordance with Prasar
Bharti Act, 1990. Parameters of Taxation:
8.26 A legislative enactment which provides for the imposition of a tax must specify
the following parameters of taxation:
(i) The taxable event which forms the basis of levy, also referred to as “subject” of a
tax;
(ii) The measure of the tax;
(iii) The rate(s) of taxation; and
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
87
(iv) The incidence of the tax.
8.27 The said parameters are each distinct and must not be conflated with the others. The
components of tax, as stated above have been characterised in Govind Saran Ganga Saran. In the
said case, it was also laid down that a legislative scheme which seeks to impose a tax, ought to define
each of the aforestated components with certainty and precision. The observations of Pathak, C.J. in
the aforesaid case can be extracted as under : (SCC pp. 209-10, para 6) “6. The components which
enter into the concept of a tax are well known. The first is the character of the imposition known by
its nature which prescribes the taxable event attracting the levy, the second is a clear indication of
the person on whom the levy is imposed and who is obliged to pay the tax, the third is the rate at
which the tax is imposed, and the fourth is the measure or value to which the rate will be applied for
computing the tax liability. If those components are not clearly and definitely ascertainable, it is
difficult to say that the levy exists in point of law. Any uncertainty or vagueness in the legislative
scheme defining any of those components of the levy will be fatal to its validity.” 8.28 This Court, in
State of Karnataka, applied the aforesaid parameters of taxation in the context of the State
enactments for collection of tax on conduct of lotteries that is encompassing the activity of betting
and gambling. Paragraphs 111.1 – 111.4 are apposite to the present case and they read as under:
“111.1. In the context of the tax sought to be imposed by the impugned Acts, the basis
of levy is the conduct of lotteries within the State of Karnataka or Kerala. In other
words, the subject of taxation is the conduct of lottery schemes, by the Government of
India or the Government of other States, within the State of Kerala or Karnataka.
While it has rightly been stated by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
respondents that the conduct of lotteries involves a host of events such as
formulation and notification of scheme of lotteries, printing, transportation and sale
of lottery tickets, etc. all these events constituting the conduct of the lotteries are
ultimately for the participation of persons, within the State of Karnataka or Kerala.
Therefore, the subject of tax is the conduct of lottery schemes, within the State of
Karnataka or Kerala, which is enabled by the propensity of persons to participate in
the lottery schemes.
111.2. The measure of taxation in the instant case is the “draw”. The impugned
legislations contemplate two kinds of draws, namely, bumper draw and draw other
than a bumper draw.
111.3. The rate of tax, is a dependent variable and is to be determined based on the
measure. In the instant case, the rate of tax under the Karnataka Act, 2005 is Rupees
one lakh and fifty thousand in respect of a bumper draw and Rupees one lakh in
respect of any other draw.
Similarly, in the Kerala Act, 2005, the rate of tax is Rupees ten lakhs in respect of a bumper draw
and Rupees two lakhs and fifty thousand in respect of any other draw. 111.4. The incidence of the tax
is on the promoters of the lotteries i.e. on the Government of India or a the Government of a State or
a Union Territory or any country organising, conducting or promoting a lottery, within the State of
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025

88
Karnataka or Kerala, or any person or entity appointed by the said Government or country in this
behalf. The impugned Acts require registration of promoters and all provisions requiring filing of
the returns of draws and payment of tax, are to operate in relation to promoters. Therefore, the
incidence of the tax, falls on the promoters of the lotteries.” 8.29 The above analogy be applied in
the context of the legislative enactments of the States under consideration and the following table
would bring out the aforesaid parameters of taxation in the context of the activity of providing and
receiving entertainment:

8.30    The parameters of taxation when juxtaposed with the
relevant provisions of the State Acts under consideration, it is evident that the
parameters of taxation can be clearly discerned from the aforesaid provision of the
State Acts all relatable to the subject “entertainment” on which the tax is levied
coming within scope and ambit of Entry 62 – List II.
Relevant case law:
Suresh:
9. The judgment of this Court in Suresh is relevant to the issues herein and deserves deliberation.
Suresh arose from an appeal against the judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Madras in
Tamil Nadu Cable TV Organisers Association vs. Government of Tamil Nadu, W.P. No.10013/1994
dt. 30.11.1994 (“Tamil Nadu Cable TV Organisers Association”). In the aforesaid case, the
constitutional validity of sub-sections (2A), (2-B), (11) of section 3 and section 4-E of the Tamil
Nadu Entertainments Tax Act, 1939 as amended by Act 37 of 1994 (“1994 Act”) with the relevant
Rules in G.O.P. No.265 dt. 18.08.1994 was under challenge. The purpose of the 1994 Act was to levy
entertainment tax on exhibition of films or moving pictures or series of pictures through cable
television.
“Cable television” was defined in clause (2-B) of section 3 as follows:
““cable television” means a system organised for television exhibition by using a
video cassette or disc or both, recorder or player of similar such apparatus on which
pre- recorded video cassettes or discs or both are played or replayed and the films or
moving pictures or series of pictures which are viewed and heard on the television
receiving set at a residential or non-residential place of a connection holder.”
“Television exhibition” was defined in clause (11) of section 3 as follows:
““television exhibition” means an exhibition with the aid of any type of antenna with
a cable network attached to it or cable television, of a film, or moving picture or series
of moving pictures, by means of transmission of television signals by wire where
subscribers’ television sets at residential or non-residential place are linked by
metallic coaxial cable or optic fibre cable to a central system called the head-end.”
Section 4E is the charging section which was introduced for the first time as follows:
“(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in sections 4 and 7, there shall be levied and
paid to the State Government a tax (hereinafter referred to as the entertainments tax)
calculated at forty per cent of the amount collected by way of contribution or
subscription or installation or connection charges or any other charges collected in
any manner whatsoever for television exhibition.
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
90
(2) The tax levied under sub-section (1) shall be recoverable from the proprietor.
(3) The provisions of this Act (other than Sections 4, 4B, 4D, 5, 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E,
5F, 5G, 6(1), 7 and 13) and the rules made thereunder shall, so far as may be, apply in
relation to the tax payable under sub-section (1).” 9.1 It is relevant here to list the
major issues of the writ petitioners therein. They are as follows:
I. The State Legislature has no competence to pass the impugned Act inasmuch as the
subject falls entirely within List I of Schedule VII to the Constitution.
II. The Union of India has passed a legislation viz., Cable Television Network
(Regulation) Ordinance 9 of 1994 and also framed the Cable Television Rules of 1994.
Thus, by the doctrine of “occupied field”, the State Legislature has no power to pass
the impugned Act.
III. The impugned Act violates the provisions of Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of
India, as it operates as an unreasonable restriction on the freedom of speech and
expression of the citizens of this country.
IV. The tax levied by the Amendment Act is not a ‘tax on entertainment’ even as
defined by the Act. It is a colourable legislation and is a fraud on the legislative
powers for the following reasons:
a. Installation Charges and connection charges paid by the viewer cannot form part of
the charges for entertainment.
b. In effect, it is a tax on trade, profession or calling, falling within the scope of Entry
60 - List II read with Article 276 of the Constitution of India.
c. The transmission through the Cable Television Network is not only of films or
moving pictures but also of several educative programmes. In effect, it is partly a tax
on education. The entertainment part of the transmission will be less than 10% of the
total transmission. As there is no provision for apportionment of the tax on
entertainment and on other non-entertainment programmes, the entire levy is illegal
and invalid.
d. There is no nexus between the object of the legislation and the provision contained
in the Act, and therefore, it is unconstitutional.
V. The provisions of the Act violates Article 14 of the Constitution of India for the
following reasons:
a. It does not impose a tax on Door darshan and those who own a disc antenna
including posh hotels and other organisations.
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
91
b. The Act treats unequals as equals inasmuch as the levy is the same with reference
to rural operators as well as urban operators.
VI. Essentially, the tax levied by the impugned Act is one on private enjoyment by the
people in their respective houses and not on public entertainment.
VII. The provisions of the Act are unreasonable due to the following reasons.
a. The rate of tax is unduly exorbitant and wholly unreasonable so as to practically
annihilate the business of the Cable TV Operators.
b. The provision for security deposit of Rs. 10,000 under Rule 21C is an unreasonable
restriction on the business.
c. The provision for inspection of the place from where such television exhibition is
provided, under Section 11 of the Act is unwarranted and an unreasonable restriction
on the business.
9.2 As regards Issue I questioning the legislative competence, petitioners therein
argued that the subject matter was governed by Entry 31 and Entry 60 - List I or
alternatively, it would fall under the residuary Entry 97 - List I as it was a matter not
enumerated in List II or List III of the Seventh Schedule. It was also argued that the
Act defined “entertainment” to mean “a horse-race or cinematograph exhibition to
which persons are admitted on payment” and this definition had been holding the
field since 1939 and therefore the expression ‘entertainment’ was a nomen juris for “a
horse-race or cinematograph exhibition”.
9.3 However, the High Court opined that modern statutes have to be interpreted
under new facts and situations and that old meaning cannot be given to the
expression used therein by relying on the maxim contemporanea expositio est optima
et fortissima in lege (contemporaneous exposition is the best and strongest in law).
It then opined that the Indian Constitution has always been held to be an organic instrument and
the expressions used in the Constitution cannot be restricted to the facts and circumstances which
prevailed at the time of the passing of the Constitution. By relying on cases such as Geeta
Enterprises and Express Hotels, the High Court held that the meaning of the word ‘entertainments’
used in Entry 62 - List II is not confined to the definition of the said word as found in the Madras
Entertainments Tax Act, 1939 and that the impugned Act falls within Entry 62 - List II. 9.4 With
regard to Issue II dealing with repugnancy and occupied field, the Court rejected the argument of
petitioners that the impugned Act is repugnant to the provisions of the Central Ordinance 9 of 1994
since it had found that the subject-matter fell within Entry 62 - List II.
9.5 On the contention regarding violation of Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, the Court also
rejected the argument that the taxation curtails the freedom of expression of the various national
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
92
and international television operators by holding that the Cable TV Operators are not prevented
from expressing their views on any particular matter.
9.6 As regards Issue IV(a), petitioners contended that the charges for installation or connection are
only for the purpose of laying own connecting wires and cables which will not be a recurring
expenditure and they cannot be termed as charges paid for the enjoyment of entertainment. The
High Court rejected this contention, noting that whatever amount was paid by the viewer to the
Cable TV Operator for installation or connection or for transmission of different programmes, all
that was intended as payment for enjoying the entertainment. It also decided Issue IV(b) in favour
of the State noting that the incidence of tax was on entertainment as such and not on any individual.
As regards Issue IV(c), the Court rejected the contention of the petitioners that the tax was mostly
on non-entertainment programmes which were of high educational value, and since it was not
possible to apportion the tax between entertainment programmes and non- entertainment
programmes, the entire levy had to be struck down as unconstitutional. It held that if the pith and
substance of the Act brought an enactment within the scope of a particular legislative entry, it could
neither be dissected into different parts nor could it be held that the major part of it fell outside the
scope of the entry. It rejected the contention of the petitioner as regards Issue IV(d) at the very
outset.
9.7 Issue V dealt with Article 14 and the Court reiterated the principles of law relating to
classification in a fiscal enactment that the legislature has wide latitude in such matters. It noted
that the classification was based on intelligible differentia having nexus with the object of the
enactment and that there was no hostile discrimination whatsoever against Cable TV operators. As
regards the urban/rural classification, the Court noted that merely because the operators in rural
areas may not get as many customers as the operators get in urban areas, it cannot be a ground to
provide differential rates, as the incidence of tax was on entertainment and it was the same whether
the viewer was in a village or a town or a city.
9.8 Issue VI invoked a right to privacy argument. According to the petitioners, due to the imposition
of tax, the charges for getting such connections became out of reach for ordinary people and hence
were deprived of watching programmes on the television in the privacy of their respective abodes.
The Court dismissed this contention as far-fetched. It also noted that the tax was imposed only on
the proprietor, and the law does not mandate that the same be passed on to consumers.
9.9 With regard to Issue VII, the Court reiterated the well- settled principle that it has no concern
with the wisdom of the legislature in prescribing the rate of tax. It opined that when there was no
prohibition in the Act against the proprietor passing on the tax liability to the customers, there was
nothing wrong in the taxing enactment to prescribe the furnishing of security for the proper
payment of tax. It also held as regards provisions for inspection that the Legislature was always
entitled to make provisions to enable the proper enforcement of the levy. Holding so, it dismissed all
the petitions.
9.10 The Supreme Court in Suresh upheld this decision of the Madras High Court. It felt
unnecessary to deal with all its conclusions except the submissions relating to i) freedom of speech
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
93
and expression; ii) colourable legislation; and iii) the rate of tax. It noted that the activity of the
appellants therein was a combination of two rights i.e. business and speech – sub-clause (g) and (a)
of clause (1) of Article 19 and that there was no reason why the business part of it could not be taxed.
It also noted that the State had duly explained its reasons for imposing tax at the rate of 40% and
that since the appellants also carried on business, it was their duty to share the burden of the State
by paying taxes like any other business.
Vasant Madhav Patwardhan:
9.11 A similar matter had come up before the Bombay High Court in Vasant Madhav
Patwardhan vs. State of Maharashtra, 2000 SCC OnLine Bom 244 wherein operators
of Cable Television filed a writ under Article 226 of the Constitution challenging the
constitutional validity of an amendment to the Bombay Entertainments Duty Act,
1923. The said Act imposed a tax on the entertainment provided by the Cable TV
network. 9.12 The Bombay HC discussed Tamil Nadu Cable TV Organisers
Association and Suresh in detail. It noted that the judgments above substantially
covered the scope and controversy raised before it and that the substance of the
legislations both in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu were markedly similar. It noted
that the Constitution is an organic document and that the vision of the founding
fathers cannot, by a process of artificial construction, be frozen at the scientific
knowledge and technology which was available at the point of time when the
Constitution was drafted.
Consequently, it upheld the competence of the State to levy the tax. An appeal against this judgment
before the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No. 7167 of 2000 was dismissed on the ground that the
“point involved in this appeal is squarely covered by the judgment of this Court in Suresh”.
Geeta Enterprises vs. Purvi Communication:
10. During the course of the arguments, learned senior counsel Sri KK Venugopal submitted that the
three Judge Bench judgment of this Court in Purvi Communication is per incuriam as it did not
follow the reasoning of the coordinate Bench judgment in Geeta Enterprises and therefore, the
correctness of Purvi Communication must be examined by a larger Bench of five judges.
10.1 While the three judge bench in Geeta Enterprises held that the levy of entertainment tax
necessitates that the entertainment in question have a public colour, the coordinate bench deciding
Purvi Communication did not take note of the same and erred in holding that state legislatures are
competent to impose entertainment tax under Entry 62 – List II on the services rendered by Cable
TV Operators. In that regard, Sri Venugopal placed reliance on the judgment of the Constitution
Bench of this Court in State of M.P. vs. Abha Sethi, (1999) 4 SCC 32 wherein Geeta Enterprises was
cited with approval and its correctness affirmed. 10.2 Learned senior counsel further argued that the
1979 Act was amended in 2009 to introduce entertainment tax on DTH services. Our attention was
drawn to the charging section of the 1979 Act i.e. Section 3, which, according to Sri Venugopal,
predicates the levy of entertainment tax upon “admission to an entertainment”. It was argued that
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
94
watching television within the boundaries of one’s home cannot be considered “admission to an
entertainment”. Therefore, it was contended that the charging section does not apply to the activity
of the assessees herein. Placing reliance on Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, it was further argued
that the dominant nature of the activity of the assessees is that of broadcasting and this Court must
be circumspect in holding otherwise.
10.3 The crux of the submission was that in Geeta Enterprises, the word ‘entertainment’, as used in
section 2(3) of the Uttar Pradesh Entertainment and Betting Tax Act, 1937 impugned therein, was
interpreted to require a ‘public colour’. He submitted that such an interpretation was in line with the
meaning of the word ‘entertainments’ in Entry 62 - List II, which has historically required a ‘public
colour’. The relevant paragraphs in Geeta Enterprises are as follows (p.818):
“Thus, on a consideration of the legal connotation of the word entertainment as
defined in various books, and other circumstances of the case as also on a true
interpretation of the word as defined in s. 2 (3) of the Act, it follows that the show
must pass the following tests to fall within the ambit of the aforesaid section :
1. that the show, performance, game or sport, etc. must contain a public colour in that
the show should be open to public in a hall, theatre or any other place where
members of the public are invited or attend the show.
2. …” (emphasis supplied) 10.4 Sri Venugopal, learned senior counsel submitted that
Purvi Communication ignored this requirement of ‘public colour’ and proceeded to
hold that the performance, film or programme shown to the viewers through the
cable television network came within the meaning of ‘entertainments’ under Entry 62
- List II to make law for the levy and collection of tax on such entertainments.
10.5 Sri Shisodia, learned senior counsel, on the other hand submitted that, as
regards the question of whether cable TV operators may be taxed under the
impugned Act when it is the subscribers who spend on entertainment, the judgment
of this Court in Purvi Communication squarely covers it. Therein, this Court held
that, “37. In our view, the respondents as a cable operator, for the purpose of levy and
collection of tax under Sub-section (4a) of Section 4A of the Act have direct and close
nexus with the entertainments made available to the viewer through their cable
television network. The performance, film or programmes shown to the viewers
through the cable television network come within the meaning of entertainments and
therefore within the legislative competence of the State Legislature under Entry 62 of
List II of Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India to make law for the levy and
collection of tax on such entertainments.
38. A tax under Entry 62 of List II of Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India may be imposed
not only on the person spending on entertainment but also on the act of a person entertaining, or
the subject of entertainment. It is well settled by this Court that such tax may be levied on the
person offering or providing entertainment or the person enjoying it.
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/

39. In the tax matters, the State Legislature is free to, if it has legislative competence, to choose the
persons from whom the tax levied on entertainments is to be collected. In other words, what are
taxed are the entertainments, which is very much within the ambit of Entry 62 of List II of Seventy
Schedule.” (emphasis supplied) 10.6 We are of the view that Purvi Communication is not per
incuriam and need not be referred to a larger Bench. To substantiate our reasons, let us revisit Geeta
Enterprises and Purvi Communication in light of Entry 62 - List II. 10.7 In Geeta Enterprises, the
petitioner therein permitted persons to enter the premises without any charge to view a show on the
video which consisted mainly of sports, games etc. played on the screen of the video. Electronic
machines were imported from Japan and the mechanism for playing the machine was so designed
that a coin of fifty paise was to be inserted into a strong box built within the machine, the keys of
which was with the manufacturer. After the show was over, a representative of the manufacturing
company would come, open the box collect the money and pay the share of the hire-petitioner
therein out of the collected sale proceeds. The charge of inserting the coin was released only from
those who wanted to operate the video machine at the rate of fifty paise for a show lasting up to
thirty seconds. 10.8 In Geeta Enterprises, the applicability of entertainment tax on the video game
installed by the petitioner therein was under
question. The modus operandi was that a machine with a video screen was installed
in the parlour of the petitioner. There was no admission fee for people to enter the
parlour, but a coin of 50 naya paise was to be inserted into a strong box built within
the machine to play the video game. The question was, whether this modus operandi
would fall within the interpretation of the word "Entertainment" as used in section
2(3) of the Uttar Pradesh Entertainment and Betting Tax Act, 1937 (hereinafter
referred to as ‘the 1937 Act). Section 2(3) of the 1937 Act provided that:
"entertainment" includes any exhibitional, performance, amusement, game or short
to which persons are admitted for payment."
10.8.1 This Court went into the different meanings of ‘entertainment’ to arrive at a conclusion that it
has been used in a very wide sense to include within its ambit, entertainment of any kind including
one which may be purely educative. It rejected the contention of the petitioner therein that video
games do not fall into the definition as no admission fee was charged from the viewers. It held that
(at p.817), “…when a number of people without any admission fee enter a hall for entertainment and
enjoy the games it becomes a public show and the hall where the video is played becomes a public
hall and· amounts therefore to a public exhibition which is squarely covered by the first limb
(exhibitional) of the definition of entertainment in Sub-section 3 extracted above.” (emphasis
supplied) 10.8.2 Finally, the Court affirmed the views of the Allahabad High Court in Gopal Krishna
Agarwal vs. State of Uttar Pradesh, (1982) All. L.J. 607 which held that entertainment tax was
leviable on video games. It approved the High Court’s reasoning that, “With the advance of
civilization ·and scientific developments new forms of entertainment have come into existence.
Video Games are probably the latest additions to the means of entertainment. These games require
skill and precision as so many other games do. They are a source of amusement and enjoyment to
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
96
those who participate in the games. Others who stand by and watch also derive some pleasure and
amusement though not to the same degree. Admission to the premises where the Video Machines
are installed may be free but payment is admittedly made if one wants to play the game. The money
charged for use of the Video Machine is an admission to entertainment and the payment made by
the person who uses the Machine is the payment for admission. In any case it is a payment for
admission.” Section 3 of the 1937 Act, i.e. the charging section imposed tax on all payment for
admission to any entertainment (entertainment tax). The question was, whether or not the aforesaid
show would fall within the four corners of the expression “entertainment” which was defined to
include any exhibitional, performance, amusement, game or sport to which persons are admitted for
payment under the said statute. Having regard to the aforesaid definition and bearing in mind the
varying definitions of the expression entertainment, it was observed that Section 2(3) of the said Act
required certain tests to be applied in order to ascertain whether the activity fell within the aforesaid
section. It was in the context of the definition of the expression entertainment in the Act under
consideration therein that this Court laid down the test. Ultimately, this Court observed that the
video show in the instant case was exigible to tax under Section 3 of the Act considered therein and
the Writ Petitions filed were dismissed. This decision pertains to the period prior to the ushering of
television in the country.
10.8.3 On a reading of this judgment, it becomes clear that the interpretation of the word
‘entertainments’ includes newer forms of entertainment such as video games, while at the same time
it viewed entertainment to have a public character. 10.9 Let us now consider Purvi Communication.
In this case, the respondent therein was carrying on business as a multi-system operator (MSO) and
engaged in receiving and providing TV signals to individual cable operators of various localities.
Communication signals known as TV signals broadcasted by various satellite channels were received
and distributed to sub-cable operators. The process involved in the business consisted of
establishment of the state-of-the-art control rooms and spreading the cable networks. The said
network signals were being given to various sub-cable operators with whom the respondents had
franchise agreement. According to the respondents therein, the object of the MSOs was to capture
signals from various satellites and to put all of them in proper format/frequencies so that all those
signals can travel together in cables without encroaching upon and interfering with other signals for
the reception and distribution by the so-called cable operators. The signals are transmitted through
the satellites by the various broadcasters from their earth up-linking stations in various parts of the
world.
Respondent No.1 therein entered into franchise agreement with the individual cable operator of
various localities and on the basis of the said agreement, it transmitted the said signals to the said
individual sub-cable operators against a price. The individual sub-cable operators on the basis of the
monthly subscription provided the said TV signals to the individual subscribers of the locality.
10.9.1 The State of West Bengal sought to impose a tax on MSOs engaged in receiving and providing
television signals to individual cable operators of various localities by amending the West Bengal
Entertainment-cum-Amusement Tax Act, 1982 (“the 1982 Act”). Some of the relevant definitions
under the Act were with regard to the expressions “cable operators”, “sub-cable operators”, “cable
service”, “cable television network”, “subscriber” and “gross receipt”. The said Act was amended in
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
97
1998 by omitting sub-section (4) of Section 4A and inserting a new sub-section (4a) which provided
that, “(4a) Where any owner, or any person for the time being in possession, of any electrical,
electronic or mechanical device, is a cable operator and receives through such device the signal of
any performance, film or any other programme telecast, and thereafter such owner or person,
against payment received or receivable,-
i. exhibits such performance, film or programme through cable television network directly to
customers, or ii. transmits such signal to a sub-cable operator, who in turn provides cable service for
exhibition of such performance, film or programme to the customers, such owner or person shall be
liable to pay tax from the month in which he exhibits such performance, film or programme or
transmits such signal to a sub-cable operator on the basis of his monthly gross receipt at such rate,
not exceeding twenty five per centum of the monthly gross receipt, as may be specified by the State
Government by notification published in the Official Gazette.” 10.9.2 Aggrieved by the imposition of
entertainment tax and the demand notices issued, the respondents therein challenged the vires of
the 1998 Amendment made to the 1982 Act as well as the demand notices before the Taxation
Tribunal and being aggrieved by its decision approached the High Court under Article 226 of the
Constitution.
10.9.3 It was contended on behalf of the sub-cable operators that they were not providing any
entertainment within the meaning of Entry 62 – List II as providing the cable link up to the viewers
was the only role. That the sub-cable operator was merely transmitting the signals received by the
cable operator which were in the form of audio-video signal. Per contra, the State of West Bengal in
the said case submitted that the cable operators were engaged in receiving and providing TV signals
to individual sub- cable operators of various localities and such cable operators on their part
transmit the signals to their respective subscribers, who are the actual consumers who get the
benefit of the entertainment from the signals. That the signals received by the sub-cable operators
are utilized for providing information and entertainment to their customers. That respondent No.1
before this Court was a cable operator and the MSOs like the respondent company were not only
providing the input to the localized cable operators in their business of providing cable TV
connections and transmission or programme through cables but the MSOs were also concerned with
value added services like internet, telephone and transmission of data. It was argued that the
respondent therein did not carry on any activity which constituted entertainment or amusement.
That the MSOs were different from sub-cable operators. It was contended that a cable operator in a
locality who is actually providing the entertainment to his subscribers may be liable to pay tax but
those who function at an intermediary stage cannot be held liable to pay the said tax.
10.9.4 It was further submitted that the taxable event, namely, the act or activity of entertainment
must have a direct and proximate connection with the assessee on which it falls and must itself
constitute entertainment. That unless an activity in question qualifies as entertainment itself, the
taxable event of entertainment cannot arise. If the activity in question is not the taxable event
(entertainment), the levy cannot be sustained. 10.9.5 The High Court of Calcutta allowed the writ
petition filed by the MSO and declared section 4A(4a) of the 1982 Act as ultra vires the Constitution.

10.9.6 On appeal by the State, the MSO submitted that they merely capture signals from various
satellites and put all of them in proper format/frequencies for the reception and distribution by the
sub-cable operators. However, the Court allowed the appeal by the State. While considering Section
4-A (4-a) of the State Act, it was observed that the purpose of the said provision was to levy and
collection of the tax from any person who provides cable service directly to consumers or transmits
to a sub-cable operators through a cable television network and otherwise controls or is responsible
for the management and operation of a cable television network and such person has been defined
as cable operator being a taxable person exclusively for the purpose of levy and collection of
entertainment tax. Only when a cable operator so defined receives through any electrical, electronic
and mechanical device, the signal of any performance, film or any other programme telecast and
provides cable service directly to consumers or transmits signals to a sub-cable operator through a
cable television network and otherwise controls or is responsible for the management and operation
of cable television network, he would be liable. Therefore, a cable operator is the source of
entertainment to the individual subscribers because, it is he who receives the signal of performance,
film, and any programme which is transmitted or given to a large number of sub-cable operators
(although they call them as cable operator). The viewers enjoy, or are entertained by such
performance, film, or programme because of receiving and transmitting video or audio-visual
signals through coaxial cable or any other device by the respondents. No entertainment can be
presented to the viewers unless a cable operator transmits the video and audio signals to a sub-cable
operator for instantaneous presentation of any performance, film or any programme on their TV
screen. The sub-cable operators are mere franchisees who receive signals for transmission to the
viewers only on payment of a price promised or paid in terms of agreements entered by and between
them. Therefore, the respondents as a cable operator have direct and proximate nexus with the
entertainment provided by them through their cable television network and as such, they are the
taxable person in respect of their gross receipts in relation to any month for providing
entertainments to the individual viewers. This Court observed that the respondents therein as cable
operators for the purpose of levy and collection of tax had direct and close nexus with the
entertainments made available to the viewer through their cable television network. The
performance, film or programmes shown to the viewers through the cable television network come
within the meaning of entertainments and therefore within the legislative competence of the State
Legislature under Entry 62 - List II to make law for the levy and collection of tax on such
entertainments. This Court further observed in paragraphs 38 and 39 is as under:
“38. A tax under Entry 62 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution may
be imposed not only on the person spending on entertainment but also on the act of a
person entertaining, or the subject of entertainment. It is well settled by this Court
that such tax may be levied on the person offering or providing entertainment or the
person enjoying it. The respondents are admittedly engaged in the business of
receiving broadcast signals and then instantaneously sending or transmitting such
visual or audio-visual signals by coaxial cable, to subscribers' homes through their
various franchisees. It has been made possible for the individual subscribers to
choose the desired channels on their individual TV sets because of cable television
technology of the respondents and of sending the visual or audio-visual signals to
sub-cable operators, and instantly retransmitting such signals to individual
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
99
subscribers for entertaining them through their franchisees. The respondents' act is,
no doubt, an act of offering entertainment to the subscribers and/or viewers. The
respondent is very much directly and closely involved in the act of offering or
providing entertainment to subscribers who are on his record. For the fact of offering
or providing entertainment to the subscribers and/or viewers, the respondents
receive charges, which are realised or collected by their franchisee from the ultimate
subscribers. Their franchisee, called as sub-cable operator under the said 1982 Act
having no independent role to offer or provide entertainments to the subscribers
inasmuch as franchisees have to depend entirely on the respondents' communication
network and this communication network of the respondents consists of receiving
and sending visual images and audio and other information for preparation of the
subscribers and/or viewers; without the communication network service of the
respondents, no entertainments can be offered or provided to the subscribers and/or
viewers.
39. In the tax matters, the State Legislature is free, if it has legislative competence, to
choose the persons from whom the tax levied on entertainments is to be collected. In
other words, what are taxed are the entertainments, which is very much within the
ambit of Entry 62 of List II of the Seventh Schedule. It is the respondents who as
cable operator for the purpose of the said 1982 Act are engaged in the business of
providing or offering entertainments which include showing of films, various serials,
cricket matches and dramatic performances to the subscribers, and the tax is
imposed on the act of offering such entertainments in this way to such subscribers
and/or viewers. The entire communication network service is built up and controlled
by the respondents. Whatever amount is received or receivable by the respondent in
respect of providing such entertainments is taxable under sub-
section (4-a) of Section 4-A of the said 1982 Act which has a direct and sufficient nexus with the
entertainments.” 10.9.7 It is thus clear that the cable operator, respondent No. 1 is the exhibitor in
this case and also the provider of the entertainment to the customer. Hence, he alone can be asked
to pay the tax on the entertainment that has resulted from this exhibition. This provision, therefore,
does not cross the bounds of Entry 62 - List II and is intra vires. Providing a cable link up to the
viewers' end is the only role of sub-cable operator. It is, therefore, inconceivable that despite putting
forth the ready entertainment in the form of signal on the cable line, the cable operator cannot be
said to be providing the entertainment within the meaning of Entry 62 - List II. So long as the State
Act remains within the ambit of Entry 62 - List II and is not offending the provisions of Article 286
of the Constitution or the laws made thereunder, the State Act's validity is beyond question.
10.9.8 This Court further observed that in the said case, respondent No.1 therein sends visual
images and audio signals for presentation to the individual subscribers in their homes through their
feeder line i.e. coaxial cable or any other device used for transmitting audio and visual signals in
terms of clause (2) of the said agreement. The franchisee has access to the signals provided by
respondent No.1. Therefore, it cannot be disputed that the price or prices received or receivable by
respondent No.1 is the amount received or receivable by him for transmitting the signal for
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
100
exhibition of any performance, film or any other programme telecast and the aggregate of such
prices or amounts is the gross receipt of respondent No.1 in relation to any month or part thereof.
10.9.9 It was observed with reference to Western India Theatres that existence of means or
providing entertainment would be sufficient to support a law imposing tax thereon and that the
means of providing entertainment provides the nexus between the taxing power and the subject of
tax. It was further observed that if one is looking at the means of providing entertainment, both the
cable operator and the sub-cable operator play equally significant role in providing such means of
entertainment, namely, transmission of signals received from the satellites. In one sense the cable
operator plays a more pivotal role than the sub-cable operator since the signals are received by him
through his devices and transmitted while a sub-cable operator makes provision for continued
instantaneous transmission of the signals. 10.9.10 It was further observed that the impugned
legislation was in pith and substance not relating to broadcasting but one relating to entertainment
within the scope and ambit of Entry 62 – List II. Accordingly, the appeals filed by the State of West
Bengal were allowed by setting aside the judgment of the Calcutta High Court.
10.9.11 On a perusal of the judgment in Purvi Communication, it can be observed that there was no
specific question raised as to, whether, the act of transmission by MSO has a ‘public colour’ to it. In
fact, the Court was never required to go into such a question, for the impugned provision, i.e. section
4A(4a) of the 1982 Act, did not require such a ‘public colour’ to the activities of MSO. 10.10 There
are other substantial differences between Geeta Enterprises and Purvi Communication as the table
below enumerates due to which Geeta Enterprises and Purvi Communication cannot be compared.

Date of Enactment of the provision impugned therein 1937 1998 Discussion on Entry 62 - List II No
Yes 10.11 It was submitted by Sri Venugopal, learned Senior Counsel that the interpretation of the
word ‘entertainments’ in Entry 62 - List II is restricted to ‘public entertainments’ and this Court was
not right in Purvi Communication to hold that the impugned provision therein was constitutionally
valid without determining whether that provision fell within the restricted interpretation of
‘entertainments’.
10.12 We do not agree with this limited interpretation of the word ‘entertainments’. We hold in line
with the principle that words in entries must be given a broad, liberal and expansive interpretation.
As discussed above, the impugned activity of transmission in Purvi Communication would still fall
under its ambit.
10.13 It is true that in the earlier times, many people did not have access to personal devices through
which they could be entertained. The entertainments, therefore, were mostly restricted to those
performed or displayed in public. With developments in technology, it has become possible for such
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
101
entertainments to be experienced / enjoyed directly at home. In other words, what has changed is
the manner in which entertainments are accessed or consumed. Nowadays, entertainment is
available on a cell/mobile phone in our hands. The forum or platform for entertainment as well as
the manner of perception has changed, namely, from direct/live viewing to digital viewing but the
content is essentially the same, of course, with varieties of programmes, having regard to the target
viewers/audience of such entertainment, etc. That, however, does not change the fact that such
entertainment is curated and transmitted for the benefit of the public at large. Therefore,
interpreting the activity taxed in Purvi Communication in this manner, we hold that television
viewing via DTH would still fall within the ambit of “public entertainments”. 10.14 We also take note
that the question of interpretation of ‘entertainments’ in Geeta Enterprises pertained to the
interpretation of the 1937 Act and not Entry 62 – List II as it appears in the Constitution. The
judgment in Geeta Enterprises can never be a binding precedent for the question raised before this
Court in Purvi Communication. Therefore, whereas the scope of interpretation for Geeta Enterprises
was limited to interpretation of a provision in a statute we would be remiss to hold Purvi
Communication as per incuriam for its failure to take note of Geeta Enterprises. Therefore, we find
no reason to doubt the correctness of Purvi Communication.
“Aspect Theory” or Aspect Doctrine: A Discussion
11. In Canada, the distribution of legislative powers is provided in Sections 91 and 92 of its
Constitution Act, 1867, dividing entries between the Federal Government (under section 91) and the
Provincial Government (under section 92). The ‘Aspect’ theory, also known as the ‘double aspect
doctrine’, is a tool of constitutional interpretation used in Canada to resolve issues which arise when
both the Federal and the Provincial Governments have the right to legislate on a subject matter.
11.1 Lord Haldane, in Union Colliery Co. of British Columbia vs. Bryden, 1899 AC 580 at 587,
commented on the ‘aspect theory’ as follows:
“It is remarkable the way this Board has reconciled the provisions of section 91 and
section 92, by recognizing that the subjects which fall within section 91 in one aspect,
may, under another aspect, fall under section
92."
11.2 The Constitution Bench of this Court, in Federation of Hotel & Restaurant
Association of India, explained this theory by quoting from the book ‘Canada’s
Federal System’ by AHF Lefroy.
The Bench noted as under:
“14. In Lefroy's 'Canada's Federal System' the learned author referring to the "aspects
of legislation" under Sections 91 and 92 of the Canadian Constitution i.e., British
North America Act 1867 observed that "one of the most interesting and important
principles which have been evolved by judicial decisions in connection with the
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
102
distribution of Legislative Power is that subjects which in one aspect and for one
purpose fall within the power of a particular legislature may in another aspect and for
another purpose fall within another legislative power. Learned author says: " ..... that
by 'aspect' must be understood the aspect or point of view of the legislator in
legislating the object, purpose, and scope of the legislation that the word is used
subjectively of the legislator, rather than objectively of the matter legislated upon."
(emphasis supplied) Criticism of its Use in Indian Context:
11.3 Some scholars have criticised the transposition of the Canadian ‘aspect theory’ to
Indian jurisprudence on the ground that the framework of distribution of legislative
competence in Canada is different from that in India and hence, that theory which is
used in Canada cannot be transposed to Indian contexts.
11.4 To substantiate this proposition, it is relevant to note that, firstly, the aspect
theory in Canada is used to resolve conflicts in legitimacy to legislate on all subject
matters, rather than restricting its use only to entries concerning taxation. In India,
the doctrine of pith and substance is predominantly used to resolve conflicts when
two entries in different Lists of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution conflict with
each other. As already noted, the doctrine of pith and substance means that “if an
enactment substantially falls within the powers expressly conferred by the
Constitution upon the legislature which enacted it, it cannot be held to be invalid
merely because it incidentally encroaches upon matters assigned to another
legislature” [Goodyear India Ltd. vs. State of Haryana, (1990) 2 SCC 71, para 71].
11.5 Secondly, as regards taxation in Canada, it appears that Section 91(3) of the
Constitution Act, 1867 therein empowers their Parliament to legislate on “the raising
of Money by any Mode or System of Taxation” whereas, under section 92(2), the
Provinces therein are empowered to legislate only on “Direct Taxation within the
Province in order to the raising of a Revenue for Provincial Purposes”. This means
that the Parliament therein has greater legislative competence to impose a wide range
of taxes, but the Provinces therein are restricted to impose only direct taxes.
Therefore, the scope for the use of ‘Aspect theory’ in taxation matters is limited in Canada. This
distribution of taxation powers in Canada is markedly different from that in India. Under our
Constitution, the subject matters of taxation available to Parliament are enumerated in Entries 82 to
97 - List I and those available to the State legislatures are in Entries 45 to 63 - List II. There is no
taxation entry in List III or the Concurrent List. 11.6 There are also alternate propositions as regards
this theory. For e.g., Sri Karthik Sundaram, in the book ‘Tax, Constitution and the Supreme Court’
(OakBridge Publishing Pvt. Ltd. 2024, p.112), argues that “the ‘aspect theory’ can, in some cases, be
viewed as an exception to the doctrine of ‘pith and substance’”. Contrarily, Sri V Niranjan, K.C. in
Chapter 26 titled ‘Legislative Competence’ in the Oxford Handbook of the Indian Constitution,
argues that there is no distinction between the doctrine of pith and substance and the aspect theory
in the Indian context.
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
103
11.7 Despite the above observations, on a perusal of the cases in India which have referred to this
theory, it would be evident that the use of ‘aspect theory’ in the Indian jurisprudence differs from its
usage in Canada and that it is home-grown and innovated to suit the Indian context particularly in
matters relating to taxation. In other words, while we may have borrowed the theory from Canada,
its application in the Indian context has been within the context of the framework of the Indian
Constitution. The theory is applied so as to save a provision of taxation rather than to a situation
where a legislature’s competence to tax is determined. In other words, the aspect doctrine is applied
to ascertain whether a legislature can tax on a particular aspect of a transaction/activity rather than
on competence of a legislature vis-à-vis the scope of entries in List I or List II.
11.8 To elaborate, it is necessary to revisit some significant judgments which have dealt with the
concept of ‘Aspect theory’ and some judgments that have laid down principles for interpretation of
entries governing taxation in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution.
Usage of Aspect Theory in the Indian Context:
11.9 In International Tourist Corporation vs. State of Haryana, (1981) 2 SCR 364, the
vires of Section 3(3) of the Haryana Passengers and Goods Taxation Act, 1952 insofar
as it permitted the levy of tax on passengers and goods carried by their carriages
plying entirely along the National Highways was questioned. The appellants therein
argued that the Parliament had the exclusive jurisdiction under Entry 23 read with
Entry 97 - List I to legislate in respect of National Highways, including levy of taxes
on goods and passengers carried on National Highways. This Court, however, noted
that Entry 97-List I itself is specific in that, in case of a tax, a matter can be brought
under that entry only if it is not mentioned in either of List I or List II. This Court
further opined that a regulatory and compensatory tax should be upheld if there
exists a “specific, identifiable object behind the levy and a nexus between the subject
and the object of levy”. Having found this nexus, it upheld the imposition of tax
under the impugned section.
11.10 Thereafter, in Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Association of India, the
Constitution Bench of this Court had to decide the constitutional validity of the
Expenditure Tax Act, 1987 (Central Act 35 of 1987) which envisaged a tax at 10 per
cent ad valorem on “chargeable expenditure” incurred in the class of hotels wherein
“room charges” for any unit of residential accommodation were Rs. 400 per day or
more per individual. The Union sought to sustain the legislative competence to enact
the impugned law under Article 248 read with Entry 97 - List I. 11.10.1 One argument
of the appellants therein relevant to this case was that the law was, in pith and
substance, really one imposing a tax on luxuries or on the price paid for the sale of
goods.
It is relevant to note here that a tax on luxuries is an exclusive subject matter of States under Entry
62 - List II. The other contention was that the particular impost under the impugned law, having
regards to its nature and incidence, is really not an “expenditure tax” at all as it does not accord with
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
104
the economists’ notion of such a tax. The question therefore was whether the economists’ concept of
such a tax qualifies and conditions the legislative power and whether “expenditure” laid out on what
may be assumed to be “luxuries” or on the purchase of goods admits of being isolated and identified
as a distinct aspect susceptible of recognition as being distinct field of tax legislation. 11.10.2 This
Court referred to the ‘Aspect theory’ used in Canada by quoting Lefroy’s ‘Canada’s Federal System’
who opined that “one of the most interesting and important principles which have been evolved by
judicial decisions in connection with the distribution of legislative power is that subjects which in
one aspect and for one purpose fall within the power of a particular legislature may in another
aspect and for another purpose fall within another legislative power.
“… that by ‘aspect’ must be understood the aspect or point of view of the legislator in legislating the
object, purpose and scope of the legislation that the word is used subjectively of the legislator, rather
than objectively of the matter legislated upon.” This Court further opined that, “Indeed, the law
'with respect to' a subject might incidentally 'affect' another subject in some way; but that is not the
same thing as the law being on the latter subject. There might be overlapping; but the overlapping
must be in law. The same transaction may involve two or more taxable events in its different
aspects. But the fact that there is an overlapping does not detract from the distinctiveness of the
aspects.” (emphasis supplied) 11.10.3 Reference was made to Lord Simonds in Governor General in
Council vs. Province of Madras, (1945) FCR 179:
AIR 1945 PC 98 in the context of concepts of Duties of Excise and Tax on Sale of
Goods in the following words:
“… The two taxes, the one levied on manufacturer in respect of his goods, the other
on a vendor in respect of his sales, may, as is there pointed out, in one sense overlap.
But in law there is no overlapping. The taxes are separate and distinct imposts. If in
fact they overlap, that may be because the taxing authority, imposing a duty of excise,
finds it convenient to impose that duty at the moment when the excisable article
leaves the factory of workshop for the first time on the occasion of its sale. …” 11.10.4
Referring to the “aspect” doctrine stated in Laskin’s “Canadian Constitutional Law”,
the Constitution Bench further noted that the “aspect” doctrine bears some
resemblances to those noted above but, unlike them, deals not with what the “matter”
is but with what it “comes within” … In this regard it was observed as under:
“It is trite that the true nature and character of the legislation must be determined
with reference to a question of the power of the legislature. The consequences and
effect of the legislation are not the same thing as the legislative subject matter. It is
the true nature and character of the legislation and not its ultimate economic results
that matters.” (emphasis supplied) 11.10.5 In other words, this Court held that the
subject matter of a tax is different from the measure of its levy and that the measure
of a tax does not determine its essential character or of the competence of the
legislature. The Court therefore accepted the submission of the learned Attorney
General and held that the distinct ‘aspect’, namely, the ‘expenditure’ aspect of the
transaction fell within the subject-matter of the Union and that it had the legislative
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
105
competence to impose a tax.
11.11 The Constitution Bench of this Court had to again decide on similar facts in Elel
Hotels & Investments Ltd. vs. Union of India, (1989) 3 SCC 698 (“Elel Hotels &
Investments”).
In this case, the Hotel Receipts Tax Act, 1980 imposed a special tax of 15% on the gross receipts of
certain hotels, where the room charges for residential accommodation provided to any person
during the previous year was Rs.75 or more per day per individual. The petitioners therein argued
that the reliance on Entry 82 – List I in support of the tax was wholly misconceived and the tax in
pith and substance was an impost under Entry 62 – List II reserved to the States. The respondents
however submitted that the word ‘income’ in Entry 82 – List I should not be read in a narrow and
pedantic sense, but must be given its widest amplitude. The Court agreed with the respondents
therein and opined that, “The cardinal rule of interpretation is that the entries in the legislative lists
are not to be read in a narrow or restricted sense and that each general word should be held to
extend to all ancillary or subsidiary matters which can fairly and reasonably be said to be
comprehended in it…In construing the words in a constitutional document conferring legislative
power the most liberal construction should be put upon the words so that the same may have effect
in their widest amplitude.” (emphasis supplied) 11.11.1 While this Court herein did not explicitly use
the ‘aspect doctrine’, it is implied from its reasoning that by interpreting the word ‘income’ liberally,
the impugned legislation had an aspect of ‘income’ and hence the Union had the legislative
competence to impose tax on the subject-matter.
11.12 In State of West Bengal vs. Kesoram Industries Ltd., (2004) 10 SCC 201, the Constitution
Bench of this Court summarised the principles as regards interpretation of taxation entries in List I
and List II. While it did not explicitly refer to the ‘aspect theory’, it opined on different aspects of a
transaction as follows:
“141. As held in Goodricke Group Ltd. [1995 Supp (1) SCC 707] which we have held as
correctly decided, this Court has noted the principle of law well established by several
decisions that the measure of tax is not determinative of its essential character. The
same transaction may involve two or more taxable events in its different aspects.
Merely because the aspects overlap, such overlapping does not detract from the
distinctiveness of the aspects. In our opinion, there is no question of conflict solely on
account of two aspects of the same transaction being utilised by two legislatures for
two levies both of which may be taxes or fees or one of which may be a tax and the
other a fee falling within two fields of legislation respectively available to the two.”
(emphasis supplied) 11.13 In All India Federation of Tax Practitioners, the Court was
concerned with the constitutional validity of the levy of service tax on Chartered
Accountants, Cost Accountant and Architects by Finance Act, 1994 and Finance (No.
2) Act, 1998, and the legislative competence of Parliament to impose service tax
under Entry 97 - List I, in view of Entry 60 - List II which is also a taxation entry and
mentions, “Taxes on professions, trades, callings and employments” and Article 276
of the Constitution.
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
106
This Court held that Entry 60 – List II which refers to ‘professions’ cannot be extended to include
services and opined, “this is what is called as an Aspect Theory”. But it said no more on the theory.
However, from its reasoning that Entry 60 - List II concerns a tax on the status and cannot be read
to include every activity undertaken or service rendered by a chartered accountant/cost accountant/
architect, this Court suggested that the activity in question i.e. service rendered by such
professionals did not have an aspect that can be covered by Entry 60 - List II which was only
regarding being a part of a particular profession. It was further observed that a tax cannot be levied
under the Finance Act, 1994 and its amendments without service being provided whereas a
professional tax under Entry 60 - List II is a tax on his status. It is the tax on the status as a Cost
Accountant or a Chartered Accountant. As long as a person or a firm remains in the profession, he/it
has to pay professional tax. That tax has nothing to do with the commercial activities which he
undertakes for his client. Even if the chartered accountant has no work throughout the accounting
year, still he has to pay professional tax. He has to pay the tax till he remains in the profession. This
is the ambit and scope of Entry 60 - List II which is a taxing entry. Therefore, Entry 60 contemplates
tax on professions, as such. 11.13.1 Referring to Western India Theatres Ltd. it was observed that
Entry 50 of the Provincial List of the Government of India Act, 1935 contemplated a tax on
entertainment or amusement as objects on which a tax was to be imposed and therefore it was not
possible to differentiate between the entertainment provider and the entertainment receiver. 11.13.2
It was also highlighted that the importance of the judgment in Western India Theatres Ltd. was in
the fact that it made a distinction between tax imposed for the privilege of carrying on any trade or
calling on one hand and a tax on every show, that is to say on every incidence of the exercise of the
particular trade or calling. It was held that if there was no show, there was no tax. It was held that
the impugned tax on entertainment levied by the Cantonment Board was a tax on the act of
entertainment resulting in a show and, therefore, the impugned law imposing tax on entertainment
fell under Entry 50 of the Provincial List in Schedule VII to the Government of India Act, 1935 and
not under Entry 46 of the Provincial List (similar to Entry 60 - List II). Therefore, it was held that
Bombay legislature had power to enact the law imposing tax on entertainment which had nothing to
do with the law imposing tax on the privilege of carrying on any profession, trade or calling under
Entry 46 (similar to Entry 60 - List II in the present case). Therefore, this Court had clarified the
dichotomy between tax on privilege of carrying on any trade or calling on one hand and the tax on
the activity which an entertainer undertakes on each occasion. The tax on privilege to practise the
profession, therefore, falls under Entry 60 - List II. It is quite different from tax on services. Keeping
in mind the aforestated dichotomy, it is clear that tax on service does not fall under Entry 60 - List
II. Therefore, Parliament has absolute jurisdiction and legislative competence to enact the law
imposing tax on services under Entry 97 - List I. 11.14 In Union of India vs. Mohit Minerals Pvt. Ltd.,
(2018) 13 SCR 139 (“Mohit Minerals Pvt. Ltd.”), this Court explicitly held that, “the principle is well
settled that two taxes/imposts which are separate and distinct imposts and on two different aspects
of a transaction are permissible as “in law there is no overlapping”.” In this case the bone of
contention between the parties was whether an Indian importer can be subject to the levy of
Integrated Goods and Service Tax (“IGST”) on the component of ocean freight paid by the foreign
seller to a foreign shipping line, on a reverse charge basis. The notifications impugned in the said
case whether amounted to leading to double taxation was considered.

11.14.1 The contention of the respondents therein was that the transaction between the foreign
exporter and the respondents was already subject to IGST under Section 5 of the IGST Act read with
Section 3(7) and 3(8) of the Customs Tariffs Act as “supply of goods”, and an additional levy of IGST
on imported goods, that is on the supply of transportation service, by designating the importer as
the recipient could amount to double taxation. The transaction involved three parties, namely the
foreign exporter, the Indian importer and the shipping line. The first leg of the transaction involved
a CIF contract, wherein the foreign exporter sells the goods to the Indian importer and the cost of
insurance and freight are the responsibility of the foreign exporter. In other words, the foreign
exporter is liable to ensure that the goods reach their place of destination and the Indian importer
pays the transaction value to the exporter. The second leg of the transaction involved an agreement
between the foreign exporter and the shipping line (whether foreign or Indian) for providing
services for transport of goods to the destination i.e., in the territory of India. The appellant- Union
of India contended that the contract between the foreign exporter and the foreign shipping line – of
which the Indian importer is not a party – cannot be deemed to be a part of “composite supply”
within the meaning of Section 2(30) of the Central Goods and Service Tax Act (“CGST Act”). It was
contended that while the first leg of the transaction, between the foreign exporter and Indian
importer, is (according to the submission) a composite supply, the second leg is an independent
transaction. In this regard, the Union of India relied on the decision of this Court in State of Andhra
Pradesh vs. Mc Dowell & Co, (1996) 3 SCR 721 (“Mc Dowell”) to contend that a single element can
constitute a levy and a part of the value for another transaction. Further the Union Government
urged that the levy is on different aspects of the transaction.
11.14.2 This contention was not acceded to by this Court. It was ultimately held that the impugned
levy imposed on the “service” aspect of the transaction is in violation of the principle of “composite
supply” enshrined under Section 2(30) read with Section 8 of the CGST Act. Since the Indian
importer is liable to pay IGST on the “composite supply”, comprising of supply of goods and supply
of services of transportation, insurance, etc. in a CIF contract, a separate levy on the Indian importer
for the “supply of service” by the shipping line would be in violation of Section 8 of the CGST Act.
Hence the appeal filed by the Union of India was dismissed.
11.15 The judgment of this Court in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited appears to have approached the
application of ‘aspect theory’ differently. The principal issue which arose therein was, whether, the
nature of transaction by which mobile phone connections (through SIM cards) are enjoyed is a sale
or a service or both. If it is a sale then the States are legislatively competent to levy sales tax on the
transaction under Entry 54 – List II but if it is a service, then the Parliament alone can levy service
tax under Entry 97 – List I but if the nature of the transaction partakes of the character of both sale
and service, then the moot question would be whether both legislative authorities could levy their
separate taxes together or only one of them. The contention of the appellants therein was that the
transaction in question was merely a service and therefore only the Union had the competence to
levy tax thereon. However, the respondents States argued that the transaction was a deemed sale
under Article 366(29A)(d) of the Constitution read with the charging sections in their various sales
tax enactments and therefore they were competent to levy sales tax on the transactions.

108
11.15.1 The impugned judgments therein had held that there was a sale of SIM cards by the service
providers to the subscribers and that it is factually and legally distinct from the activity of giving
connection or activation of SIM cards. However, this Court held that the expression ‘goods’ do not
include electromagnetic waves or radio frequencies for the purpose of Article 366(29A)(d) and that
the goods in telecommunication are limited to the handsets supplied by the service provider.
11.15.2 This Court clarified that what a SIM card represents is ultimately a question of fact. That in
determining such an issue, the Assessing Authorities had to keep in mind the principle that if the
SIM card was not sold by the assessee to the subscribers but was merely part of the services
rendered by the service providers, then a SIM card could not be charged separately to sales tax.
However, if the parties intended that the SIM card would be a separate object of sale, only then it
would be open to the Sales Tax Authorities to levy sales tax thereon. Therefore, the Court held that,
as far as SIM cards were concerned, the issue was left for determination by the Assessing
Authorities. 11.15.3 Further, this Court noted that the State would have had the power to separate
the agreement to sell from the agreement to render service and impose tax on the sale, only if the
transaction in truth represents two distinct and separate contracts and is discernible as such. It held
that the test for composite contracts, other than those mentioned in Article 366(29A), would be the
intention of the parties and if there was no intention of sale of goods, then the State cannot impose a
sales tax even if the contract could be disintegrated. Furthermore, the Court held that it would be
possible for the State to tax the sale element provided there is a discernible sale and only to the
extent relatable to such sale. 11.15.4 As regards the ‘aspect theory’, this Court noted that the High
Court in the impugned judgment therein could not have used the theory to “enable the value of the
services to be included in the sale of goods or the price of goods in the value of the service” and that
the ‘aspect theory’ merely deals with legislative competence. It further noted, observing on the
judgment of this Court in Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Association of India that:
"subjects which in one aspect and for one purpose fall within the power of a
particular legislature may in another aspect and for another purpose fall within
another legislative power. They might be overlapping; but the overlapping must be in
law. The same transaction may involve two or more taxable events in its different
aspects. But the fact that there is overlapping does not detract from the
distinctiveness of the aspects".
11.15.5 It further held that no one denies the legislative competence of States to levy sales tax on
sales provided that the necessary concomitants of a sale are present in the transaction and the sale is
distinctly discernible in the transaction. After narrating the Constitutional history which led to the
amendment of Article 366 by insertion of clause (29-A) by the Forty Sixth Amendment to the
Constitution, it was observed that of all the different kind of composite transactions, the draftsman
of the Forty Sixth Amendment chose three specific situations namely, a works contract, a
hire-purchase contract and a catering contract to bring them within the fiction of a deemed sale. Of
these three, the first and third involve a kind of service and sale at the same time. Apart from these
two cases where splitting of the service and supply has been constitutionally permitted in sub clause
(b and f) of Clause (29-A) of Article 366, there is no other service which has been permitted to be so
split. It was further observed that if there is an instrument of contract which may be composite in
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
109
form in any case, other than the exceptions in Article 366 (29-A), unless the transaction in truth
represents two distinct and separate contracts and is discernible as such, then the State would not
have the power to separate the agreement to sale from the agreement to render service and impose
tax on the sale. The test therefore for the composite contract other than those mentioned in Article
366 (29- A) continues to be: did the parties have in mind or intend separate right arising out of the
sale of goods? If there was no such intention there is no sale even if the contract could be
disintegrated. The test for deciding whether a contract falls into one category or other is to ask what
is the substance of the contract. In other words, the court termed it ‘the dominant nature test’.
11.15.6 It was further observed that what a SIM Card represents is ultimately a question of fact. It
was also observed that the States have the power to levy sales tax on sales provided the necessary
concomitants of a sale are present in the transaction and the sale is distinctly discernible in the
transaction. This does not however allow the State to entrench upon the Union List and tax any
service by including the cost of such service in the value of the goods. Even in those composite
contracts which are by legal fiction deemed to be divisible under Article 366 (29-A), the value of the
goods involved in the execution of the whole transaction cannot be assessed to sales tax. For the
same reason the Centre cannot include the value of the SIM Card, if they are found ultimately to be
goods, in the cost of the service.
11.15.7 Therefore, this Court did not apply the aspect theory in the aforesaid judgment because it did
not find an aspect of sale in the activity of mobile phone connections. It was observed that the aspect
theory would not apply to enable the value of the services to be included in the sale of goods or the
price of goods in the value of the service.
11.15.8 In the aforesaid case, reference was made to Gujarat Ambuja Cements Ltd. vs. Union of
India, (2005) 4 SCC 214. In this case, the writ petitions were filed challenging the constitutional
validity of Sections 116 and 117 of the Finance Act, 2000 and Section 158 of the Finance Act, 2003 by
which the decision of this Court in Laghu Udhyog Bharti vs. Union of India, (1999) 6 SCC 418
(“Laghu Udhyog Bharti”) striking down Rules 2 (1)(d)(xii) and (xvii) of the Service Tax Rules, 1994
(as amended in 1997) was sought to be overcome. The writ petitioners were the customers or the
clients of goods transport operator and of forwarding and clearing agents. One of the contentions
raised was that the Parliament was not competent to levy the service tax as it encroached upon the
States Government power as defined in Entry 56 – List II which pertains to “taxes on goods and
passengers carried by road or an inland waterways”. That Parliament could not by resorting to the
residuary Entry 97 – List I circumvent Entry 56 – List II and in the guise of levying service tax in
fact, levy a tax on transport of goods. The imposition of service tax on the customers was challenged
by many of the writ petitioners in Laghu Udhyog Bharti but in the later case the legislative
competency to levy service tax on carriage of goods by transport operators was not considered. It
was contended that the subject fell under Entry 56 – List II and therefore could not come within
Entry 23 read with Entry 97 – List I. This contention was not accepted. In paragraph 27 of this
judgment, it was observed that there is a distinction between the object of tax, the incidence of tax
and the machinery for the collection of the tax. The distinction is important but is apt to be
confused. Legislative competence is to be determined with reference to the object of the levy and not
with reference to its incidence or machinery. There is a further distinction between the objects of
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
110
taxation in our constitutional scheme. The object of tax may be an article or substance such as a tax
on land and buildings under Entry 49 - List II, or a tax on animals and boats under Entry 58 - List II
or on a taxable event such as manufacture of goods under Entry 84 - List I, import or export of
goods under Entry 83 - List I, entry of goods under Entry 52 - List II, or sale of goods under Entry
54 - List II to name a few. Dealing with Entry 56 – List II it was held that the subject matter of
taxation under that entry are goods and passengers. The phrase “carried by road or natural
waterways” carves out the kinds of goods or passenger which or who can be subject to tax under the
entry. After making an analysis of the entry with reference to the dictum in Rai Ramakrishna vs.
State of Bihar, AIR 1963 SC 1667, it was observed that entry 66 read with Section 65 (41)(j) and 67
(m-a) in Chapter V of the Finance Act, 1994 did not seek to levy tax on goods or passengers but the
service of transportation itself which is a distinct levy from what is envisaged under Entry 56 – List
II. It may be that both the levies are to be measured on the same basis but that does not make the
levy the same. Placing reference on Federation of Hotels and Restaurant Association of India, it was
observed that service tax is not a levy on passengers and goods but on the event of service in
connection with the carriage of goods; it is not therefore, possible to hold that the Act in pith and
substance is within the States’ exclusive power under Entry 56 - List II. It was further observed that
the point at which the collection of the tax is to be made is a question of legislative convenience and
part of the machinery for realisation and recovery of the tax. The manner of the collection has been
described as “an accident of administration; it is not of the essence of the duty”. It will not change
and does not affect the essential nature of the tax. Subject to the legislative competence of the taxing
authority, a duty can be imposed at the stage which the authority finds to be convenient and the
most effective, whatever stage it may be. The Central Government is therefore legally competent to
evolve a suitable machinery for collection of the service tax subject to the maintenance of a rational
connection between the tax and the person on whom it is imposed. By Sections 116 and 117 of the
Finance Act, 2000, the tax is sought to be levied on the recipients of the service. They cannot claim
that they are not connected with the service since the service is rendered to them. It was observed
that if in substance, the statute is not referrable to a field given to the State, the Court will not by any
principle of interpretation allow a statute not covered by it to intrude upon this field.
11.16 It is relevant at this juncture to discuss the judgment of this Court in Imagic Creative. In that
case, the appellant- company was an advertising agency which used to create original concept and
design advertising material, brochures, annual reports etc. for its clients. It used to file its returns
for service tax under Finance Act, 1994 and also for sales tax under Karnataka Sales Tax Act, 1957.
There was no express contract between the appellant and their clients. But their purchase order and
invoice showed three categorical divisions; i) the amount of service tax on the specific design and
production; ii) the amount of sales tax on the specified item on the first sale; and iii) when certain
items are outsourced, the tax payable on resale of the said goods in terms of section 6(4) of the
Karnataka Sales Tax Act, 1957. The assessing authority concerned, however, held that the entire
activity undertaken by the appellant therein was a comprehensive contract and hence the entire sale
value including the creation of concept and design, formed part of the value of sale and was
accordingly liable to tax. The said order was confirmed by Tribunal as well as High Court.
11.16.1 The question before this Court was, whether, the charges collect towards the services for the
evaluation of the proto- type conceptual design (that is creation of concept), on which service tax has
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
111
been paid under the Finance Act, 1994 as amended from time to time are liable to tax under
Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003. This Court allowed the appeal filed by the appellant therein.
It held that payments of service tax as also Value Added Tax are mutually exclusive and therefore,
they should be held to be applicable having regard to their respective parameters. It noted that a
distinction must be borne in mind between an indivisible contract and a composite contract and that
if in a contract, an element to provide service is contained, the purport and object for which the
Constitution was amended so as to insert Article 366(29A) must be kept in mind.
11.16.2 It was observed that the appellant in the said case (Imagic Creative) admittedly was a service
provider and therefore was assessable to a service tax under the Finance Act, 1994 which is a
Parliamentary statute. That while interpreting a taxing statute under Article 246 of the Constitution
read with Seventh Schedule thereof, the Court may have to take recourse to various theories
including “aspect theory”, as was noticed by this Court in Federation of Hotels and Restaurant
Association of India. It was further observed that where a Parliamentary and State Act come up for
consideration, an endeavour has to be made to see that provisions of both the Acts are made
applicable. That payment of service tax and also VAT are mutually exclusive, they should be held to
be applicable having regard to the respective parameters of service tax and the sales tax as envisaged
in a composite contract as contradistinguished from an indivisible contract. It may consist of
different elements providing for attracting different nature of levy. It is, therefore, difficult to hold
that in a case of this nature, sales tax would be payable on the value of the entire contract,
irrespective of the element of service provided. Aspect Theory: Its Extent and Scope in India:
11.17 On a perusal of the significant judgments of this Court which have used or
referred to ‘aspect theory’, two observations can be made at the outset: first, it is
discerned that Courts in India have not used ‘aspect theory’ in the manner that is
applicable in Canada; and second, there appears to be a lack of clarity as to its
conceptual contours. For e.g., there is no clarity on i) the instances when ‘aspect
theory’ needs to be applied; or ii) whether ‘aspect theory’ has any relevance in
determining the legislative competence of the Union or a State in enacting a tax
legislation. The judgment in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited opines that aspect theory
is ‘merely concerned with legislative competence’, whereas the judgment in Imagic
Creative expressly suggested that in the matter of interpretation of a taxing statute, in
the context of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, the Court may have to take
recourse to various theories including the “aspect theory” as was noticed by this
Court in Federation of Hotels and Restaurants Association of India. Amidst this
uncertain jurisprudence, several impugned judgments in the present cases have
referred to the ‘aspect theory’ to uphold the validity of several State legislations
imposing entertainment tax. It therefore becomes necessary to examine the
conceptual contours of this theory. 11.18 To appreciate the extent and the context of
the use of ‘aspect theory’ in India, it would be instructive to reiterate some
well-established principles of interpretation of taxation entries.
Some of the relevant principles are reiterated as follows:
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
112
i. In interpreting expressions in the Legislative Lists of the Seventh Schedule of the
Constitution, a wide meaning should be given to the entries.
ii. In the scheme of the Lists in the Seventh Schedule, there exists a clear distinction
between the general subjects of legislation and heads of taxation. They are separately
enumerated.
iii. As the fields of taxation are to be found clearly enumerated in Lists I and II, there
can be no overlapping in law. There may be overlapping in fact, but there can be no
overlapping in law. iv. In the first instance, the pith and substance or true nature and
character of the legislation must be determined with reference to the legislative
subject matter and the charging section;
v. The measure of tax is not a true test of the nature of tax; vi. The same transaction
may involve two or more taxable events in its different aspects. Merely because the
aspects overlap, such overlapping does not detract from the distinctiveness of the
aspects.
11.19 Having noted few established principles of interpretation of taxation entries,
there are three specifics that must be kept in mind while discussing this theory. The
first is the taxation entries provided for in List I and List II; the second is the
legislation which seeks to impose a tax on a subject-matter; and the third is the
activity on which tax is sought to be imposed by the legislative enactment.
11.20 We observe that based on a reading of the cases discussed earlier and the
provisions of the Constitution, especially Chapter I of Part XI of the Constitution
which deals with legislative relations between the Union and the States and
distribution of legislative powers, that the legislative competence is determined by
applying the doctrine of pith and substance which governs the relation between the
entries provided in the three Lists of the Seventh Schedule while considering the vires
of a legislation impugned on the basis of the principle of legislative competence.
The aspect theory has no relevance in determining the constitutionality of any provision on the
ground of legislative competence. Rather, aspect theory concerns the relation between the
legislation which seeks to impose a tax on a subject-matter and the activity sought to be taxed. In
other words, the constitutional validity of a taxing statute on the grounds of legislative competence
has to be examined in the context of the doctrine of pith and substance as envisaged under Article
246 of the Constitution of India to ascertain whether a particular legislature i.e., Parliament or a
State Legislature, as the case may be, has the competence to legislate in relation to the particular
field of legislation while interpreting the field of legislation as epitomised in the respective entries in
the three Lists. A broad perspective of the entries must be envisaged. Once the contours of the entry
under which a legislation is made is ascertained, the next step is to study the legislation in question
in order to ascertain whether it is covered or falls within the contours of an entry. If it does fall
within the contours of a particular entry in a particular List, then that particular legislature which
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
113
has enacted it would have the legislative competence to enact such a legislation. If it incidentally
touches upon an entry in another List, it does not render it invalid. That means that so long as a
piece of legislation is in pith and substance coming within an entry in a particular List, it would be
valid as the legislature which has enacted, has the legislative competence to do so.
11.21 The aspect theory has really no role to play as regards determining legislative competence of a
particular legislation, since the Constitution does not envisage such a test. However, in the Indian
context, the ‘aspect theory’ is relevant to determine the applicability of a taxing statute on the
activity sought to be taxed i.e., whether the statute covers a transaction/activity which falls within a
specific taxation entry either in List I or in List II. An activity may have multiple aspects on which
different legislatures can impose a tax falling within its legislative competence. In such a situation,
the courts would save the tax from a challenge on the basis of the aspect theory by discerning which
aspect of the activity falls within the subject matter of tax under a legislation relatable to a particular
entry of a List in the Seventh Schedule. Such a determination of the aspects which are present in an
activity is a factual inquiry. Thus, an activity could be taxed by two different legislatures on the basis
of the entries in the respective Lists without there being a clash and within their legislative
competence. However, the aspect of the activity which is being taxed must be relatable to the
legislation under a specific entry of a particular List so as to be within legislative competence of a
particular legislature. 11.22 This is in contrast to the applicability of this theory in Canada, where
this theory is used therein to determine legislative competence of a federal or provincial legislature
to enact a particular law. The reason why we observe that the aspect theory has no relevance in
determining the constitutional validity of a legislation is that such a ground is not prescribed
anywhere in the Constitution. This Court in Mc Dowell held that the power of the Parliament or, for
that matter, the State legislature, to legislate can be struck down by Courts on two grounds and two
grounds alone, viz., (i) lack of legislative competence; and (ii) violation of any of the fundamental
rights guaranteed in Part-III of the Constitution or any other constitutional provision. This Court
was categorical in noting that there was no third ground. Similarly, in Anjum Kadari vs. Union of
India, 2024 INSC 831, this Court had to decide whether a statute can be struck down for violation of
basic structure of the Constitution, and based on a survey of prior judgments, held as follows:
“55. From the above discussion, it can be concluded that a statute can be struck down
only for the violation of Part III or any other provision of the Constitution or for
being without legislative competence. The constitutional validity of a statute cannot
be challenged for the violation of the basic structure of the Constitution. The reason
is that concepts such as democracy, federalism, and secularism are undefined
concepts. Allowing courts to strike down legislation for violation of such concepts will
introduce an element of uncertainty in our constitutional adjudication. Recently, this
Court has accepted that a challenge to the constitutional validity of a statute for
violation of the basic structure is a technical aspect because the infraction has to be
traced to the express provisions of the Constitution. Hence, in a challenge to the
validity of a statute for violation of the principle of secularism, it must be shown that
the statute violates provisions of the Constitution pertaining to secularism.”
(emphasis supplied) 11.23 We have already discussed earlier in this judgment that in
case of an apparent overlapping between two entries, the doctrine of pith and
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
114
substance is applied to find out the true character of the enactment and the entry
within which it would fall. This doctrine is not a judicial innovation, but is derived
from the phrase ‘subject to’ and ‘with respect to’ in Article 246 of the Constitution of
India. However, such a derivation cannot be made vis-à-vis ‘aspect theory’ from any
provision of the Constitution of India. Therefore, as far as determining the
constitutional validity of a taxing statute is concerned, when it is challenged on the
ground of legislative competence, it is the doctrine of pith and substance that would
be applicable, rather than the aspect theory. 11.24 Thus, in our view, the aspect
theory, in the Indian context, comes into play at the level of determining the
applicability of a taxing statute on the activity sought to be taxed. Invariably, an
activity conducted by an assessee which is sought to be taxed by a legislation, may
have different aspects. The aspect theory is used to determine if, in fact, there are
different aspects within the activity sought to be taxed and whether, the taxable event
which forms the basis of the levy in a legislative enactment corresponds to any aspect
in the activity sought to be taxed. 11.25 It would be illustrative to consider the facts of
the case in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited to explain the application of this theory. In
that case, the principal question to be decided was the nature of the transaction by
which mobile phone connections were enjoyed. On the one hand, the petitioners
therein contented that they were merely licensees under Section 4 of the Telegraph
Act, 1885 and that they provided ‘telecommunication services’ as provided under
section 2(k) of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1997. That service tax
was imposed on them under the Finance Act, 1994 on the basis of the tariff realised
from the subscribers. They further contended that in providing such service there
were in fact no 'sales' effected by the service providers and that the SIM card was
merely an identification device for granting access and was a means to access
services. On the other hand, the States contented that the transaction was a deemed
sale under Article 366 (29A)(d) of the Constitution read with the charging sections in
their various sales tax enactments and therefore they were competent to levy sales tax
on the transactions. 11.26 This Court, inter alia, clarified that electromagnetic waves
or radio frequencies are not goods, and therefore, there cannot be a ‘sale’ of such
waves or frequencies. It held that a telephone service is nothing but a service. That
there was no sale element apart from the obvious one relating to the handset, if any.
However, as regards SIM card, it observed that “what a SIM card represents is ultimately a question
of fact as has been correctly submitted by the States”. It held that if the parties intended that the
SIM card would be a separate object of sale, only then it would be open to the Sales Tax Authorities
to levy sales tax thereon. Therefore, as far as SIM cards were concerned, the Court left the issue for
determination by the Assessing Authorities. 11.27 If we proceed to understand the above facts from
the perspective of aspect theory enunciated above, it would be clear that the question in essence in
Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited was whether there was an aspect of sale in the activity of the
petitioners therein and consequently, whether the States could validly impose sales tax thereon. This
is nothing but a question of the applicability of the various state enactments on the activity in
question, rather than a question of the validity of the enactment. The Court ultimately held that
electromagnetic waves were not ‘goods’. However, it left the issue of SIM cards to the determination
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
115
of Assessing Authorities. This meant that, on a case-to-case basis, the Assessing Authorities had to
determine whether there was an aspect of sale in the activity they sought to bring to tax, by
examining whether the parties intended that the SIM card was a separate object of sale. In other
words, the Assessing Authorities had to make a factual enquiry as to whether there was an aspect of
sale in the activity they sought to tax under the relevant sales tax legislation. If there was an aspect
of sale, then sales tax was leviable but if it was purely service then sales tax could not be levied. But
what would be the position if an activity has an aspect of sale as well as service? Applying the said
analogy to the instant case, the question is, what is the consequence if an activity has an
entertainment aspect as well as a service aspect/element. Application of Aspect Theory to the Case
at hand:
11.28 To determine whether there are different aspects to the activity conducted by
the assessees herein which is sought to be taxed by the Union under the Finance Act,
1994 (as amended in different years) as a service tax and by the States under different
State legislations as entertainment tax, it is first necessary to examine the taxable
events which form the basis of levy of the legislative enactments impugned herein.
Thereafter, the modus operandi of the activity undertaken by the assessees herein
needs to be understood. Thereafter, a factual determination as to, whether, the
taxable event which forms the basis of the levy under the Central and the State
enactments corresponds to different aspects of the activity under consideration must
be undertaken.
12. Under the Finance Act, 1994 as amended from time to time, the expression
“broadcasting” is defined in Section 65(15) in terms of clause (c) of Section 2 of the
Prasar Bharti Act, 1990 which defines it to mean the dissemination of any form of
communication through space or through cables intended to be received by the
general public either directly or indirectly through medium of relay stations and all
its grammatical expressions and cognate expressions are to be construed accordingly.
Under Section 65 (72) (zk) “broadcasting agency” is a service provider and the service
rendered by a such an entity is a taxable service. The expression ‘taxable service’ is
defined in Section 65(105)(zk) to mean any service provided to a client, by a
broadcasting agency or an organization in relation to broadcasting, in any manner.
12.1 Section 66 (5) of the Finance Act, 1994 as amended from time to time is the charging section
and service tax at the rate of 5% of the value of the taxable service (broadcasting service in the
instant case) as defined above is chargeable to tax. Thus, the tax is 5% of the value of taxable services
levied on the service provider rendering broadcasting services.
12.2 The expression “broadcasting” has been expanded from time to time to include not only
dissemination of any form of communication but also programme selection, scheduling or
presentation of sound or visual matter on a radio or a television channel that is intended for public
listening or viewing, as the case may be, irrespective of where the location of the broadcasting
agency is. In the year 2002, Section 65 (90) (zk) was amended whereby the “broadcasting agency”
could provide service by its representative in India or any agent appointed in India or by any person
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025

116
appointed to act on his behalf in any manner. This is irrespective of whether encryption of the
signals of beaming thereof through satellite might have taken place outside India or not. 12.3 The
definition of “broadcasting” read with “broadcasting agency or organization” was amended in the
year 2003, wherein it said that a “broadcasting agency” or organization means any agency or
organization engaged in providing service in relation to broadcasting in any manner irrespective of
its location and includes inter alia a representative in India or any agent appointed in India engaged
in the activity of selling of time slots for broadcasting of any programme or obtaining sponsorships
for programme or collecting the broadcasting charges on behalf of the said agency or organisation.
12.4 In the year 2005, the Finance Act, 1994 was again amended to define “broadcasting” to include
a broadcasting agency or an organization collecting the broadcasting charges for transmission of
electromagnetic waves through space or through cables, direct to home signals or by any other
means to cable operator including multisystem operator or any other person on behalf of the said
agency or an organization through any representative or agent appointed in India. Thus, service tax
was levied on direct to home (DTH) broadcasting services.
Modus Operandi of the Assessees and their aspects:
13. As regards the business of the assessees herein, they are DTH broadcasting service providers
licensed by the Central Government in terms of the provisions of Section 4 of the Indian Telegraph
Act, 1885 and Section 5 of the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933. Their modus operandi is that
they set up a hub which enables them to downlink signals from the satellites of various broadcasters
of TV channels (Star, BBC, etc.), then they uplink those signals to their own Ku Band (such as
INSAT 4CR satellite) designated transponders for transmission of the signals in Ku band. These
signals are received by the dish antennae which are installed at the subscribers’ premises. Since
these signals are in encrypted form they are decrypted by the Set-Top Boxes and the viewing cards
inside these boxes enable subscribers to view the various TV channels on their TV sets. Invariably,
the set-top boxes are installed without any consideration and remain the property of the assessees.
13.1 If we closely examine the modus operandi of the activity undertaken by the assessees, it would
be evident that their activity involves at least two aspects: the first, is the act of relaying the signals
from the satellites of various broadcasters of TV channels, and the second, is the object of such
relaying of the signals, which is the effect of the content delivered to the subscriber. This effect is
nothing but the entertainment of the subscribers. In other words, the activity of the assessees
involves at least two aspects which correspond to the subject-matter of the levy under the Central
Finance Act, 1994, namely, broadcasting service and the respective State enactments as providing
entertainment to the subscribers. 13.2 It is the contention of the assessees that their activity merely
involves the relaying of the signals and they are in no way related to the content that these signals
carry and are not concerned with providing entertainment. However, as held in Purvi
Communication, no entertainment can be presented to the viewers unless the broadcaster transmits
the signals for instantaneous presentation of any performance, film or any programme on their T.V.
screen. The second aspect here concerns not the kind of content of the signals, rather it is the effect
of the decryption of the signals by the Set-Top Boxes and the viewing cards inside these boxes
provided by the assessees. Without the apparatus provided for by the assessees to decrypt the
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
117
signals, the subscriber would not be able to watch the content that is transmitted, the content being
for the purpose of entertainment. In other words, the State enactments are concerned about
broadcasting for the purpose of entertainment. It makes an assumption that whatever be the
content, the very act of presentation of any performance, film or any programme on the T.V. screen
leads to entertainment which is reckoned to be a luxury. Therefore, the assessees as DTH operators
have direct and proximate nexus with Entry 62 – List II. The entertainment provided by them
through their modus operandi is a luxury within the meaning of that entry.
13.3 Although, the case at hand is different from Purvi Communication in two respects; however, in
our view, these differences are immaterial and only support the view that the observations in Purvi
Communication are squarely applicable to the modus operandi of the assessees and the second
aspect herein. Firstly, in the present case, the mode of transmission is through DTH broadcasting
services and not transmission via cable. Secondly, the present is a case of direct transmission by the
assessees to the customers and not through a hierarchical network of cable operators. In our view,
both these differences do not detract from the view of this Court in Purvi Communication that the
activity of providing and receiving broadcast signals and then relaying them ahead is ‘no doubt, an
act of offering entertainment to the subscribers and/or viewers’ and, consequently, the State
legislatures are competent to enact laws under Entry 62 – List II imposing taxes on entertainment.
The first difference noted above merely speaks to the difference in medium of transmission and does
not deviate from the essential nature of the activity, as discussed in Purvi Communication. The
second differentiation, again, only makes clearer the proximity of the assessees herein with the act
of entertainment. In some manner, it is fair to suggest that the defence of lack of remoteness to the
act of entertainment taken by the cable-operators in Purvi Communication is, in fact, not available
to the assessees herein and therefore they are not on a better footing, at least on this limited
question. 13.4 Furthermore, with reference to our semantical survey of ‘entertainments’ above, the
assessees are clearly engaged in ‘work in connection with, or for the purposes of, any cinema,
exhibition or entertainment.’ Juxtaposing our view with the observations of this Court in Purvi
Communication, we also find that the activity of the assessees is an ‘action of providing or being
provided with amusement or enjoyment’.
13.5 The first aspect discussed above correlates with the imposing of service tax by the Parliament,
and the second aspect correlates with the imposition of entertainment tax by the States, through
their respective enactments. Thus, the activity of entertainment falls within the scope and ambit of
Entry 62 – List II as being a specie of luxury. The service of broadcasting rendered falls under Entry
97-List I. Therefore, both the taxes, one, by the State Legislature and the other, by the Parliament
are leviable on the activity of the assessees herein. This is because by rendering the service of
broadcasting, the assesses are entertaining the subscribers within the meaning of Entry 62-List II.
There may be an overlapping, in fact, inasmuch as different aspects of the same activity is being
taxed under two different legislations by two different legislatures. But, there is no overlapping in
law. This is because the activity of broadcasting is a service and liable to service tax imposed by the
Parliament (Entry 97 – List I) and the activity of entertainment is a subject falling under Entry
62-List II and therefore, the assessees herein are liable to pay entertainment tax as well. Hence, the
State Legislatures as well as the Parliament, both have the legislative competence to levy
entertainment tax as well as service tax respectively on the activity carried out by the assessees

herein.
Allahabad High Court’s Ruling on retrospective operation of the Amendment:
14. Another question which arises in relation to the Impugned Judgment dated 27.07.2012 of the
Allahabad High Court is whether notices issued before the Amendments of 2009 came in force
could demand entertainment tax for the period before express provisions in respect of DTH services
were inserted in the U.P. Entertainment and Betting Tax Act, 1979 (‘the 1979 Act’). In other words,
whether the amendments were merely clarificatory in nature and entertainment tax on DTH
services could be levied retrospectively? A brief legislative history of the 1979 Act is relevant for our
consideration:
i. The Act was promulgated in 1979. Sub-clause (a) to Section 2 defined ‘admission to
entertainment’ to include admission to any place in which entertainment is held.
Sub-clause (g) to Section 2 defined ‘entertainment’. Section 2(l) defined ‘payment for
admission’. On a conjoint reading, Section 2(g) read with Section 2(a) defined the
scope of entertainment chargeable to tax under Section 3 of the Act.
ii. In 1995, to bring cable services within the scope of the Act, the State Legislature vide U.P. Act No.
28 of 1995 amended the 1979 Act by defining ‘cable services’ and ‘cable television network’ and
inserting Section 4C, a separate charging section for levying entertainment tax on cable services.
Sub- section (2) of Section 4C provided that the tax payable under this section shall be paid,
collected and realized in such manner as may be prescribed. Therefore, the collection machinery was
prescribed within the section itself. iii. In 2001, the State Legislature by way of U.P. Act No. 15 of
2001 amended the 1979 Act again by inserting the definition of ‘cable operator’.
iv. Pertinently, the U.P. Ordinance No. 4. Of 2009 dated 16.06.2009 amended several provisions of
the 1979 Act to provide for imposition of entertainment tax on DTH services. Sub-clause (a) was
amended to broaden ‘admission to entertainment’ to include entertainment provided by means of
cable television network or DTH. After sub-clause (f) to Section 2, sub-clause (f-1) was inserted
defining ‘Direct-to- Home service’ to effectively expand the scope of the charging section to include
direct to home services. The definition of ‘payment for admission’ in Section 2(l) was expanded by
inserting sub-clause (vi) and sub-clause (vii) which included ‘contribution or subscription or
installation and connection charges or any other charges’ collected for television exhibition though
cable television network or for the purpose of DTH service. The State Legislature passed the bill by
which the Ordinance was promulgated into the Act which was notified on 27th August 2009 and
came into force w.e.f. on 16th June 2009.
v. On September 4th, 2009, a Notification No. 1672/XI-Ka.Ni.-6- 2009-M.(92)-2009 was issued
under the Act notifying the rates of entertainment tax. For DTH Services, Item No. 5 provided a levy
of 25 per cent out of each aggregate payment. 14.1 We may note that we are concerned only with the
period prior to 16.06.2009 i.e. the day prior to coming into force of the express provisions for DTH
services inserted in the 1979 Act. 14.2 The impugned judgment took note of the view of Patna High
Court in Sky Vision T.V vs. State of Bihar, 1995 (2) BJLR 845 which had held that the imposition of
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025

119
entertainment tax on cable operators was liable to be set aside in the absence of specific charging
section and relevant specific entry for cable services. Impugned Judgment also noted the judgment
of the Uttarakhand High Court in Dish TV India Ltd. vs. State of Uttarakhand, W.P. (M/S) No.
2562/2007 wherein the learned Single Judge allowed a batch of writ petitions preferred by service
providers by holding that in absence of any specific provision in the 1979 Act – the State of
Uttarakhand had adopted the 1979 Act - no entertainment tax can be levied on DTH services. The
Uttarakhand High Court also negatived the argument that merely because express provisions to tax
cable services were present on the statute book they could be broadly read to tax DTH Services. The
learned Single Judge had, despite holding in favour of the service providers, observed that it was
open to the legislature to introduce appropriate amendments. Aggrieved, an appeal was preferred by
the State of Uttarakhand before the Division Bench in, inter alia, Special Appeal No. 21/2009 which
was also dismissed on the ground that DTH services were not covered under the Act. Aggrieved by
the decision of the Division Bench, the State had preferred SLP(C) No. 14605/2009 which was
dismissed in limine by this Court vide order dated 16.07.2009. 14.3 On the other hand, the
Impugned Judgment cited with approval the judgment of Madhya Pradesh High Court at Jabalpur
in Tata Sky Ltd. vs. State of M.P., W.P. No.10148/2009 which had upheld the levy of entertainment
tax on DTH services even for the period when no specific provision was present in the Madhya
Pradesh Entertainments Duty and Advertisements Tax Act, 1936 (‘M.P. 1936 Act’) for levy of
entertainment tax on DTH services. Some sections of the M.P. 1936 Act are relevant to extract
herein. Section 2(b) defined "entertainment" as:
"'Entertainment' includes any exhibition, performance, amusement, game or sport to
which persons are admitted for payment."
14.4 Section 2(d) defined "payment for admission". At the time of consideration by the Madhya
Pradesh High Court, Section 2(d) read as under :
"2(d). 'Payment for admission' includes—
(i) any payment for seats or other accommodation in any form in a place of
entertainment ;
(ii) any payment for a programme or synopsis of an entertainment ;
(iii) any payment made for the loan or use of any instrument or contrivance which
enables a person to get a normal or better view or hearing or enjoyment of the
entertainment, which without the aid of such instrument or contrivance, such person
would not get;
(iv) any payment made by a person by way of contribution or subscription or
installation and connection charges or any other charges, by whatever name called,
for providing access to any entertainment, whether for a specific period or on a
continuous basis;
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
120
(v) any payment, by whatever name called for any purpose whatever, connected with
an entertainment, which a person is required to make in any form as a condition of
attending, or continuing to attend the entertainment, either in addition to the
payment, if any, for admission to the entertainment or without any such payment for
admission;
(vi) any payment, made by a person, who having been admitted to one part of the
place of entertainment is subsequently admitted to another part thereof, for
admission to which a payment involving tax or more tax is required;
Explanation I.—Any subscription raised or donation collected in connection with an entertainment
in any form shall be deemed to be payment for admission.
Explanation II.—Where entertainment is provided as part of any service by any person, whether
forming an integral part of such service or otherwise the charges received by such person for
providing the service shall be deemed to include charges for providing entertainment or access to
entertainment also."
14.5 Section 4 provided the machinery for effectuating the charge. Pertinent for our interest is that
Section 3-B, which was inserted in the M.P. 1936 Act with effect from 01.04.2000, dealt with cable
operators. Sub-section (1) of Section 3-B dealt with entertainment duty payable by cable operator
and it made a cable operator, providing access to entertainments through cable service to
subscribers of such service, not being owner or occupants of rooms of hotel or lodging house, liable
to pay duty at the rate of twenty rupees per month per subscriber in urban and cantonment areas.
14.6 The High Court, after surveying observations of this Court on the scope of ‘entertainment’, held
that even in the absence of a specific section the inclusive definition of "entertainment" under
section 2(b) would subsume the "entertainments" provided by DTH services and tax on DTH
services can, therefore, be realised from the service provider the said expression in any case used in
a plural sense under the Constitution.
14.7 Significantly, the aforesaid judgment of the Madhya Pradesh High Court was overruled by this
Court in Tata Sky Ltd. vs. State of M.P., (2013) 4 SCC 656 (“Tata Sky v. M.P.”) holding that DTH
services are not covered by the provisions of Section 3 read with Sections 2(a), 2(b) and 2(d) of the
M.P. 1936 Act. It was noted that the history of legislative amendments showed that the M.P. Act of
1936 was inadequate to bring shows by video cassette recorder or video cassette and player and
cable T.V. operations within the tax net, and hence specific sections were brought in. It was also
noted by this Court that the collection machinery for levy of entertainment tax on cable TV
operations was in-built and provided within the respective provisions of Section 3-B and lay not
within Section 4, which provided the general collection machinery. Holding that as the M.P. Act of
1936 was concerned only with place-related entertainment, DTH services could not be brought
within the tax net.

121
14.8 Coming back to the impugned judgment, it was argued before the Allahabad High Court that
DTH services were not covered under the U.P. Entertainment and Betting Tax Act, 1979 prior to the
2009 amendments, and this was apparent from the fact that the State had to bring in specific
amendments to levy entertainment tax on DTH services as well as to prescribe a charging machinery
for such a levy, which was earlier absent. Additionally, it was argued that there is no taxation by
implication and therefore the express provisions for levy of entertainment tax on cable operators in
the 1979 Act cannot be given a reading so broad to also include DTH services. Summarily, it was
argued that substantial amendments were brought in the Act which cannot be given retrospective
effect. However, this argument was negatived by the High Court by observing that inclusion of the
words ‘Direct- to-Home service’ in Section 2(f-1) and Section 2(l)(vi) and (vii) was only by way of
clarification to include DTH services. 14.9 According to the High Court, Section 3 i.e. the charging
section made it clear that the tax is on entertainment and when viewed broadly, the emphasis of the
Act was on entertainment and not the means through which such entertainment was being provided
to the subscriber. Furthermore, the High Court did not accept the contention of the writ petitioners
therein that there is a difference between cable services and DTH services. Reliance was placed on
the judgment of this Court in Purvi Communication to observe that the tax is not on the vehicle for
transporting the contents and the method, but is on the entertainment itself. Noting that as modern
technologies develop ‘it will not be necessary for the Act to be amended again to impose
entertainment tax on such entertainments’ as the principal activity will continue to remain
entertainment and not the method by which the entertainment is provided, the High Court held that
entertainment tax on DTH service is liable to be paid both for pre-amended period as well as after
the amendments discussed above.
14.10 Useful to note is that both the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench of the Uttarakhand
High Court had concluded that the State could not treat DTH service providers on par with cable
operators for levy of entertainment tax due to the stark technological differences between the two. It
stands to reason that these technological differences also manifest into the specificity and
operations of these services. Similar provision for taxing cable operations was also present in the
M.P. Act of 1936. 14.11 As the Impugned Judgment was pronounced on 27.07.2012 and the
judgment of this Court was pronounced on 16.04.2013, the High Court did not have the benefit of
this Court’s opinion in Tata Sky v. M.P. Even otherwise, in our view, there needs to be a specific
inclusion of DTH services within the ambit of entertainment in the charging provision of the
relevant taxing statute. In the absence of specificity, the lacuna of a missing taxable event persists
insofar as bringing DTH services within the taxing net is concerned. It is trite law that no vagueness
can be permitted in taxing statutes neither can a tax be levied by implication. Precisely this lacuna
was sought to be filled by way of substantial amendments brought in by Amending Act of 2009.
Furthermore, when the charging Section 4C levied entertainment tax on a ‘cable television network’
providing cable service, the statutory definitions of ‘cable service; and ‘cable television network’
could not be so broadly read to include DTH services. Inserted in 1995, Section 2(ee), in essence,
defined cable service to mean the ‘transmission by cables of programmes’ and Section 2(eee), in
essence, defined ‘cable television network’ to mean a system designed to provide ‘cable service for
reception by multiple subscribers;’. In our view, to countenance reading in DTH service in the
aforesaid carefully incised definitions would be to militate against the literal meaning of words. We
need not reiterate that the activity of the DTH service does not involve transmission by cables of
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
122
programmes. For these reasons, we are of the view that the State of U.P. cannot take strength from
the unamended 1979 Act to levy entertainment tax for any period before the amendments came in
force. Consequently, the conclusion of the Allahabad High Court that the entertainment tax on DTH
service is thus liable to be paid both for pre-amended period as well as after the amendment is not
correct. The amendments made cannot be construed to be a clarification to include the DTH service
as a new technology and method within the purview of the Act. Hence, in the above context and to
the limited extent, the appeal filed against the judgment of the Allahabad High Court is allowed.
State of Kerala vs. Asianet:
15. By the impugned order dated 28.06.2012 passed in W.P.(C) No. 33966/2006 (R),
the Kerala High Court, while hearing the matter after it being remanded by this
Court, held that the impugned provisions of The Kerala Tax on Luxuries Act, 1976(for
short, ‘the Kerala Act of 1976’) which authorized the levy and collection of luxury tax
on cable TV operators only with connections of 7500 or above was discriminatory
and hence the impugned provision was struck down for being unconstitutional and
invalid. 15.1 The proceedings in the first round of the same writ petition are germane
to the impugned judgment. By judgment dated 27.08.2009 the High Court had
initially dismissed the writ petition filed by Cable TV Operators challenging the
constitutional validity of levy of luxury tax with effect from 01.04.2006. However,
this Court by order dated 03.02.2011 in C.A. 1433-34/2011 had remanded the matter
back to the Kerala High Court to consider the additional grounds under Article 14
raised by the Cable TV Operators.
15.2 While hearing the matter upon remand, the impugned judgment dated
28.06.2012 was passed. Pertinent to note is that by way of amendment dated
11.11.2011 all cable operators were deleted from the purview of the Kerala Act of 1976
w.e.f. 01.04.2011. Hence, the impugned judgment was only concerned with recovery
of arrears of luxury tax for the period 2006-2010. 15.3 By way of the Kerala Finance
Act, 2006, the State legislature amended the Kerala Act of 1976 and introduced
luxury tax on cable TV operators @ Rs.5/- per connection to be collected and
remitted from every subscriber of cable TV. Initially, the amendment made with
effect from 01.04.2006 was challenged on several grounds:
firstly, the service provided by the cable TV operators did not amount to “luxury”
within the meaning of Entry 62 - List II as well as the definition of “luxury” contained
in the Act. Secondly, the impugned provisions were discriminatory and violative of
Article 14 of the Constitution in as much Direct to-Home operators providing the
same service to consumers were not subjected to luxury tax.
As the Kerala High Court dismissed the writ petition, the cable TV operators
challenged the decision before this Court. During the pendency of the appeals in this
Court, the Government of Kerala retrospectively amended the Kerala Act of 1976 by
exempting cable TV operators who had less than 7500 connections w.e.f.
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
123
01.07.2006. As the writ petitioner therein came within the taxing net, this
retrospective amendment was used as a new ground before this Court along with the
argument that the Kerala High Court had not considered the challenge on the anvil of
Article 14 of the Constitution with reference to Direct-to-Home operators who were
also providing the same service.
15.4 In the second round of litigation before the High Court, the first contention
raised by the cable TV operators was that Section 2(ee) of the Kerala Act of 1976
defines “luxury”, however, cable TV connection cannot be considered a “luxury” as it
is subscribed by a large number of people in the State and monthly contribution is
only around Rs.200/-. This argument was rejected by the High Court relying on the
decision of this Court in Purvi Communication. It noted that even though
“entertainment” as such is not specifically defined under the Kerala Act of 1976 and
only the expression “luxury” is, the High Court noticed that Entry 62 - List II
specifically covers “entertainments” separately and therefore the State can levy tax on
“entertainments” as tax on “luxury” under the said entry of the Constitution.
15.5 Furthermore, relying on Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, the High Court held
that the same transaction may attract liability as service tax as well as liability for tax
under any other permissible in law. Therefore, the High Court held that the service
rendered by cable TV operators involved “entertainment” to subscribers and
attracted luxury tax as well as service tax.
15.6 However, the third contention raising an Article 14 challenge by the cable TV
operators was accepted by the High Court. The High Court held that by way of the
2010 Amendment retrospectively exempting all cable TV operators who have less
than 7500 connections from tax liability was an unreasonable classification made as
the cable TV operators who have above 7500 connections are discriminated by
making them solely liable to pay luxury tax. After noting that the amendment puts
more than 90% of the operators outside the taxing limit, it was observed that the
classification defeats the intent of the legislation as the incidence of tax is intended to
be on the subscribers for the entertainment they enjoy, and the cable TV operator is
only a collecting agency by virtue of the charge on them under the Act. That the
subscriber is agnostic to whether the facility enjoyed by him is provided by a cable TV
operator serving above or below 7500 connections and that such a distinction enables
the subscriber to avoid tax liability by joining an operator with less than 7500
connections. Finally, the High Court noted that the Amendment of 2011 had
completely deleted cable TV operators from the purview of the Kerala Act of 1976 and
that the matter only served the purpose of collecting arrears from the cable TV
operators with connections above 7500 for the period from 2006 to 2010.
15.7 Although the High Court had already accepted the Article 14 argument, the Cable
TV Operators requested the High Court to consider the additional ground of
discrimination and violation of Article 14 with reference to the DTH operators, who
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
124
provide the same service as cable TV operators to the subscribers. The High Court
while rejecting this contention held the argument is academic in nature because
during 2006 when luxury tax was introduced on cable TV operators, Direct-to-Home
connections (DTH) were not in vogue and as and when the DTH operations became
extensive, the Government introduced luxury tax on DTH operators. It was observed
that the ground of discrimination cannot be considered hypothetically or
theoretically and it has application only when the parties in relation to whose
operations discrimination is alleged also are in actual and effective business.
15.8 Therefore, in sum and substance, the provisions of the state Act authorizing levy and collection
on Cable TV Operators with connections of 7500 or above was declared as unconstitutional for being
discriminatory and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. Submissions:
15.9 On behalf of the State of Kerala, Sri Shishodia, learned senior counsel, has
argued that the State has a wide discretion in selecting the persons or objects it will
tax, and that a statute is not open to attack on the ground that it taxes some persons
or objects and not others, vide East India Tobacco Company vs. State of Andhra
Pradesh, (1963) 1 SCR 404 (“East India Tobacco Company”).
Judgments relied upon by State of Kerala:
15.10 A few of the judgments relied upon by Sri Shishodia, learned Senior Counsel
appearing for the State of Kerala, in support of his contentions, are discussed as
follows:
15.10.1 As regards the applicability of tests of discrimination in a taxing law, this
Court in East India Tobacco Company held that while taxation laws must also pass
the test of Article 14, in deciding whether a taxation law is discriminatory or not, it is
necessary to bear in mind that the State has a wide discretion in selecting the persons
or objects it will tax, and that a statute is not open to attack on the ground that it
taxes some persons or objects and not others. This Court noted that it is only when
the law operates unequally within a range of its selection and such inequality cannot
be justified on the basis of any valid classification, that the law would be violative of
Article 14 of the Constitution.
15.10.2 Further, this Court in P.M. Ashwathanarayana Setty vs. State of Karnataka,
(1989) Supp. (1) SCC 696 (“P.M. Ashwathanarayana”) and in R.K. Garg vs. Union of
India, (1981) 4 SCC 675 noted that the State enjoys the widest latitude where
measures of economic regulation are concerned, and that courts give a larger
discretion to the Legislature when it comes to matters of the latter’s preferences of
economic and social policies.
As further held in Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Association of India, the test of the vice of
discrimination in a taxing law are, therefore, less rigorous.

15.11 On the question of the constitutionality of classification on the basis of criterion such as scale
of operations, profits of businesses, etc., the following judgments were cited:
(i) In Kodar vs. State of Kerala, (1974) 4 SCC 422, this Court rejected a contention
that the impugned provision therein imposing different rates of tax upon different
dealers depending upon their turnover which in effect meant that the rate of tax on
the sale of goods would vary with the volume of the turnover of a dealer was violative
of Article 14 of the Constitution. This Court held that a legislative classification
making the burden of the tax heavier in proportion to the increase in turnover would
be reasonable. As regards the reasoning for the same, this Court noted, “A
classification, depending upon the quantum of the turnover for the purpose of
exemption from tax has been upheld in several decided cases. By parity of reasoning,
it can be said that a legislative classification making the burden of the tax heavier in
proportion to the increase in turnover would be reasonable. The basis is that just as
in taxes upon income or upon transfers at death, so also in imposts upon business,
the little man, by reason of inferior capacity to pay, should bear a lighter load of
taxes, relatively as well as absolutely, than is borne by the big one. The flat rate is
thought to be less efficient than the graded one as an instrument of social justice. The
large dealer occupies a position of economic superiority by reason of his greater
volume of his business.” (emphasis supplied)
(ii) Similarly, in Kerala Hotel and Restaurant Association vs. State of Kerala, (1990) 2
SCC 502, the question before this Court was, whether, the taxing of only the sale of
costlier cooked food in posh eating houses (determined on the basis of their annual
turnover or as determined by Tourism Department of Government of India) while
exempting cooked food sold in modest eating houses at lesser prices violates Article
14 of the Constitution. This Court held that the classification so made cannot be
termed as arbitrary, as it was within the limits up to which the legislature is given a
free hand for making classification in a taxing statute.
(iii) Further, the question in Ganga Sugar Corporation Ltd. vs. State of Uttar Pradesh,
(1980) 1 SCC 223 was, inter alia, whether the differential purchase tax imposed by
weight, and not price, of sugarcane bought by factories and units, at one rupee 25
paise per quintal and 50 paise per quintal respectively, was discriminatory. This
Court held that:
“A classification based on scale of operations, product manufactured and other
substantial differences bearing on production capacity, profits of business and ability
to pay tax, is constitutionally valid and the feeble contention counsel put forward that
there is discrimination between owners of factories and units must fail without much
argument.” 15.12 That, this Court has held that it is for the State to decide what
economic and social policy it should pursue and what factors advance those social
and economic policies, vide P.M. Ashwathanarayana.

15.13 Reliance was also placed on the decision of this Court in Federation of Hotel &
Restaurant Association of India wherein this Court, in the facts therein, held that the
basis of classification in enactment cannot be said to be arbitrary or unintelligible,
nor as being without a rational nexus with the object of law. In that case, a hotel
where a unit of residential accommodation was priced at over Rs 400 per day per
individual was classified as luxury in the legislative wisdom by virtue of the economic
superiority of those who might enjoy its custom, comforts and services.
15.14 It was also contended that the High Court erred in relying on statistics
regarding the cable TV operators and their subscribers to hold that more than 90% of
the operators being outside the scope of taxation detracts from the intent of the
legislation. It was contended that such an exercise is one only within the executive
domain. In the same vein, it was also argued that economic legislation is empirical in
nature as well as based on experimentation and therefore, ordinarily must allow for
greater latitude to be given to the legislature. Reliance was also placed on TwyFord
Tea Co. vs. State of Kerala, 1970 (1) SCC 189 to contend that in matters of
classification for taxation the burden of proof is on the person alleging discrimination
and such burden is heavier when a taxing statute is challenged.
15.15 In our view, the facts of this case, C.A. No 9301/2013, and the issues raised
herein stand on a different footing from other cases in this batch of appeals, which is
concerned with the imposition of levy on DTH operators. After the 2010
amendments, the structure of charging section i.e. Section 4 qua cable operators
stood as such:
(i) Sub-clause(ii) to sub-Section (1) to Section 4 provided for levy of luxury tax in
respect of any luxury provided by cable operators;
(ii) Sub-clause(iv) to the first proviso to sub-Section (1) to Section 4 provided that
sub-Section(1) would not apply to cable operators with seven thousand and five
hundred or connections or less; and
(iii) Second Proviso to sub-Section (1) to Section 4 provided that cable operators with
seven thousand and five hundred or less connections shall not be liable to tax from
1st July, 2006.
15.16 Pertinently, the Finance Act, 2011(Act No. 16 of 2011) deleted all cable operators from the
purview of the Kerala Act of 1976. Therefore, the impugned judgment dated 28.06.2012 is only
concerned with the levy of luxury tax on only on cable TV operators from 2006-2010.
15.17 In our view, the High Court erred in holding that the classification was unreasonable and
lacked any rational nexus with the objects of the Kerala Act of 1976. Indeed, the intent of a taxing
statute is to broaden the tax base and raise revenue for the State, however it is also settled law that
the judiciary will ordinarily allow for greater latitude to be given to the legislature and defer to its

127
economic wisdom in taxing statutes. In Income Tax Officer, Shillong vs. R. Takin Roy Rymbai,
(1976) SC 670, this Court had usefully held that:
“… Given legislative competence, the legislature has ample freedom to select and
classify persons, districts, goods, properties, incomes and objects which it would tax,
and which it would not tax. So long as the classification made within this wide and
flexible range by a taxing statute does not transgress the fundamental principles
underlying the doctrine of equality, it is not vulnerable on the ground of
discrimination merely because it taxes or exempts from tax some incomes or objects
and not others. Nor the mere fact that tax falls more heavily on some in the same
category is by itself a ground to render the law invalid. It is only when within the
range of its selection, the law operates unequally and cannot be justified on the basis
of a valid classification, that there would be a violation of Article 14.” 15.18 Further in
M/s Hoechst Pharmaceuticals Ltd. vs. State of Bihar, AIR 1983 SC 1019, it was
observed that:-
“….On questions of economic regulations and related matters, the Court must defer
to the legislative-judgment. When the power to tax exists, the extent of the burden is
a matter for discretion of the law-makers. It is not the function of the Court to
consider the propriety or justness of the tax or enter upon the reality of Legislative
policy. If the evident intent and general operations of the tax legislation is to adjust
the burden with a fair and reasonable degree of equality, the constitutional
requirement is satisfied. ...” 15.19 We find that the aforesaid observations of this
Court squarely exposit the fallacy in the reasoning of the High Court.
Even if the statistics presented before the High Court regarding the cable TV operators and their
subscribers evinced that the exemption given by the amendment and retrospective exemption
granted by the proviso pushed 90% of the operators outside the scope of taxation, the High Court
ought to have taken note of the apparent intent of the legislature to tax only those with more than
7500 connections. The High Court was obligated to glean the intent of the legislation by accounting
for the exemption provided and not by masking it. The exemption and the proviso, inserted by way
of an amendment, was clearly a statutory tool employed by the legislature to give effect to its
conscious decision to levy tax only on the cable operators with more than seven thousand and five
hundred connections. Furthermore, there is no reason for striking down a law as unconstitutional
merely on the premise that the subscriber could evade or avoid tax liability simply by taking services
of an operator with less than seven thousand and five hundred connections. Where the legislation is
passed in accordance with constitutional prescriptions, a good faith presumption is accorded to the
legislature. Similarly, it is presumed that the legislature acted with due and elaborate understanding
of the societal context for which it legislates. Herein, the legislature perhaps factored that operators
with more than 7500 connections ordinarily give add-on features that closely relate to the character
of luxury. Be that as it may. Unless a violation of fundamental rights or lack of legislative
competence is proved, Courts must be circumspect in interfering with the validity of legislations. It
is trite law that this threshold is even stricter in economic legislations.

128
15.20 In any event, if the High Court was of the view that the exemption created was
unconstitutional then the correct course would have been to strike down the exemption and direct
recovery of tax payable from all assessees for the relevant time period in accordance with
sub-section (1) of Section 4. Instead, the High Court has done the opposite. It declared as
unconstitutional the provisions of the Kerala Act of 1976 authorizing levy and collection on Cable TV
Operators with connections of seven thousand and five hundred and above. As a result, the revenue
payable by a category of assessees who do not fall within the exemption clause is stalled. This not
only affects the State’s exchequer but also does not further the plea of equality pressed into service
by the assessees. The High Court could have struck down the exemption and directed all cable TV
Operators to pay the tax. Instead, while holding that there was a discrimination and violation of
Article 14 of the Constitution the High Court has granted an exemption to even the assessee who was
liable to pay the entertainment tax under the Kerala Act. By placing the assessee on par with those
exempted from payment of entertainment tax, the principle of equality is not applied in its true
spirit to the facts of the case. Rather, the High Court has treated unequals as equals, which is in fact
a detriment to the plea of equality raised by the petitioner assessee. Rather than striking down the
proviso, if the High Court was of the opinion there was a violation of the equality clause under the
Constitution, the High Court has extended the exemption clause to the assessee also, which is
impressible. As a result, no cable TV operator would have to pay any entertainment tax. This lacuna
in the judgment requires a course connection and hence that portion and particularly paragraph
No.6 of the judgment of Kerala High Court dated 28.06.2012 is set aside. The writ petition filed by
the assessee is dismissed and the civil appeal filed by the State of Kerala is liable to be allowed and is
allowed. 15.21 For the aforesaid reasons, the judgment of the Kerala High Court is liable to be set
aside only on the question of holding that the levy of luxury tax on cable TV operators above 7500
connections being discriminatory and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India and thereby
declaring it to be unconstitutional.
Jharkhand High Court’s Ruling:
16. The Jharkhand Entertainment Tax Act, 2012 was published in the Gazette on 27.04.2012. It was
however, under Section 1(3), to come into force on such date as the State Government might, by
notification, direct. The Act was notified by the State Government only on 14.05.2012 with effect
from 27.04.2012 i.e. the date of publication. We do not find any merit in the argument of the
appellants that the State Government could not have directed the Act, a taxing statute, to come into
force with effect from a date anterior to the date of the notification.
16.1 It was contended before the High Court that the Notification dated 14.05.2012 issued by the
State Government under Section 1(3) of the Jharkhand Entertainment Tax Act, 2012 appointing
27.04.2012 as the date of implementation of the Act suffers from the vice of imposing retrospective
taxation in the absence of any express legislative provision providing for it. This argument was
rejected by the High Court vide the impugned judgment. The High Court speaking through
Bhanumati, C.J. (as Her Ladyship then was), vide the impugned judgment, has relied on the
decision of this Court in A. Thangal Kunju Musaliar vs. M. Venkatachalam Potti, (1956) 29 ITR 349
(“A. Thangal Kunju Musaliar”), wherein the controversy concerned The Travancore Taxation on
Income (Investigation Commission) Act, 1949 (“Travancore Act”) passed by the Travancore
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
129
legislature on 07.03.1949. The Act was, under Section 1(3), to come into force on such date as the
Travancore Government might have by notification in the Government Gazette appointed. No
notification was issued by the Travancore Government up to 01.07.1949 when the Travancore State
and the Cochin State integrated into the United State of Travancore and Cochin. On 01.07.1949, the
United State of Travancore and Cochin promulgated an ordinance whereby all existing laws of
Travancore were continued in force till altered, amended or repealed by competent authority and
the “existing law of Travancore” was therein defined to mean any law in force in the State of
Travancore immediately prior to 01.07.1949. On 26.07.1949, a notification was issued under Section
1(3) bringing the Travancore Act into force retrospectively from 22.07.1949. It was contended before
the Constitution Bench of this Court that the notification dated 26.07.1949 could not be given
retrospective effect from 22.07.1949, in absence of any express provision. 16.2 We are conscious the
enactment concerned therein did not impose a tax. However, the question herein simply is, whether,
the Notification dated 14.05.2012 was bad in law for bringing the Act into operation with effect from
the date of publication. In A. Thangal Kunju Musaliar, this Court had repelled a similar argument
observing that in exercise of the power conferred by Section 1(3), the Government had the power to
issue the notification bringing the Act into force on any date subsequent to the passing of the Act. To
give retrospective operation would be to commence the Act from a date prior to the date of its
passing which was not the case in either A. Thangal Kunju Musaliar or is before us. For these
reasons, we find that the High Court was correct in observing that even though the date of
commencement as fixed in the notification might be anterior to the date of notification, the State
Government had the power to bring into force the Act from the date of Gazette publication.
Summary of Discussion and Conclusions:
17. We summarise our discussion and conclusions as under:
17.1 The Civil Appeals filed by the appellants/assessees arising from the judgments of
the High Courts of Delhi, Gauhati, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Madras, Orissa, Punjab &
Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand are dismissed. The appeal filed by the State of
Kerala is allowed. The appeals arising out of the judgments of Allahabad High Court
are allowed in part.
17.2 The provisions relevant to this case under the Kerala Tax on Luxuries Act, 1976;
Uttar Pradesh Entertainment and Betting Tax Act, 1979; Rajasthan Entertainments &
Advertisements Tax Act, 1957 and the Rules thereunder; Gujarat Entertainment Tax
Act, 1977 and Gujarat Entertainment Tax (Exhibition by means of Direct-to-Home
Broadcasting Services) Rules, 2010; Jharkhand Entertainment Tax Act, 2012 and
Jharkhand Entertainment Tax Rules, 2013;
Punjab Entertainment Duty Act, 1955 (Amendment in 2010); Delhi Entertainment and Betting Tax
Rules, 1997; Assam Amusements and Betting Tax Act, 1939; Orissa Entertainment Tax Rules, 2006,
along with the Orissa Entertainment Tax (Amendment) Tax Rules, 2010 are upheld. The correctness
of the findings of the High Court of Madras with regard to the charging section in the State
enactment being defective is assailed by the State of Tamil Nadu in separate appeals which are not

130
part of this batch of appeals, and accordingly have not been taken up for our consideration herein.
Insofar as the Andhra Pradesh Entertainment Tax Act, 1939 (as adopted by State of Telangana) is
concerned, we do not express any opinion as the challenge and applicability of the same is pending
before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh. All contentions regarding the assessment orders arising
under the Andhra Pradesh State enactment are kept open to be advanced before the appropriate
forum. 17.3 The Writ Petitions filed before this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution of India
are accordingly disposed of.
Constitutional Scheme regarding distribution of Legislative Powers:
17.4 Article 246 of the Constitution of India emphasises on Parliamentary supremacy.
Also, the residuary powers of making laws or imposing a tax on any matter not
mentioned under the Concurrent List or State List vest with the Parliament (vide
Article 248 read with Entry 97 - List I).
17.5 Entry 31 – List I deals with various forms of communications including
broadcasting. The said Entry does not deal with entertainments or amusements as
luxuries. Entry 97 – List I deals with any other matter not enumerated in List II or
List III including any tax not mentioned in either of those lists. Entry 31 - List I is a
regulatory entry while Entry 97 - List I, inter alia, can be the basis for imposition of
any tax such as service tax as per the provisions of the Finance Act, 1994 and its
subsequent amendments. 17.6 Entry 33 - List II, inter alia, deals with entertainments
and amusements which is a regulatory entry. Taxes on luxuries including taxes on
entertainments and amusements can be levied by the State under Entry 62
- List II. While Entry 33 - List II is a regulatory entry, Entry 62 – List II is a taxation
entry, both dealing, inter alia, with entertainments and amusements. 17.7 Having
regard to the judgments of this Court in MPV Sundararamier and H.S. Dhillon, we
observe that under the Constitution of India, the power to tax is not an incidental or
ancillary power. The power to tax cannot be implied within a regulatory entry under
our Constitution. There is also a distinction between the power to regulate and
control and the power to tax.
However, occasionally a levy may be imposed as a regulatory measure. Thus, the taxation entries
under List I and List II (there being no taxation entry in the Concurrent List) are clearly demarcated
within the scope of the entries in the aforesaid respective Lists. The effect of this principle is that the
subject of taxation is considered to be a distinct matter for the purposes of legislative competence
and the power to tax cannot be deduced from the general legislative entry as an ancillary power.
17.8 Also, a power to legislate as to the principal matters specifically mentioned in the entries shall
also include within its expanse, a legislation touching upon incidental and ancillary matters. This
principle is derived from the use of the expression “with respect to” in Article 246 of the
Constitution.
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
131
17.9 As a sequitur, reliance can be placed on the dictum of this Court (majority opinion) in H.S.
Dhillon to observe that Entry 97 - List I which is a residuary entry relatable to Article 248 of the
Constitution cannot be invoked or pressed into service when a particular entry empowering the
Parliament or the Legislature of a State to pass laws regarding the taxation on any subject is
specifically enumerated either in List I or List II.
17.10 Consequently, as there is no taxation entry in List III, both the Parliament as well as the
Legislature of the State cannot have competence to levy tax on any one subject of a List.
17.11 Fee in respect of any of the matters in the three Lists does not include the power to levy tax.
The distinction between the levy of fee and levy of tax is clear and it is not necessary to go into that
aspect in these cases, except to reiterate that there is no entry for taxation in the Concurrent List -
List III.
17.12 While interpreting taxation entries in List I or List II, i.e., while determining the legislative
competence to levy a tax, all efforts must be made to interpret them in such a way as to give
expansive content and meaning to the same having regard to the constitutional scheme under which
the distribution of legislative powers has been envisaged in the Seventh Schedule and bearing in
mind the object and intent behind them and also the advances made in human thought and
technology.
17.13 The expression “subject to” and “with respect to” in Article 246 of the Constitution aids the
applicability of the doctrine of pith and substance to find out the true character of the enactment
and the entry within which it would fall. The said doctrine is applied to resolve an issue regarding
legislative competence of a legislature to enact a particular law in relation to a subject relatable to an
Entry in a List under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. Any apparent conflict with respect to
an entry in another List is resolved on the basis of the pith and substance doctrine. Service Tax:
17.14 The expression “broadcasting” has been assigned the meaning as per clause (c)
of Section 2 of the Prasar Bharti (Broadcasting Corporation of India) Act, 1990 in
terms of definition clause in Section 65(13) of the Finance Act, 1994 as amended by
the Finance Act, 2001. Under the Prasar Bharti (Broadcasting Corporation of India)
Act, 1990, the expression “broadcasting” includes dissemination of any form of
communication by transmission of electro-magnetic waves through space or through
cables intended to be received by the general public either directly or indirectly
through the medium of relay stations. 17.15 The expression “broadcasting” and
“broadcasting agency or organization” has been re-defined with the object of
expanding the same. A television program broadcast in India for the general public is
a taxable service in relation to broadcasting, even if the encryption of the signals and
beaming thereof through the satellite might have taken place outside India. 17.16
With the passage of time, the expression “broadcasting” has included transmission of
electro-
The State Of Kerala vs Asianet Satellite Communications Ltd on 22 May, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153032891/
132
magnetic waves through space or through cables, Direct to Home signals or by any means to cable
operator, including multi-system operator or any other person acting on behalf of the said agency or
organisation through its branch office, agent, representative appointed in India or by any person
who acts on its behalf.
17.17 Section 65(72) (zk) defines “taxable service” to include broadcasting agency as a service
provider. Thus, if any service is provided to a client by a broadcasting agency or organization in
relation to broadcasting in any manner, it would be a taxable service.
17.18 The expression “broadcasting agency or organization” means any agency or organization
engaged in providing service in relation to broadcasting in any manner either having its place of
business in India or outside India, through its branch office, subsidiary or representative in India or
any agent appointed in India or any person acting on their behalf.
17.19 Section 66 provides for the charge of service tax which is a charging section. The service tax on
a broadcasting agency is at the rate of five per cent of the value of taxable services i.e., five per cent
of the gross amount charged by the service provider. Broadcasting service is a taxable service and
the broadcasting service provider is required to pay service tax under the provisions of the Finance
Act, 1994 as amended from time to time.
Tax on Luxuries: Entertainments & Amusements 17.20 Bearing in mind the meaning of
“entertainments” and “amusements” and since they come within the scope of “luxuries”, therefore,
the State legislature has legislative competence to impose entertainment tax under Entry 62 - List II
as a tax on luxuries.
17.21 The expression “tax on luxuries” has been discussed, inter alia, in Express Hotels, A.B. Abdul
Kadir, Godfrey Phillips, Western India Theatres, Federation of Hotels and Restaurant Associations
of India.
17.22 The expression “entertainments/ entertainment” has been discussed in the cases of Geeta
Enterprises, Drive-in Enterprises and Purvi Communications. The expression
“entertainments/entertainment” includes within its scope and ambit not only the provider of
entertainment but also the receiver, inter alia, through the medium of television. Thus,
entertainment through television network either through cable television or DTH through set-top
box with the object of providing entertainment to the viewer can be taxed in terms of Entry 62 - List
II. Parameters of Taxation under State Enactments:
17.23 The four parameters of taxation as enumerated by this Court in Govind Saran
Ganga Saran with respect to various provisions of the State enactments under
consideration have been dissected in the form of a tabulation in para 8.29 of this

17.25    The discussion on the content and meaning, scope and
ambit of the expression ‘entertainments’ in Geeta Enterprises is not comprehensive.
This is because, having regard to the advances in technology resulting in varied forms
of entertainments through various media and in a variety of ways, not only in a public
place but also in the confines of private space such as a home, through mobile or a
cell phone or smart watch and other personal devices etc., the expression
‘entertainments’ must be given a broad, liberal and expansive meaning than what has
been discussed in Geeta Enterprises by this Court.
Aspect Theory:
17.26 Aspect theory or double aspect doctrine is a tool of constitutional interpretation
used in Canada to resolve issues which arise when both the federal and provincial
government have the right to legislate on a subject. This Court has applied the aspect
theory in Federation of Hotel and Restaurants Associations of India, Elel Hotels &
Investments, All India Federation of Tax Practitioners and cases such as Mohit
Minerals Pvt. Ltd. and in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited. (in a different way).
17.27 In India, there appears to be no clarity on the application of the aspect theory in
the Canadian sense.
One of the reasons being that in India, both the Parliament as well as the State Legislature do not
have powers to levy tax on the same subject. The aspect theory has been applied in India essentially
to ascertain whether an activity would fall within the scope and ambit of an enactment and whether

135
the said enactment in pith and substance would fall within an Entry of a particular List of the
Seventh Schedule so as to confer legislative competence to tax that aspect of the activity. As a result
it can be said that one aspect of an activity, say broadcasting service, can be amenable to service tax,
while the other aspect of the same activity, namely, providing (of) entertainment to television
viewers (as that is the object of broadcasting) can be amenable to “luxury tax” under Entry 62 List –
II of the Constitution which could be levied on the recipients of such entertainment or on the service
providers who are essentially broadcasters. Broadcasting service being a taxable service under the
provisions of the Finance Act, 1994, read along with the amendments made from time to time would
enable both the Parliament to impose service tax on broadcasting service and the State Legislatures
having the legislative competence to levy entertainment tax on those who provide entertainment to
the recipients (television viewers) to impose a luxury tax. 17.28 We follow the judgment of this Court
in Western India Theatres Ltd. in observing that Entry 62 - List II contemplates a tax on
entertainments or amusements as objects on which a tax can be imposed and therefore it is not
possible to differentiate between an entertainment provider and an entertainment receiver. 17.29 If
the above reasoning is applied, then both entertainment tax as well as service tax can be imposed on
the activity of broadcasting through television for the purpose of entertainment of the subscriber or
the receiver thereof. The two taxes are different aspects of the same activity which enable two
different legislatures to impose tax under distinct taxation entries in two different Lists.
17.30 The principle is well settled that two taxes which are separate and distinct imposed on two
aspects of an activity are permissible, as in law, there is no overlapping. This is because the taxes are
relatable to distinct taxation entries in separate legislative Lists. 17.31 In the instant case, the
Parliament under the Finance Act, 1994 and its amendments is not imposing a tax on
entertainment. Such a tax is being imposed by the State Legislatures as entertainment is a luxury
within the meaning of Entry 62 - List II. In the same way, the Finance Act along with its
amendments seeks to impose a tax on the service rendered by the broadcasting agency which is
imposed under Entry 97 List – I. In the same vein, under Entry 62 List – II, the State Governments
are not imposing any service tax on the assessees.
17.32 While applying the aspect theory on any activity from the point of view of two legislatures
(Parliament and State Legislature), in the instant case, imposing tax on an activity, the following
well established principles of interpretation of tax may as stated in paragraph 11.18 be borne in
mind:
“11.18 To appreciate the extent and the context of the use of ‘aspect theory’ in India, it would be
instructive to reiterate some well- established principles of interpretation of taxation entries. Some
of the relevant principles are reiterated as follows:
i. In interpreting expressions in the Legislative Lists of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, a
wide meaning should be given to the entries.
ii. In the scheme of the Lists in the Seventh Schedule, there exists a clear distinction between the
general subjects of legislation and heads of taxation. They are separately enumerated.

136
iii. As the fields of taxation are to be found clearly enumerated in Lists I and II, there can be no
overlapping in law. There may be overlapping in fact, but there can be no overlapping in law.
iv. In the first instance, the pith and substance or true nature and character of the legislation must
be determined with reference to the legislative subject matter and the charging section;
v. The measure of tax is not a true test of the nature of tax;
vi. The same transaction may involve two or more taxable events in its different aspects. Merely
because the aspects overlap, such overlapping does not detract from the distinctiveness of the
aspects.” 17.33 The doctrine of pith and substance is applied to consider the vires of a legislation
impugned on the basis of the principle of legislative competence in the context of legislative
relationship between the Centre and the State. We observe that the aspect theory has no relevance,
as such, in determining the constitutionality of any provision on the ground of legislative
competence in India. Thus, the constitutional validity of a taxing statute on the ground of legislative
competence has to be examined in the context of the doctrine of pith and substance as envisaged
under Article 246 of the Constitution of India read with the respective entries in the List. Once the
contours of an entry under which a legislation is sought to be made is ascertained, the next step is to
study the legislation in question in order to ascertain whether it falls within the contours of that
Entry. If it does fall within the contours of a particular entry in a particular List, then that particular
legislature which has enacted it would have the legislative competence to enact such a legislation.
But a legislation incidentally touching upon an entry in another List does not render it invalid, it
means that so long as a piece of legislation is in pith and substance falling within an entry in a
particular List, it would be valid as the legislature which has enacted it, has the legislative
competence to do so.
17.34 On the other hand, the aspect theory is relevant to determine the applicability of a taxing
statute on the activity or transaction sought to be taxed i.e., whether the statute covers an activity
which falls within a specific taxation entry, either in List I or in List II. Thus, an activity could be
taxed by two different legislatures on the basis of the entries in the respective Lists without there
being a clash and within their legislative competence. However, the aspect of the activity which is
being taxed must be relatable to the legislation under a specific entry of a particular List so as to be
within the legislative competence of a particular legislature.
17.35 Thus, the aspect theory is used to determine if, in fact, there are different aspects within the
activity sought to be taxed and whether the taxable event which forms the basis of the levy in a
legislative enactment corresponds to any aspect in the activity sought to be taxed.
17.36 This is in contrast to the applicability of this theory in Canada, where this theory is used
therein to determine legislative competence of a federal or provincial legislature to enact a particular
law.
17.37 While applying the aspect theory to the present case, it is noted that the activity of
broadcasting is for the purpose of entertainment of the subscriber as held in Purvi Communications.

No entertainment can be presented to the viewers unless the broadcaster transmits the signals for
instantaneous presentation of any performance, film or any programme on their television. Thus,
there are two aspects in this activity; the first is the act of transmission of signals of the content to
the subscribers. The second aspect here concerns not only the content of the signals, but the effect of
the decryption of the signals by the Set-Top Boxes and the viewing cards inside these boxes provided
by the assessees to the subscribers, which is providing and receiving of entertainment through the
television. Without the apparatus provided for by the assessees to decrypt the signals, the subscriber
would not be able to watch the content that is transmitted, the content being for the purpose of
entertainment. The television entertainment provided by them through their modus operandi i.e.,
by broadcasting, is a luxury within the meaning of Entry 62 - List II. The assessees who are engaged
in the activity of providing entertainment are liable to pay service tax on the activity of broadcasting
under the provisions of the Finance Act, 1994 read with relevant amendments and are also liable to
pay entertainment tax in terms of Entry 62 - List II as being a specie of luxuries. Therefore, both the
taxes, one by the State Legislature and the other, by the Parliament are leviable on the activity of the
assessees herein. This is because by rendering the service of broadcasting, the assesses are
entertaining the subscribers within the meaning of Entry 62 - List II.
There is no overlapping in fact or in law, inasmuch as different aspects of the same activity are being
taxed under two different legislations by two different legislatures. This is because the activity of
broadcasting is a service and liable to service tax imposed by the Parliament (Entry 97 – List I) and
the activity of entertainment is a subject falling under Entry 62 - List II and therefore, the assessees
herein are liable to pay entertainment tax as well. Hence, the State Legislatures as well as the
Parliament, both have the legislative competence to levy entertainment tax as well as service tax
respectively on the activity carried out by the assessees herein.
17.38 As far as the judgment of the Allahabad High Court dated 20.07.2012 is concerned, we observe
that the High Court could not have construed the amendments made to the UP Act of 1979 as a
clarification to include the DTH service which is a new technology, within the purview of the original
Act. Hence, to that limited extent, the appeal filed against the judgment of the Allahabad High Court
is allowed in part.
17.39 The judgment dated 28.06.2012 passed by the Kerala High Court which declared the levy and
collection of luxury tax on cable TV operators with connections of 7500 or above as unconstitutional
for being discriminatory is incorrect.
17.40 The Kerala High Court could have struck down the exemption granted and directed all cable
TV operators to pay the tax instead of holding that there is discrimination and violation of Article 14
of the Constitution against the assessees herein. As a result, the High Court has granted an
exemption to the assessee who is liable to pay entertainment tax under the Kerala Act. As a result,
unequals have been treated as equals which is detrimental to the plea of equality sought to be raised
by the assessee.
17.41 In the circumstances, paragraph 6 of the judgment of the Kerala High Court dated 28.06.2012
is set aside. The Writ Petition filed by the assessee before the High Court is dismissed and the Civil
