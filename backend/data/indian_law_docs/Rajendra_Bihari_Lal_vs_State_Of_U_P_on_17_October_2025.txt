6. Before adverting to the rival submissions canvassed on either side, we deem it appropriate to refer

institution. A. FACTUAL MATRIX
7. FIR No. 224/2022 came to be registered on 15.04.2022 with the PS Kotwali, District Fatehpur, on
the basis of a written complaint filed by one Himanshu Dixit, the Vice President of an organisation
named the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, for the offence punishable under Section(s) 153-A, 506, 420,
467 and 468 of the IPC respectively and Section(s) 3 and 5(1) of the U.P. Conversion Act
respectively, against 35 named and 20 unknown accused persons. The FIR pertains to an alleged
event of mass religious conversion which, according to the complaint, allegedly took place at the
Evangelical Church of India, Hariharganj, Fatehpur on 14.04.2022, which happened to be “Maundy
Thursday”, a day of religious significance for the followers of Christ. Shorn of unnecessary details,
the FIR reads thus:
“To the SHO, Kotwali Sadar, Fatehpur, Sir, It has been requested that today, dated
14.04.2022, we have to inform about the work of forcibly converting innocent Hindus
from Hindu religion to Christianity at their Evangelical Church of India located in
Hariharganj with deceit and fraud was going in full swing. Whose information was
given by the people of the locality to the Hindu organizations. After getting the
information, Himanshu Dixit, co-minister of Vishva Hindu Parishad, along with all
the workers of his organization reached the spot at above church. Then the work of
conversion was going on there. After reaching on to the spot, I, Himanshu Dixit
informed the administrative officials about this religion conversion and requested
them to come to the spot. When the administrative officers reached at the spot, they
questioned the Father of the Church, Vijay Masih, so the Father of the Church Vijay
Masih in the context of this episode of conversion replied by accepting that we are
converting Hindus into Christianity by cheating and threatening by getting them
change their names in documents in tampering with editing in their names in
documents. The process of conversion is going on for the last 34 days in which all
people belonging to the Hindu religion are invited. This conversion work process is
completed in 40 days. We are trying to convert the patients who have come from

Mission Hospital too to get converted. All the employees of Mission Hospital play an
important role in this work. Today, dated 14.04.2022, the names of the people who
were brought for conversion are in presence of the administration are [....] and along
with them about 20 people were converting about 90 Hindu people. As soon as the
above mentioned people got the information about the arrival of Hindu organizations
and administration, then the above mentioned Hindu religion people were quietly
removed from the back door. Therefore, it has been requested to kindly take
necessary action by registering a case FIR against the said accused under the relevant
sections as on the basis of the complaint.
Signature Hindi Himanshu Dixit Applicant Himansh Dixit s/o Shivkant Dixit
(Co-Minister Vishva Hindu Parishad) R/o Chowk Police Station Kotwali District
Fatehpur [...]”
8. A plain reading of the aforesaid indicates that it is the case of the complainant that the accused
persons were found engaged in the ceremony of religious conversion of around 90 persons
belonging to the Hindu community at the Evangelical Church of India located in the Fatehpur
district by the alleged use of force, cheating, fraud and coercion. It is not the case of the complainant
that he was also converted by use of such alleged deceitful and fraudulent means by the accused
persons. His role was that of a whistleblower who provided the information of the alleged incident to
the police authorities. We have thought fit to give the particulars of the complainant as the same
would be vital in deciding the legality and validity of FIR No. 224/2022 in light of the unamended
Section 4 of the U.P. Conversion Act, as we shall discuss shortly hereinafter.
9. While the investigation of the aforesaid FIR was in progress, FIR No. 47/2023 came to be lodged
on 20.01.2023 at the PS Kotwali, District Fatehpur for the offence punishable under Section(s) 3
and 5(1) of the U.P. Conversion Act respectively against 10 named and around 40-50 unnamed
accused at the instance of one Sarvendra Vikram Singh who alleged in the said FIR that during his
visit to the district Fatehpur for some personal work, he was allured into embracing Christianity by
the accused persons. He alleged that he was offered cash, a job with a university and marriage with a
beautiful girl. One of the accused who extended such offer was the Vice-Chancellor of the university,
who is also Petitioner No. 1 in W.P. No. 123 of 2023. The complainant further alleged that having
been allured by the offer made by the accused persons, he converted himself and embraced
Christianity on 25.12.2021 at the Presbyterian Church, Deviganj, Fatehpur. The complainant further
stated in his complaint that with the passage of time, he realized his mistake and returned back to
profess Hindu religion. The contents of FIR No. 47/2023 are reproduced hereinbelow:
“To, the Incharge Inspector, Police Station Kotwali, District Fatehpur. Sir, it is
respectfully submitted that I the applicant Sarvendra Vikram Singh S/o Late Sh.
Surendra Bahadur Singh is a resident of Village & Post Bahauddinpur Police Station
Gasain Ganj Janpath Sultanpur. The applicant in relation to personal work had come

solemnized with a beautiful girl. I got trapped through allurement by the above Ram
Chandra. Then Ram Chandra brought me with him to Indian Presbyterian Church
Devi Ganj and where he introduced me with the Pastor of the Church. Then both the
persons for the sake of religious conversion while again alluring had assured of
providing cash and gifts from time to time and took me to their Main Institution
SHUATS University, Naini, Prayagraj and where I was introduced with R.B. Lal (Vice
Chancellor), Vinod B. Lal, Ajay Laurance, Ramakant, Jonathon Lal, S.B. Lal, Stephen
Pas, Derrek Denis etc. 40 to 50 people who had allured me of providing with cash, job
in SHUATS and marriage with a beautiful girl upon quitting Hindu religion and
adopting Christianity and Ajay Laurance gave me cash Rs.15000/- and R.B. Lal told
that there is a lot of funds with our institution and further in need even more cash
will be given to you. Then alongwith Ram Chandra and Pastor I had returned back to
Church Devi Ganj and converted my religion and became Christian. It was told by
Ram Chandra and the Pastor that now you are a Christian and now you persuade
your friends, relatives and villagers for adopting Christianity and you will be paid
Rs.20000/- in lieu of conversion of each person to Christianity. Our institution is
having a lot of funds. This institution gets foreign funds for the said purpose of
religious conversion. You will have no deficiency of money in your life. Sometime
later my conscience started condemning me and then I again returned back to my
Hindu religion. I was very scared. When through newspapers and social media I
came to know about a fair investigation being carried out by the Fatehpur Police then
daringly I have appeared and informing before you. The said incident pertains to
dated 25 December, 2021. Therefore it is requested before you to kindly register my
report and to take appropriate legal action. Signature applicant Sarvendra Vikram
Singh R/o Village & Post Bahauddinpur PS Gosain Ganj Janpad Sultanpur […]”
10. Three days after FIR No. 47/2023 was lodged, and while the investigation in FIR
No. 224/2022 was still underway, one another FIR being FIR No. 54/2023 came to
be lodged at the PS Kotwali, District Fatehpur, at the instance of one Virendra Kumar
against 47 named and 20 unknown persons on 23.01.2023.
The allegation levelled in the FIR was that the first informant, much like the one in FIR No.
47/2023, along with around 90 more Hindu persons, was allured into embracing Christianity by the
accused persons during an event organised at the Evangelical Church of India, Fatehpur on
14.04.2022. He further alleged that after the mass conversion took place, his Aadhar card was taken
away by the accused persons and his name was changed to Virendra D’Souza. He also alleged that
the accused persons threatened to kill him if he would dare to report about the conversion
anywhere. The contents of FIR No. 54 of 2023, shorn of unnecessary details, are extracted

11. Merely seven minutes after the aforesaid FIR was registered, one another FIR, i.e.,
FIR No. 55/2023 came to be lodged against 47 named and 20 unnamed persons at
the very same police station referred to above, at the instance of one Sanjay Singh
under the very same provisions of the IPC and the U.P. Conversion Act respectively.
In the said FIR too, the first informant alleged conversion by means of allurement at
the alleged event dated 14.04.2022 and the allegations in both the FIRs are virtual
reproductions of each other, except for the change in the personal particulars of the
first informant. The contents of FIR No. 55 of 2023, devoid of unnecessary details are
extracted hereinbelow:
“To, the Incharge Inspector, Police Station Kotwali, District Fatehpur. Sir, it is
respectfully submitted that the applicant Sanjay Singh S/o Rajendra Singh is a

the funds and gifts etc. those are disbursed for religious conversion are being
arranged by Mathew Samuel, Trustee of Broadwell Hospital & Mister Bishop and the
same is aided by SD Rao, Manager of the World Vision India. The said persons were

present in the Church and he had disclosed to me and other persons that he is the
Mission Head of Fatehpur U.P. His office is situated inside the Mission Hospital itself
by the name of Community Health Centre. Today the Pastor Vijay Masih has
completed the entire process of 40 days of your conversion from Hindu religion to

I understood that by threatening and alluring the Hindus they are forced to quit
Hindu religion and convert to Christianity. We want to remain in our Hindu religion.
I was forced to convert to Christianity through allurement and coercion and it was
also disclosed by the said persons that Christian Institutions provide huge funds for
the sake of religious conversion and if required, monetary aid will also be extended to

day of incident, people of Hindu Organization had reached on the spot while religious
conversion was being carried out and those people had opposed the religious
conversion and had also informed the Police. Sir, I have appeared for giving
information that kindly register my report against the aforesaid persons thereby take
appropriate legal action. Date-23.01.2023 Applicant Signature Hindi Sanjay Singh

12. One another FIR, i.e., FIR No. 60/2023, came to be lodged for the very same
offences and at the very same police station at the instance of one Satyapal against 47
named and 20 unnamed accused persons. The allegations in this FIR are also
virtually a reproduction of the allegations made in FIR Nos.
54/2023 and 55/2023 respectively except for the change in the particulars of the first informant. We
are not reproducing the contents of the same for the sake of brevity.
13. Besides the aforementioned FIRs, one another FIR being FIR No. 538/2023 is also the subject
matter of consideration in the present batch, the validity of the same and the proceedings arising
therefrom being a subject matter of challenge in the SLP (Crl.) No. 8615/2024. The said FIR was
lodged at the PS Nawabganj, District Prayagraj on 11.12.2023 at the instance of one Sanjeev Kumar
against the Petitioner in the SLP (Crl.) No. 8615/2024 and a few unknown persons. The allegations
in the said FIR were that on 10.12.2023, when the complainant along with his friend, was on his way
to a village for some work, he was stopped by the accused persons, who used abusive language
against him and also fired a shot at him with the intention to kill him. He further alleged that the
accused also demanded Rs 1 lakh from him failing which the accused threatened to kill him. The
complainant also alleged that the accused person was engaged in performing illegal conversion of
Hindus to Christianity by giving them the allurement of curing diseases like cancer, etc.
14. The aforesaid factual discussion would indicate that three distinct incidents have been alleged
which form the subject matter of the FIRs under challenge in the present batch of petitions:
a. The incident dated 14.04.2022, alleged to have taken place at the Evangelical
Church of India, Fatehpur, wherein alleged mass religious conversion of around 90
Hindus to Christianity took place. The FIR Nos. 224/2022, 54/2023, 55/2023 and
60/2023 respectively pertain to this incident. Out of these four FIRs – FIR Nos. 54,
55 and 60 respectively were lodged at the instance of the first informants who claim
to be the victims of the alleged conversion, whereas FIR No. 224/2022 came to be
lodged at the instance of a person who was not a victim of the said conversion, but
was rather the leader of an organisation.
b. The incident dated 25.12.2021, which took place at the Presbyterian Church,
Deviganj, Fatehpur, wherein the first informant in FIR No. 47/2023 was alleged to
have been illegally converted from Hinduism to Christianity.
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
12
c. The incident dated 10.12.2023 which forms the subject matter of FIR No.
538/2023.
15. Aggrieved by the registration of FIR Nos. 54/2023, 55/2023 and 60/2023 respectively, a number
of writ petitions came to be filed before the High Court seeking quashing of the said FIRs. Further,
an application under Section 482 of the CrPC was also filed before the High Court for quashing of
FIR No. 538/2024 and the consequential proceedings arising therefrom. However, the High Court
declined to entertain the petitions and dismissed the same vide the impugned judgments, which we
deem appropriate to briefly discuss before proceeding further.
16. It is noteworthy that as on date, the investigation is complete in all the aforesaid FIRs and
chargesheets have been filed before the concerned jurisdictional courts. However, for the
convenience of exposition, we shall advert to the details and contents of the chargesheet and case
diary while dealing with the individual FIRs in the later parts of this judgment.
B. IMPUGNED JUDGMENTS
17. The Criminal Appeals arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 7380/2023, SLP (Crl.) No. 13679/2023 and
SLP (Crl.) No. 7233/2023 respectively arise from the impugned common judgment and order dated
02.06.2023 passed by the High Court in a batch of five petitions. The appellants in Criminal Appeal
arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 7380/2023 were the Petitioners in the Criminal Misc.
Writ Petition No. 1819 of 2023 before the High Court and had prayed for the quashing of FIR No.
55/2023. The appellant(s) in Criminal Appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 13679/2023 were the
Petitioners in the Criminal Misc. Writ Petition No. 2360 of 2023 before the High Court and were
seeking quashing of FIR No. 60/2023. Lastly, the appellant in Criminal Appeal arising out of SLP
(Crl.) No. 7233/2023 was the Petitioner in the Criminal Misc. Writ Petition Nos. 1991 of 2023, 1994
of 2023 and 1998 of 2023 respectively before the High Court and was seeking the quashing of FIR
Nos. 55/2023, 60/2023 and 54/2023 respectively.
18. The High Court, in its impugned judgment dated 02.06.2023 has noted that the quashing of the
FIRs as prayed for in the batch of writ petitions was primarily on the ground that the FIRs were
registered at a highly belated stage, the alleged incident having taken place more than a year prior to
the registration of the FIR. The Petitioners before the High Court further contended that the said
FIRs were not the first in point of time in relation to the alleged incident since FIR No. 224/2022
had already been registered pertaining to the very same alleged incident. Thus, the contention of the
Petitioners before the High Court was that the FIRs being repetitive, they were liable to be quashed.
The contentions raised on behalf of the Petitioners therein were met by the State by submitting that
similar petitions challenging FIR No. 55/2023 had already been dismissed by a coordinate bench of
the High Court after taking the view that the FIR disclosed commission of cognizable offences.
19. The High Court, referring to the order passed by a coordinate bench in the Criminal Misc. Writ
Petition No. 1814 of 2023, wherein the challenge to FIR No. 54/2023 was negatived, observed that
FIR No. 224/2022, having been registered at the instance of a person not competent to lodge an FIR
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
13
under the unamended Section 4 of the U.P. Conversion Act, would amount to an invalid FIR in the
eyes of law and therefore the subsequent FIRs registered pertaining to the very same alleged
incident, would not be hit by the dictum as laid in T.T. Antony v. State of Kerala, reported in (2001)
6 SCC 181, as the same would not amount to a second FIR in relation to the same alleged incident.
In light of such reasoning, the High Court dismissed the Writ Petition of the appellants herein.
20. The Criminal Appeal arising out of the SLP (Crl.) 10187/2023 arises from the impugned
judgment dated 05.07.2023 passed by the High Court in the Criminal Misc. Writ Petition No.
5180/2023, wherein the challenge to FIR No. 60/2023 came to be rejected by the High Court on the
ground that a coordinate bench had already declined to quash the FIR in question.
21. The Criminal Appeal arising out of the SLP (Crl.) No. 13231/2023 arises from the impugned
judgment dated 04.08.2023 passed in the Criminal Misc. Writ Petition No. 12146 of 2023 by the
High Court wherein FIR No. 54/2023 was challenged inter alia on the ground that the said FIR
could not be said to be the first FIR in relation to the alleged offence and hence was liable to be
quashed. However, the High Court declined to quash FIR adopting the same line of reasoning as was
adopted in the judgment dated 02.06.2023 impugned in the SLP(Crl.) 7380/2023.
22. The appellant(s) in the Criminal Appeal arising out of the SLP (Crl.) No. 15251/2023 were the
Petitioners in a batch of writ petitions, i.e., the Criminal Misc. Writ Petition Nos. 13610 of 2023,
13566 of 2023, 13597 of 2023 and 13577 of 2023 respectively before the High Court and were
seeking to get FIR No. 60/2023 quashed. However, the High Court declined to quash the said FIR
on the ground that the allegations levelled in the said FIR clearly disclosed the commission of a
cognizable offence, and further the case put up by the Petitioners was in the form of their defence
which could not have been gone into at the stage of seeking quashing of the FIR. The High Court
also observed that the crime as alleged was serious in nature and that the petitions of few other
co-accused had already been dismissed and therefore the petitions preferred by the appellant(s)
herein also deserved to be dismissed.
23. The appellant(s) before us in Criminal Appeal arising out of the SLP (Crl.) No. 3818/2023 were
the Petitioners in the Criminal Misc. Writ Petition No. 1814 of 2023 before the High Court and had
questioned the validity of FIR No. 54/2023. The High Court, in its impugned judgment dated
17.02.2023 observed that the only issue which required determination was whether the said FIR was
covered by the dictum as laid by this Court in T.T. Antony (supra). The High Court observed that
insofar as the contents of FIR No. 224/2022 and 54/2023 respectively were concerned, both had
striking similarities and could be said to have been covered by the decision in T.T. Antony (supra)
had Section 4 of the U.P. Conversion Act not provided for the registration of the FIR only on the
basis of a complaint made by a certain specific class of persons. The High Court held that in view of
Section 4 of the U.P. Conversion Act, FIR No. 224/2022 could not be said to be a validly registered
FIR and thus, FIR No. 54/2023 would have to be treated as the first FIR pertaining to the alleged
incident forming the subject matter of FIR No. 224/2022. In lieu of such reasoning, the High Court
refused to entertain the petition. The relevant observations made by the High Court are reproduced
hereinbelow:
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025

“The only material difference in the two first information reports is that the first was
lodged by an office bearer of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad while the impugned first
information report has been lodged by one Virendra Kumar, who underwent religion
conversion allegedly on account of fraud, misrepresentation, coercion and
inducements. The issue therefore for consideration is whether on account of the
aforenoted difference, the first information report impugned in this writ petition goes
out of purview of the ratio in the T.T. Anthony’s case. The offence alleged in both
FIRs is one under Section 3 of the U.P. Prohibition of Religions Conversion Act,
which prohibits conversion of religion as also its attempt by traced
misrepresentation, force, undue influence, and/or allurement, as also its abatement
and conspiracy.
xxx xxx xxx The impugned first information report apart from sections of the Indian
Penal Code invokes also Section 3 / 5(1) of the Act. In so far as the material
allegations in the first information report are concerned, they pertain to the same
mass conversion ceremony of the same date. Therefore, there is no substantial
difference in so far as the allegations in the two first information reports are
concerned and if this aspect alone is taken into account, the matter at hand is covered
by the ratio in the case of T.T. Anthony’s. However, the situation is confounded by
Section 4 of the Act, which reads as follows – “4. Person competent to lodge First
Information Report, - Any aggrieved person, his/ her parents, brother, sister, or any
other person who is related to him/ her by blood, marriage or adoption may lodge a
first information report of such conversion which contravenes the provisions of
Section 3.” It is this provision, which has been relied upon by Shri Manish Goel,
learned Additional Advocate General. His argument therefore is that it is the second
first information report, which is by the victim is in fact the competent first
information report. Therefore, by implication therefore, it has been submitted that
the first information report lodged by an office bearer of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad
is not a competent first information report and therefore, the impugned first
information report is not contrary or is not barred by the judgement in the case of
T.T. Anthony.
If the argument of Shri Manish Goel is accepted, the first information report dated
15.04.2022 is manifestly incompetent. However, that first information report is not
subject matter of this writ petition.
The embargo under Section 4 as to who can lodge a first information report regarding
an offence under Section 3 of the Act is absolute. The impugned first information
report has been lodged by the person, who claims to be a victim of conversion
obtained by mis-representation, coercion and allurement and as per Section 4I is the
person competent to lodge the first information report.
Section 5(1), which has also been invoked only provides the punishment for an
offence under Section 3 of the Act. Therefore, it has to be held that the first
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
15
information report impugned in the instant writ petition is by a competent person
and contains ingredients of a cognizable offence.
The various categories of person enumerated in Section 4, who are competent to
lodge the first information report are any aggrieved person. The words “any
aggrieved person” at the very start of the said section can be interpreted to mean any
person, especially since there is no provision under the I.P.C. or Cr.P.C., which bars
or prohibits any person from lodging a first information report regarding cognizable
offence. However, the words “any aggrieved person” in our considered opinion is
qualified by the subsequent categories and the words his, her parents, brother, sisters
or blood relations by marriage and adoption included. Therefore, the words “any
aggrieved person”, if taken by themselves are extremely wide. The scope of the said
term is completely whittled down by subsequent categories and therefore, it has to be
said that any aggrieved person would be a person but is personally aggrieved by his or
her fraudulent conversion be it an individual or in a mass conversion ceremony. Any
interpretation to the contrary would render the remainder of Section 4 after the
words “any aggrieved person “ wholly redundant and also render the Section itself
completely meaningless.
Under the said circumstances, we are constrained to rule that the first information
report dated 15.04.2022 was not lodged by a competent person. Since, the first
information report dated 15.04.2022 had not been lodged by a person competent to
lodge it, it is of no consequence. For the same reason, the impugned first information
report cannot be called a second first information report. It the refore, cannot be said
that there are two separate first information reports of the same incident. The case at
hand therefore, is not covered by the ratio in K.K. Anthony (supra).
It has already been observed in the earlier part of this order that the allegations in the first
information report impugned, contain ingredients of a cognizable offence. Therefore, also the
impugned first information report is not liable to be quashed.”
24. The Criminal Appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 10555/2024 arises from the impugned
judgment dated 17.02.2023 passed by the High Court in the Criminal Misc. Writ Petition No. 2375
of 2023 wherein the appellant before us had sought quashing of FIR No. 55/2023 on the ground
that being a music teacher, he was merely performing as a professional at the place of the alleged
incident and as such had no role to play in the commission of the alleged offences. However, the
High Court dismissed the petition on the ground that the prima facie reading of the FIR disclosed
serious allegations of widespread consequences on the society which required thorough
investigation including the possibility of requirement for custodial interrogation.
25. Finally, the SLP (Crl.) No. 8615 of 2024 arises from the impugned judgment dated 29.04.2024
passed by the High Court in the Misc. Application No. 13099 of 2024 by which the application of the
Petitioner filed under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. seeking to quash the entire proceedings of the S.T.
No. 905/2024 arising out of FIR No. 538/2023 registered under Sections 307, 504, 386 of the IPC
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
16
respectively and Sections 3 and 5(1) of the UP Conversion Act respectively was dismissed on the
ground that a prima facie case was made out against the Petitioner from a bare reading of the FIR
and thus the guidelines laid down by this Court in a catena of decisions did not permit the quashing
of proceedings against the Petitioner.
C. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
26. Mr. Siddharth Dave, the learned Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of the Petitioners in W.P.
(Crl.) No. 123/2023 made the following submissions:
a. A plain reading of the FIR fails to disclose any cognizable offence. He submitted
that neither the Petitioners were named in FIR No. 224/2022, which is the first FIR
lodged in respect of the alleged incident dated 14.04.2022, nor was it alleged that
they were present at the place of the alleged incident.
b. The subsequent FIRs, i.e., FIR Nos. 54/2023, 55/2023 and 60/2023 respectively were registered
for the very same incident for which FIR No. 224/2022 had already been lodged, however, there was
a delay of more than nine months in the registration of the subsequent FIRs. Further, the
subsequent FIRs pertaining to the very same alleged incident of conversion are hit by the dictum
laid by this Court in T.T. Antony (supra) and Babubhai and Ors. v. State of Gujarat & Ors. reported
in (2010) 12 SCC 254 respectively.
c. Although FIR No. 47/2023 pertains to the incident dated 25.12.2021, having been lodged after an
inordinate delay of 1 year 27 days, yet the same is also liable to be quashed in lieu of the principles
laid down in Mohammad Wajid & Anr. v. State of U.P. & Ors. reported in (2023) SCC OnLine SC
951.
d. The offences under Sections 153A, 506 and 120-B of the IPC respectively cannot be said to be
made out against the Petitioners who were not present at the place of incident and there is no
evidence, direct or circumstantial, to establish that a conspiracy was hatched by the Petitioners and
the other accused persons to commit the alleged offences.
e. Section 4 of the unamended U.P. Conversion Act mandates that only the specified classes of
persons can file an FIR under the U.P. Conversion Act. However, as the complainant in FIR No.
224/2022 is not a person falling within one of the specified classes, the FIR fails to meet with the
tenor of the law and is liable to be quashed on this ground alone.
f. The High Court of Allahabad has held in Jose Papachen & Another v. State of Uttar Pradesh
reported in (2023) SCC OnLine All 804 that the scope of the term “any aggrieved person” appearing
in the unamended Section 4 of the U.P. Conversion Act is restricted by the subsequent categories
and any interpretation to the contrary would render the provision meaningless.
g. The plenary and residuary powers of this Court under Articles 32, 136 and 142 of the constitution
respectively are broad enough for the purpose of quashing of the criminal proceedings before any
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
17
court with a view to prevent the abuse of process of law. He placed reliance on the decision in Delhi
Judicial Service Association, Tis Hazari Court, Delhi v. State of Gujarat and Others reported in
(1991) 4 SCC 406 to fortify his submission.
h. Mass conversion has not been made a distinct offence and there is no precise provision in the U.P.
Conversion Act defining mass conversion.
i. The complainant in FIR No. 47/2023 has stated that he reconverted himself to Hinduism and thus
as per Section 3(2) of the U.P. Conversion Act, such a person would not be covered by the U.P.
Conversion Act once he reconverts to his immediate previous religion. j. In the last, he submitted
that the settled legal position is that the mere filing of the chargesheet does not take away the power
of the High Court to quash the entire proceedings emanating from the FIR, and in such
circumstances, he prayed for the quashing of FIR Nos. 224/2022, 47/2023, 54/2023, 55/2023 and
60/2023 respectively and all the subsequent proceedings emanating therefrom.
27. Mr. Vairawan A.S. appeared on behalf of the appellant in Criminal Appeals arising out of the SLP
(Crl.) No. 13679/2023, the SLP (Crl.) No. 10555/2024 and the Petitioner in W.P. (Crl.) No.
315/2024 respectively and submitted as follows:
a. The case of the appellant/petitioner is different from the other co-
accused persons as he is a musician and was just performing at the event in which the
alleged conversion took place. Thus, his presence was purely in his professional
capacity and in lieu of monetary consideration.
b. No specific role has been attributed to the appellant/petitioner in the FIRs and the
chargesheets.
c. The appellant/petitioner professes Hindu religion and even if the allegations in the
FIRs and the chargesheets are taken at their face value, no offence is made out
against him.
d. This Court in a plethora of its decisions has held that omnibus allegations, in the
absence of any specific and active involvement of the accused, are not sufficient to
proceed against the person in criminal proceedings.
28. Ms. Mukta Gupta, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant in Criminal
Appeals arising out of SLP (Crl.) Nos. 7233-7235/2023, submitted as follows:
a. The appellant was not named in the first FIR, i.e., FIR No. 224/2022, however, he
was named as an accused in the chargesheet filed after completion of the
investigation in the said FIR. Further, he also came to be named as an accused person
in the subsequent FIRs filed pertaining to the incident dated 14.04.2022.
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
18
b. By placing strong reliance on the decision in Babubhai (supra), she submitted that
the subsequent FIRs satisfy the test of sameness as they pertain to the same incident
and are thus liable to be quashed.
c. The scheme of Cr.P.C. doesn’t allow a subsequent FIR to be registered for the very
same incident as only the information earliest in point of time is relevant for the
purpose of Section 154 of the Cr.P.C. If there is an attempt to file a second FIR based
on the very same incident, the same must be treated as a statement under Section 161
of the Cr.P.C.
d. The subsequent FIRs could be said to have been lodged with the mala fide
intention of overcoming the lacunae in the filing of the first FIR, i.e., FIR No.
224/2022, which was lodged on the basis of a complaint made by a person not
competent to make the same under the unamended Section 4 of the U.P. Conversion
Act.
e. The complainants in FIR Nos. 54 and 55 of 2023 respectively have in their Section
161 police statements recorded during the course of the investigation into FIR No.
224/2022 categorically stated that they had accompanied the complainant in FIR No.
224/2022 on the day of the alleged incident, indicating that the said persons were not
victims of alleged illegal conversion but were instead accompanying the complainant
in FIR No. 224/2022 to the church on 14.04.2022. The complainants in FIR Nos. 54
and 55 respectively have also stated in their statements recorded on 15.04.2022 that
the persons undergoing conversion were stealthily sent back through the back door of
the Church, thereby indicating that they themselves were not victims of the alleged
conversion.
f. The recording by the Police in the Case Diary dated 14.04.2022 indicates that none
of the victims of the alleged conversion were traceable and no incriminating
documents were found from the Church, thereby indicating that the complainants in
FIR Nos. 54 and 55 respectively, who gave statements under Section 161 were not
victims of the alleged incident.
g. Although the complainants in FIR Nos. 54, 55 and 60 of 2023 respectively
expressed fear to their lives as the reason for the delay in the lodging of the FIR, yet
the same cannot be accepted as credible as all of them gave statements under Section
161 of the CrPC. during the investigation in FIR No. 224/2022.
29. Mr. Siddharth Agarwal, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant(s) in Criminal
Appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) Nos. 7380/2023 and 15251-15254/2023 respectively, adopted and
re-emphasised on the submissions referred to above. He further submitted that the appellant no. 1
in the Criminal Appeals arising out of the SLP (Crl.) Nos. 15251-15254 suffers from a medical
condition termed as cerebral palsy and has been issued a 70% disability certificate. Thus, he could
not be said to have the mental capability to commit the alleged offence. It was further submitted that
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
19
the appellant nos. 3 and 4 in the same set of appeals are not practicing Christians, but are followers
of the Valmiki Samaj, who were working as sweepers and cleaners at the Church on the date of the
alleged incident, i.e., 14.04.2022.
30. Ms. Rebecca John, the learned Senior Counsel appeared for the appellant(s) in Criminal Appeals
arising out of SLP (Crl.) Nos. 3818/2023 and 10187/2023 respectively and Mr. C.U. Singh, the
learned Senior Counsel, appeared for the appellant(s) in Criminal Appeals arising out of SLP (Crl.)
Nos. 13231- 13232/2023. Both the learned counsel adopted and re-iterated the legal arguments
referred to above on the aspect of impermissibility of multiplicity of the FIRs, illegality of FIR No.
224/2022 for having been lodged by a person incompetent to complain and mala fide nature of
criminal proceedings against the Petitioners among others.
D. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH
31. Shri R. Venkataramani, the learned Attorney General for India, appeared on behalf of the State
of Uttar Pradesh and broadly submitted as follows:
a. The Petitioners could not have directly come before this Court seeking the
quashing of FIR Nos. 224/2022 and 47/2023 respectively without first approaching
the jurisdictional High Court. No exceptional circumstances have been made out to
invoke Article 32 and thus, the Writ Petitions seeking the quashing of the said FIRs
are not maintainable. He further submitted that even if the Writ Petitions are held to
be maintainable, the same should not be entertained in light of the observations of
this Court in Arnab Ranjan Goswami v. Union of India, reported in (2020) 14 SCC 12.
b. The Petitioners have filed the present writ petitions with the oblique motive to
indirectly challenge the vires of the U.P. Conversion Act.
However, as per the settled position of law, the vires of a statute cannot be challenged
without specific pleadings in that regard and averments to that effect, and thus the
petitions deserve to be dismissed at the outset. He further submitted that the vires of
the U.P. Conversion Act is already a subject matter of challenge in the W.P. (Crl.) No.
428/2020 and connected W.P. (C) No. 40/2023 and thus the present batch of
petitions do not deserve to be entertained.
c. The FIRs forming the subject matter of challenge in the present batch of petitions
disclose the commission of a cognizable offence as the clear allegations are that
around 90 persons belonging to the Hindu religion were being converted en-masse to
Christianity at the Evangelical Church of India, Hariharganj, Fatehpur on
14.04.2022, by use of fraud, cheating, force and coercion and the documents
belonging to such persons were also being tampered with. He submitted that such
conversion from one religion to another squarely contravenes Section 3(1) of the U.P.
Conversion Act and is punishable under Section 5 of the said Act. In addition to the
said offence being made out, the fraudulent tampering with the documents belonging
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
20
to the persons who were being converted clearly amounts to forgery under Sections
467 and 468 of the IPC respectively. In such circumstances, he submitted that, the
registration of FIR No. 224/2022 for the offence under Sections 153-A, 506, 420,
467, 468 of the IPC respectively and Section(s) 3 and 5(1) of the U.P. Conversion Act
respectively cannot be said to suffer from any infirmity. According to him the police
was under a legal obligation to register FIR as per the mandate of Section 154(1) of
the CrPC and investigate the offence.
d. FIR No. 47/2023, lodged by one of the victims of unlawful religious conversion,
discloses commission of offence under Sections 3 and 5(1) of the U.P. Conversion Act
respectively. Similarly, adverting to the allegations levelled in FIR Nos. 54/2023,
55/2023 and 60/2023 respectively, he submitted that the same discloses commission
of cognizable offences under the IPC as well as the U.P. Conversion Act respectively.
e. Since the investigation in the FIRs in question has culminated into filing of
chargesheets, examining the FIRs alone for the purpose of determining whether they
are liable to be quashed without looking into the contents of the chargesheet would
be misconceived.
f. On the issue of scope and purport of the unamended Section 4 of the U.P.
Conversion Act, the learned AG submitted that the general principle of criminal law
is that the investigation of an offence can be triggered by any credible information
emanating from any source and thus notwithstanding the unamended Section 4 of
the U.P. Conversion Act, the investigation relating to the offences under the U.P.
Conversion Act and connected offences under the IPC can be undertaken with or
without complaints made under Section 4 of the U.P. Conversion Act.
g. The object of the unamended Section 4 was only to recognise the special locus of
certain class of people to complain of the offences defined under the U.P. Conversion
Act, and it was not in any way meant to restrict the ambit of the provision only to the
specified classes of persons. He emphasised on the fact that illegality is by reason of
the breach of the law and should be treated as independent of who informs.
He further submitted that as distinguished from injunctive provisions which limit
cognizance of an offence except in accordance with the stipulated procedure, Section
4 is not injunctive but enabling in nature, and not in derogation of the general
provisions of law.
h. Having regard to the social importance of administration of criminal justice it
must be said that any process which can trigger it must be open, and any limitations
imposed thereon may be unwise.
i. Highlighting the relationship between the U.P. Conversion Act and the Cr.P.C.
respectively, he submitted that except for Section 7, which provides that the offences
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
21
defined under the U.P. Conversion Act shall be cognizable, non-bailable and triable
by Court of Sessions, the U.P. Conversion Act does not override the general
provisions of Cr.P.C. but rather supplements and complements it. Thus, the
operation of Section 154 of the Cr.P.C. pertaining to the power of the police officer to
receive information relating to the commission of cognizable offence from an
informant and register the FIR and thereafter investigate any cognizable case in
exercise of powers conferred upon him by 156(1) Cr.P.C. is not controlled by Section 4
of the U.P. Conversion Act at all.
j. The construction of Section 4 of the U.P. Conversion Act as sought to be done by the Petitioners,
would give rise to an anomalous situation where even though an informant has given the
information regarding commission of cognizable offence under the UP Conversion Act, yet the
Police would not be able to proceed with the registration of the FIR under Section 154(1) of the
Cr.P.C. and consequently investigate into the commission of the cognizable offences till the victim or
his family or friend lodges the FIR.
k. The offences as alleged in FIR Nos. 54/2023, 55/2023 and 60/2023 respectively are distinct
offences and thus, separate FIRs were rightly registered for each of those offences.
l. The learned AG also extensively referred to the contents of the Case Diary including the
statements of witnesses recorded under Sections 161 and 164 of the Cr.P.C. respectively and the
details of recoveries made during the course of the investigation to submit that the material
available on record was sufficient to indicate that the offences alleged in the FIRs under
consideration have been committed by the accused persons, and thus, the FIRs do not warrant
quashing. m. Except for material of sterling quality, no other material in the form of defence could
be relied upon to quash the criminal proceedings. In the present case, no such material of sterling
and impeccable quality has been produced by the Petitioners.
n. In the last, the learned AG submitted with lot of vehemence that unlawful conversions,
particularly those involving the exploitation of vulnerable groups, tend to violate constitutional
morality and undermine the human autonomy and dignity. He underscored that such offences are,
therefore, grave and tend to put the social order and security in jeopardy. Thus, he humbly urged
that the petitions/appeals may be dismissed there being no merit worth the name.
E. ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION
32. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having gone through the
materials on record, the following key issues fall for our consideration:
a. Whether FIR No. 224/2022, having been lodged by a person not falling within one
of the categories specified in the unamended Section 4 of the U.P. Conversion Act, is
liable to be quashed on that ground alone?
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
22
b. Whether FIR Nos. 55/2023 and 60/2023 respectively could be said to be covered
by the decision of this Court in T.T. Antony (supra) and thus are liable to be quashed?
c. Whether the High Court committed any error in declining to quash FIR No.
54/2023?
d. Whether this Court, in exercise of its writ jurisdiction under Article 32, should
quash FIR Nos. 224/2022 and 47/2023 respectively, more particularly when they are
being questioned for the first time before this Court and have not been challenged
before the High Court?
e. Whether the High Court committed any error in declining to quash the
proceedings emanating out of FIR No. 538/2023?
F. ANALYSIS
33. A perusal of the judgments of the High Court impugned before us and discussed
in the preceding paragraphs would go to show that there are three categories of cases
which were dealt with by the High Court and have also come up before us in the
present batch of matters:
a. First, the matters pertaining to FIR No. 54/2023, wherein the High Court declined
to quash the FIR inter alia on the ground that as FIR No. 224/2022 was not lodged at
the instance of a person competent to lodge a complaint under the unamended
Section 4 of the U.P. Conversion Act, the same would constitute as the first FIR in
relation to the alleged incident dated 14.04.2022. Thus, the principles of T.T. Antony
(supra) were not made applicable, and the court declined to quash the FIR.
b. Secondly, the matters pertaining to FIR No. 55/2023, wherein the High Court
declined to quash the FIR inter alia on the ground that the allegations levelled in the
FIR prima facie disclosed the commission of a cognizable offence, and that similar
petitions challenging the same or similar FIRs had already been dismissed by
coordinate benches.
c. Thirdly, the matters pertaining to FIR No. 60/2023 which were dismissed by the
High Court primarily for the very same reasons on which FIR No. 55/2023 was
declined to be quashed by the High Court.
Lastly, one matter pertains to the quashing of FIR No. 538 of 2023. This FIR is no
way connected with the alleged incident which forms the subject matter of FIR Nos.
54, 55 and 60 of 2023 respectively.
34. It is noteworthy that besides the aforesaid three categories of cases, FIR No.
224/2022 and FIR No. 47/2023 respectively have come up for our consideration for
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
23
the first time in exercise of our writ jurisdiction.
35. At the outset, we deem it necessary to point out a peculiarity that pervades a few
of the impugned judgments of the High Court. While we are yet to test the reasoning
employed by the High Court as regards whether FIR No. 54/20223 could be said to
be the first FIR pertaining to the alleged incident dated 14.04.2022 in light of FIR No.
224/2022, what is strikingly strange is that while acknowledging that the contents of
FIR Nos. 55/2023 and 60/2023 respectively bear striking similarities with the
contents of FIR No. 54/2023 and also that the same pertain to the very same incident
as alleged in FIR No. 54/2023, the High Court failed to apply the principles laid
down by this Court in T.T. Antony (supra) to the said FIRs on the patently incorrect
reasoning that a coordinate bench of the High Court had already upheld the validity
of FIR No. 54/2023 as being the first FIR pertaining to the alleged incident.
Even if it could be said that FIR No. 54/2023 was the first FIR as FIR No. 224/2022 was non-est, we
fail to understand how FIR Nos. 55/2023 and 60/2023 respectively would not amount to
subsequent FIRs despite bearing such striking similarities with FIR No. 54/22.
36. Although we propose to independently apply our minds to ascertain whether FIR Nos. 55/2023
and 60/2023 respectively would be covered by the decision in T.T. Antony (supra) yet we fail to
understand as to how the maintainability of FIR No. 54/2023 could have been a valid ground for the
High Court to hold FIR Nos. 55 and 60 of 2023 respectively as valid, despite acknowledging that the
same were mere subsequent FIRs pertaining to the very same alleged incident.
37. We also deem it necessary to clarify at the outset that we concur with the submission of the
learned AG that there is no challenge to the constitutional validity of the U.P. Conversion Act in the
present batch of matters and the issue which concerns us is limited to the validity of the impugned
FIRs and the consequent proceedings arising therefrom. We are aware of the proceedings pending
before this Court wherein the constitutional validity of the U.P. Conversion Act is being looked into.
Thus, any discussion that we undertake as regards the scheme and provisions of the U.P. Conversion
Act would only be with a view to augment our understanding of the matter before us.
38. We also wish to underscore that the learned AG has vehemently submitted as regards the gravity
and seriousness of the act of unlawful and illegal religious conversions and their apparent conflict
with the fundamental tenets of constitutional morality. However, as the present batch of matters
relates to specific FIRs, it would be necessary to examine the same applying the settled and
established legal principles governing the quashing of the FIRs and the findings arrived at as a result
thereto may not have a bearing with the seriousness of the offences alleged, so long as it is not one of
the principles governing the inherent powers of the court to quash the criminal proceedings.
39. Before adverting to the rival submissions canvassed on either side, we deem it necessary to
briefly discuss the scheme of the U.P. Conversion Act. i. Scheme of the U.P. Conversion Act
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
24
40. The U.P. Conversion Act, which came to be enacted in 2021, was preceded by the Uttar Pradesh
Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020. The same was promulgated by the
Governor on 27.11.2020. Shortly thereafter, the ordinance, upon receiving the approval of the State
Legislature and the assent of the Governor, came to be enacted on 04.03.2021.
41. The Preamble to the U.P. Conversion Act, 2021 states the avowed objective of the legislation to
be prohibition of unlawful conversion from one religion to another by misrepresentation, force,
undue influence, coercion, allurement or by any fraudulent means or by marriage.
42. The Statement of Objects and Reasons accompanying the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful
Conversion of Religion Bill, 2021, inter alia stated that the objective of the legislation is to give
meaningful effect to the constitutionally guaranteed right of religious freedom by ensuring that
gullible persons are not converted from one religion to another by use of misrepresentation, force,
undue influence, coercion, allurement or fraudulent means.
43. Allurement, which has been given a non-exhaustive definition, has been defined to include the
following offers of temptation:
a. Any gift, gratification, easy money or material benefit either in cash or kind.
b. Employment, free education in reputed school run by any religious body.
c. Better lifestyle, divine displeasure or otherwise.
44. Section 3 prohibits the conversion from one religion to another by misrepresentation, force,
fraud, undue influence, coercion or allurement. It also prohibits the attempt and abetment to
undertake such conversion. It further provides that no person shall convince or conspire such
conversion. The Explanation to Sub-section (1) of Section 3 provides that conversion by way of
solemnization of marriage or a relationship in the form of marriage would be covered within the
meaning of unlawful conversion if it is on account of the grounds enumerated in Sub-section (1).
45. Section 4, which is crucial to the case at hand, specifies the categories of persons who are
competent to lodge a First Information Report pertaining to the contravention of the provisions of
the U.P. Conversion Act. The said Section was amended in 2024 by the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of
Unlawful Conversion of Religion (Amendment) Act, 2024 (for short, “the Amendment Act, 2024”).
Before the said amendment, Section 4 stood thus:
“4. Person competent to lodge First Information Report.—Any aggrieved person,
his/her parents, brother, sister, or any other person who is related to him/her by
blood, marriage or adoption may lodge a First Information Report of such conversion
which contravenes the provisions of Section 3.”
46. However, after the amendment, Section 4 reads thus:
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
25
“4. Person competent to lodge First Information Report.—An information relating to
the contravention of the provisions of the Act may be given by any person and the
manner of giving such information shall be the same as given in Chapter XIII of the
Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (Act 46 of 2023).”
47. The Statement of Objects and Reasons accompanying the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful
Conversion of Religion (Amendment) Bill, 2024, inter alia, stated that amendment of the Section 4
of the U.P. Conversion Act was necessitated for resolving certain difficulties that had arisen in
various cases in the past as regards the interpretation of Section 4 of the said Act.
48. The State Legislature seems to have taken the decision of amending Section 4, to make it more
expansive, in light of a few decisions of the High Court, including a few impugned before us, wherein
the High Court had raised questions on the validity and legality of FIR No. 224/2022 which was
lodged at the instance of a person not specified as a competent person under the unamended
Section 4 of the U.P. Conversion Act.
49. Besides amending Section 4, the Amendment Act, 2024 also amended Section 7 of the U.P.
Conversion Act, 2021 by introducing a mandatory requirement of providing an opportunity to the
Public Prosecutor to oppose the bail application of a person accused of an offence under the said
Act. The Amendment Act, 2024 also substantially amended Section 5 of the said Act by enhancing
the punishment for contravention of the provisions of the U.P. Conversion Act, 2021 and by
introducing special provisions in respect of minors and members of the Scheduled Castes or the
Scheduled Tribes, besides introducing provisions for compensation and rehabilitation of the victims.
50. Section 6 provides that any marriage done for the sole purpose of unlawful conversion shall be
void. Section 7, inter alia, prescribes that the offences under the U.P. Conversion Act, 2021 shall be
cognizable and non-bailable, and be triable by the Court of Sessions.
51. Section(s) 8 and 9 respectively deal with the statutory requirement and procedure for pre and
post conversion respectively. Sub-section (1) of Section 8 introduces the requirement of
pre-conversion declaration by mandating it for a person who desires to convert his religion to make
a declaration to the prescribed authority in the form prescribed in the first Schedule, at least sixty
days before the date of proposed conversion, to the effect that he wishes to convert his religion on
his own and with his free consent and without any force, coercion, undue influence or allurement.
Further, under Sub-section (2) the person who performs the ceremony for religious conversion,
termed as a ‘religious converter’, is also required to give one month’s advance notice in the form
prescribed in Second Schedule to the prescribed authority. Once such information is received by the
prescribed authority, the said authority is required under Sub-section (3) to direct the police to
conduct an enquiry with a view to find out the real intention, purpose and cause of the proposed
religious conversion. Sub-section (4) stipulates that any contravention of the procedure prescribed
under Sub-sections (1) and (2) would have the effect of rendering the proposed conversion illegal
and void. Sub-section (5) further makes the contravention of the requirement under Sub-section (1)
punishable with imprisonment upto three years and a fine of minimum Rs 10,000/-. Similarly, the
contravention of the requirement under Sub-section (2) is made punishable with imprisonment

26
upto five years and a fine of minimum Rs 25,000/-.
52. Section 9 provides that a person who has converted his religion must send a declaration to the
prescribed authority within sixty days from the date of conversion in the form prescribed in the
third Schedule to the U.P. Conversion Act. Sub-section (2) prescribes that upon receiving such a
declaration, the prescribed authority shall exhibit a copy of the declaration on the notice board of his
office, till the date of confirmation. Sub-section (3) prescribes the particulars to be disclosed at the
time of making the declaration required under Sub-section (1) and includes the permanent address,
place of residence, nature of process gone through for conversion, etc. Sub-section (4) requires the
convert to appear before the prescribed authority within 21 days of sending the declaration to
establish his identity and confirm the contents of the declaration. Sub-section (7) stipulates that the
contravention of Sub-sections (1) to (4) shall render the conversion illegal and void.
53. Section 10 provides for the punishment in cases where the provisions of the Act, 2021 are
violated by an institution or organization and stipulates that the persons in charge of the affairs of
such an organization shall be liable to be punished under Section 5 of the Act, 2021. Further, the
registration of such an organization or institution under any law for the time being in force may be
liable to be cancelled by the competent authority upon reference made by the prescribed authority.
54. Section 11 defines who shall be considered as parties to the offences committed under the Act,
2021. Section 12 stipulates that the burden of proof as regards whether religious conversion was
effected lawfully and in accordance with the provisions of the U.P. Conversion Act, 2021 shall lie on
the person who caused such conversion. Section 13 is the difficulty removal clause and empowers
the State Government to make provisions to remove any difficulty arising in giving effect to the
provisions of the Act, for a period of upto two years. Section 14 empowers the State Government to
make Rules for carrying out the provisions of the Act. Section 15 is the repeal and saving clause and
repeals the 2020 Ordinance, while saving any actions taken thereunder.
55. As discussed earlier, the constitutional validity of the provisions of the U.P. Conversion Act does
not fall for our consideration in the instant case. Nonetheless, we can’t help but observe that the
provisions of the said Act pertaining to the pre and post-conversion declaration seem to introduce a
very onerous procedure to be followed by an individual seeking to adopt a faith other than the one
he professes. The involvement and interference of the State authorities in the conversion procedure
is also conspicuous, with the District Magistrate having been legally obliged to direct a police
enquiry in each case of intended religious conversion. Further, the statutory requirement of making
public the personal details of each person who has converted to a different religion may require a
deeper examination to ascertain if such a requirement fits well with the privacy regime pervading
the constitution.
56. In the preamble to the Constitution of India the words ‘SOCIALIST SECULAR’ were inserted by
the Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act, 1976. The secular nature of India is an intrinsic part of the
‘basic structure’ of the Constitution, as held in Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalvaru v. State of
Kerala reported in AIR 1973 SC 1461. As laid down in the Preamble, the People of India, have
resolved to secure to all its citizens, liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship, apart
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
27
from Justice, social, economic and political; Equality of status and of opportunity and to promote
among them all fraternity, assuring the dignity of the individual, and the unity and integrity of the
Nation. It requires no further exposition that the Preamble to the Constitution is of extreme
importance and the Constitution should be read and interpreted in the light of the noble and grand
vision expressed in the Preamble.
57. The People of India are given the liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship. This
liberty is an embodiment and expression of the secular nature of the country. Article 25 lays down
that all persons are equally entitled to have the freedom of conscience and shall have the right to
profess, practise and propagate religion, which are subject to public order, morality and health and
the other provisions of Part III of the Constitution. The right conferred by Article 25 does not
prevent the State from making any law, regulating or restricting any secular activity which may be
associated with religious practice, providing for social welfare and reform.
58. The scope of Article 25 fell for consideration of this Court in Ratilal Panachand Gandhi v. State
of Bombay reported in AIR 1954 SC 388. It was held therein that Article 25 of the Constitution
guarantees to every person, and not merely to the citizens of India, the freedom of conscience and
the right to freely profess, practise and propagate religion. Subject to the restrictions which Article
25 imposes, every person has a fundamental right under our Constitution, not merely to entertain
such religious belief as may be approved of by his judgment or conscience, but to exhibit his belief
and ideas in such overt acts, as are enjoined or sanctioned by his religion and further to propagate
his religious views for his edification of others. The free exercise of religion, by which is meant the
performance of outward acts in pursuance of religious belief, is subject of course, to State regulation
imposed to secure order, public health and morals of the people. The Court once again observed that
our Constitution makers have made no attempt to define what ‘religion’ is and that it is not certainly
possible to frame an exhaustive definition of the word ‘religion’ which would be applicable to all
classes of persons. It was once again reiterated that religious practices or performances of acts in
pursuance of religious belief, are as much a part of religion as faith or belief in particular doctrines.
59. In Saifuddin Saheb v. State of Bombay, reported in AIR 1962 SC 853, Raigopala Ayyangar, J.,
while dealing with Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution observed:
“I would add that these articles embody the principle of religious toleration that has
been the characteristic feature of Indian civilization from the start of history, the
instances and periods when this feature was absent being merely temporary
aberrations. Besides, they serve to emphasize the secular nature of Indian Democracy
which the founding fathers considered should be the very basis of the Constitution.”
60. As observed in the Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras v. Sri Lakshmindra
Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt reported in AIR 1954 SC 282, the word ‘religion’ is not defined
in the Constitution. The Court concluded that religion is certainly a matter of faith with individuals
or communities.

61. A nine-Judge Bench of this Court in K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India reported in (2017) 10
SCC 1, recognised the right to privacy as a facet of Article 21 of the Constitution. Touching upon the
interplay between privacy and the right to freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and
propagation of religion, this Court underlined that Article 25 encapsulates within it the ability to
choose a faith and the subsequent freedom to express or not to express such choice. In other words,
Article 25 carries with it the facets of privacy rights, whereby the person has the intrinsic right to
freedom of conscience and also the choice to express it to the world at large. This Court highlighted
that although Part III of the Constitution does not have a separate Article declaring privacy as a
fundamental right, yet the broader scheme of Part III portrays and contains in it the various aspects
of privacy, Article 25 being one of them. The Court categorically noted that the freedom of
conscience as ensured under Article 25 falls within the zone of purely private thought process. It was
also emphasised that privacy is a condition precedent for the rights under Article 25 to come into
being. This Court also read privacy rights in other rights pertaining to religious belief under Articles
26 and 28 respectively. Some of the relevant observations made in the said decision are as follows:
“298.[…]The constitutional right to the freedom of religion under Article 25 has
implicit within it the ability to choose a faith and the freedom to express or not
express those choices to the world. These are some illustrations of the manner in
which privacy facilitates freedom and is intrinsic to the exercise of liberty. The
Constitution does not contain a separate article telling us that privacy has been
declared to be a fundamental right. Nor have we tagged the provisions of Part III with
an alpha-suffixed right to privacy : this is not an act of judicial redrafting. Dignity
cannot exist without privacy. Both reside within the inalienable values of life, liberty
and freedom which the Constitution has recognised. Privacy is the ultimate
expression of the sanctity of the individual. It is a constitutional value which
straddles across the spectrum of fundamental rights and protects for the individual a
zone of choice and self-determination.
xxx
372. […] Insofar as religious beliefs are concerned, a good deal of the misery our
species suffer owes its existence to and centres around competing claims of the right
to propagate religion. Constitution of India protects the liberty of all subjects
guaranteeing [ …] the freedom of conscience and right to freely profess, practise and
propagate religion. While the right to freely “profess, practise and propagate religion”
may be a facet of free speech guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a), the freedom of the
belief or faith in any religion is a matter of conscience falling within the zone of
purely private thought process and is an aspect of liberty. There are areas other than
religious beliefs which form part of the individual's freedom of conscience such as
political belief, etc. which form part of the liberty under Article 21.

413. Ex facie, privacy is essential to the exercise of freedom of conscience and the
right to profess, practise and propagate religion vide Article 25. The further right of
every religious denomination to maintain institutions for religious and charitable
purposes, to manage its own affairs and to own and administer property acquired for
such purposes vide Article 26 also requires privacy, in the sense of non-interference
from the State. Article 28(3) expressly recognises the right of a student attending an
educational institution recognised by the State, to be left alone. Such a student
cannot be compelled to take part in any religious instruction imparted in any such
institution unless his guardian has consented to it.” (Emphasis supplied)
62. Similarly, on the interplay between privacy and marriage, a three-Judge Bench of this Court in
Shakti Vahini v. Union of India, reported in (2018) 7 SCC 192, while referring to Asha Ranjan v.
State of Bihar, reported in (2017) 4 SCC 397, held that choosing one’s partner is a legitimate
constitutional right. The consent of the family or the community or the clan is not necessary once
two adults agree to enter into a wedlock. The consent of those two adults has to be given primacy as
their choices are manifestation of their right recognized under Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution
respectively. The Court held that the right to choose being an inextricable part of dignity, the
infringement of exercise of such right is a violation of the Constitution. The relevant observations
have been reproduced hereinbelow:-
“43. Honour killing guillotines individual liberty, freedom of choice and one's own
perception of choice. It has to be sublimely borne in mind that when two adults
consensually choose each other as life partners, it is a manifestation of their choice
which is recognised under Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution. Such a right has the
sanction of the constitutional law and once that is recognised, the said right needs to
be protected and it cannot succumb to the conception of class honour or group
thinking which is conceived of on some notion that remotely does not have any
legitimacy.
44. The concept of liberty has to be weighed and tested on the touchstone of
constitutional sensitivity, protection and the values it stands for. It is the obligation of
the constitutional courts as the sentinel on qui vive to zealously guard the right to
liberty of an individual as the dignified existence of an individual has an inseparable
association with liberty. Without sustenance of liberty, subject to constitutionally
valid provisions of law, the life of a person is comparable to the living dead having to
endure cruelty and torture without protest and tolerate imposition of thoughts and
ideas without a voice to dissent or record a disagreement. The fundamental feature of
dignified existence is to assert for dignity that has the spark of divinity and the
realisation of choice within the parameters of law without any kind of subjugation.
The purpose of laying stress on the concepts of individual dignity and choice within
the framework of liberty is of paramount importance. We may clearly and
emphatically state that life and liberty sans dignity and choice is a phenomenon that
allows hollowness to enter into the constitutional recognition of identity of a person.
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025

45. The choice of an individual is an inextricable part of dignity, for dignity cannot be
thought of where there is erosion of choice. True it is, the same is bound by the
principle of constitutional limitation but in the absence of such limitation, none, we
mean, no one shall be permitted to interfere in the fructification of the said choice. If
the right to express one's own choice is obstructed, it would be extremely difficult to
think of dignity in its sanctified completeness. When two adults marry out of their
volition, they choose their path; they consummate their relationship; they feel that it
is their goal and they have the right to do so. And it can unequivocally be stated that
they have the right and any infringement of the said right is a constitutional violation.
The majority in the name of class or elevated honour of clan cannot call for their
presence or force their appearance as if they are the monarchs of some indescribable
era who have the power, authority and final say to impose any sentence and
determine the execution of the same in the way they desire possibly harbouring the
notion that they are a law unto themselves or they are the ancestors of Caesar or, for
that matter, Louis the XIV. The Constitution and the laws of this country do not
countenance such an act and, in fact, the whole activity is illegal and punishable as
offence under the criminal law.” (Emphasis supplied)
63. Again one another three-Judge Bench of this Court in Shafin Jahan v.
Asokan K.M., reported in (2018) 16 SCC 368, highlighted that the Constitution affirms the liberty
and autonomy inherent in every individual, more particularly, to the decisions central to one’s
identity. It held that the right to marry a person of one’s choice is integral to Article 21 of the
Constitution as an expression of one’s right to life. It categorically held that the intimacies of
marriage, including the choices which individuals make on whether to marry, or whom to marry,
form one of the rights from a bouquet of rights of the right to privacy, and most importantly,
transcend the control of the State. The Court while observing that the Constitution guarantees the
right to practice, profess and propagate religion, it held that an individual’s autonomy is supreme in
choices of faith and belief which are intrinsic in matters of marriage. The Court prohibited the State
as well as the law from controlling the choice of choosing a partner or even limiting or regulating the
ability to decide on such matters. We quote the relevant extract:
“84. A marriage can be dissolved at the behest of parties to it, by a competent court of
law. Marital status is conferred through legislation or, as the case may be, custom.
Deprivation of marital status is a matter of serious import and must be strictly in
accordance with law. The High Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under Article
226 ought not to have embarked on the course of annulling the marriage. The
Constitution recognises the liberty and autonomy which inheres in each individual.
This includes the ability to take decisions on aspects which define one's personhood
and identity. The choice of a partner whether within or outside marriage lies within
the exclusive domain of each individual. Intimacies of marriage lie within a core zone
of privacy, which is inviolable. The absolute right of an individual to choose a life
partner is not in the least affected by matters of faith. The Constitution guarantees to
each individual the right freely to practise, profess and propagate religion. Choices of
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025

31
faith and belief as indeed choices in matters of marriage lie within an area where
individual autonomy is supreme. The law prescribes conditions for a valid marriage.
It provides remedies when relationships run aground. Neither the State nor the law
can dictate a choice of partners or limit the free ability of every person to decide on
these matters. They form the essence of personal liberty under the Constitution. In
deciding whether Shafin Jahan is a fit person for Hadiya to marry, the High Court has
entered into prohibited terrain. Our choices are respected because they are ours.
Social approval for intimate personal decisions is not the basis for recognising them.
Indeed, the Constitution protects personal liberty from disapproving audiences.”
(Emphasis supplied)
64. However, the question of validity of the provisions of the U.P. Conversion Act not being in issue,
we would limit our observations to the aforesaid extent and proceed to examine the issues that have
arisen for our consideration.
65. The journey to answering the issues framed above would necessarily have to pass through the
following legal questions:
a. What are the contours of inherent powers of the High Courts insofar as quashing of
criminal proceedings is concerned and what are the principles governing the exercise
of such powers?
b. Whether an FIR can be quashed after the filing of a chargesheet? If yes, is there
any change in the considerations governing quashing in the two cases?
c. Whether this Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction under Article 32 can consider
the prayer for quashing of criminal proceedings?
d. Whether multiple FIRs pertaining to the same alleged offence/incident is maintainable?
ii. Principles governing the quashing of criminal proceedings
66. The power to quash criminal proceedings is guided by the principle of preventing the abuse of
the process of law or miscarriage of justice, and of securing the ends of justice. It can be done by the
High Court in exercise of its extraordinary power under Article 226 of the Constitution or by
exercise of its inherent powers under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. (Section 528 of the Bhartiya Nagarik
Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (for short, “the B.N.S.S.”)) and even by the Supreme Court under Article 32
of the Constitution, if the circumstances so require.
67. Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. stipulates that nothing in the Cr.P.C. limits or affects the inherent
powers of the High Court to make orders to give effect to any order under the Cr.P.C., or to prevent
abuse of the process of any Court, or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. The powers vested can
even be exercised suo motu to secure the ends of justice. In State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, reported
in 1992 Supp (1) 335, this Court made it abundantly clear that the High Courts in exercise of their
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
32
extraordinary power under Article 226 or the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.,
should act with a view to prevent abuse of process of any court or secure the ends of justice. A
three-Judge Bench of this Court in State of Orissa v. Debendra Nath Padhi, reported in (2005) 1 SCC
568, placing reliance on Bhajan Lal (supra), held thus:
“29. Regarding the argument of the accused having to face the trial despite being in a
position to produce material of unimpeachable character of sterling quality, the width
of the powers of the High Court under Section 482 of the Code and Article 226 of the
Constitution is unlimited whereunder in the interests of justice the High Court can
make such orders as may be necessary to prevent abuse of the process of any court or
otherwise to secure the ends of justice within the parameters laid down in Bhajan Lal
case [1992 Supp (1) SCC 335 : 1992 SCC (Cri) 426] .” (Emphasis supplied)
68. In Pepsi Foods Ltd. & Anr. v. Special Judicial Magistrate & Ors., reported in (1998) 5 SCC 749, it
was held by this Court that the nomenclature under which the petition has been filed is not relevant
and it does not bar the court from exercising its jurisdiction which it possesses by virtue of its very
existence. The relevant observations read thus:
“26. Nomenclature under which petition is filed is not quite relevant and that does
not debar the court from exercising its jurisdiction which otherwise it possesses
unless there is special procedure prescribed which procedure is mandatory. If in a
case like the present one the court finds that the appellants could not invoke its
jurisdiction under Article 226, the court can certainly treat the petition as one under
Article 227 or Section 482 of the Code. It may not however, be lost sight of that
provisions exist in the Code of revision and appeal but some time for immediate relief
Section 482 of the Code or Article 227 may have to be resorted to for correcting some
grave errors that might be committed by the subordinate courts. The present petition
though filed in the High Court as one under Articles 226 and 227 could well be
treated under Article 227 of the Constitution.” (Emphasis supplied)
69. A three-Judge Bench of this Court, speaking through Gajendragadkar, J., as His Lordship then
was, in Talab Haji Hussain v. Madhukar Purshottam Mondkar, reported in 1958 SCC OnLine SC 81,
succinctly explained the intention of the legislature behind adding Section 561A to the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1898, which is in pari materia with Section 482 of the Cr.P.C., and Section 528
of the B.N.S.S. The Court held that the provisions of the Code do not limit or affect the inherent
power of the High Court. The legislature cannot anticipate every lacuna that may arise in the
implementation of procedural law and it is precisely to address such lacunas that, the law recognises
the existence of inherent power in courts. The relevant observations read thus:
“5. Section 561-A of the Code was added to the Code in 1923 and it purports to save
the inherent power of the High Courts. It provides that nothing in the Code shall be
deemed to limit or affect the inherent power of the High Court to make such orders
as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Code or to prevent abuse of
the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. It appears that
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
33
doubts were expressed in some judicial decisions about the existence of such inherent
power in the High Courts prior to 1923. That is why legislature enacted this section to
clarify the position that the provisions of the Code were not intended to limit or affect
the inherent power of the High Courts as mentioned in Section 561-A. It is obvious
that this inherent power can be exercised only for either of the three purposes
specifically mentioned in the section. This inherent power cannot naturally be
invoked in respect of any matter covered by the specific provisions of the Code. It
cannot also be invoked if its exercise would be inconsistent with any of the specific
provisions of the Code. It is only if the matter in question is not covered by any
specific provisions of the Code that Section 561-A can come into operation, subject
further to the requirement that the exercise of such power must serve either of the
three purposes mentioned in the said section. In prescribing rules of procedure
legislature undoubtedly attempts to provide for all cases that are likely to arise; but it
is not possible that any legislative enactment dealing with procedure, however
carefully it may be drafted, would succeed in providing for all cases that may possibly
arise in future. Lacunae are sometimes discovered in procedural law and it is to cover
such lacunae and to deal with cases where such lacunae are discovered that
procedural law invariably recognizes the existence of inherent power in courts. It
would be noticed that it is only the High Courts whose inherent power is recognized
by Section 561-A; and even in regard to the High Courts' inherent power definite
salutary safeguards have been laid down as to its exercise. It is only where the High
Court is satisfied either that an order passed under the Code would be rendered
ineffective or that the process of any court would be abused or that the ends of justice
would not be secured that the High Court can and must exercise its inherent power
under Section 561-A. There can thus be no dispute about the scope and nature of the
inherent power of the High Courts and the extent of its exercise.” (Emphasis
supplied)
70. The aforesaid decisions of this Court make it clear that where the High Court is satisfied that the
process of any court is being abused or likely to be abused or that the ends of justice would not be
secured, it is not only empowered but also obligated under the law to exercise its inherent powers.
The provision does not confer any new power on the High Court but rather saves the power which
the High Court already possesses, from before the enactment of the legislation, by reason of its very
existence. In exercise of its power, it would be legitimate for the High Court to quash any criminal
proceedings, if the High Court finds that the initiation or continuation of it may lead to abuse of
process of court, and quashing of the proceedings would serve the ends of justice.
71. While observing that it is not possible to lay down an exhaustive list of circumstances and
situations wherein such inherent power could be exercised, this Court in Bhajan Lal (supra),
nonetheless illustrated certain categories of cases wherein the extraordinary power under Article
226 or the inherent power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. can be exercised by the High Court. We
would like to reproduce paragraph 102 of the said judgment which reads thus:
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/

“102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant provisions of the
Code under Chapter XIV and of the principles of law enunciated by this Court in a
series of decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power under Article
226 or the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code which we have extracted
and reproduced above, we have given the following categories of cases by way of
illustration wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the
process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not be
possible to lay down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelised and
inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds
of cases wherein such power should be exercised.
(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even
if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie
constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused.
(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any,
accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an
investigation by police officers under Section 156(1) of the Code except under an
order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.
(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the
evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any
offence and make out a case against the accused.
(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but
constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police
officer without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the
Code.
(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently
improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion
that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.
(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code
or the concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the
institution and continuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific
provision in the Code or the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the
grievance of the aggrieved party.
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where
the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking
vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal
grudge.” (Emphasis supplied)

72. This Court in Rajiv Thapar v. Madan Lal Kapoor, reported in (2013) 3 SCC 330, laid down steps
that ought to be followed by the High Court to determine the veracity of a prayer for quashing of
proceedings. The steps were premised on the understanding that the courts are not barred from
looking at the materials produced by the accused of sterling and impeccable quality. It was held that
the material should be such as would persuade a reasonable person to reject, dismiss and condemn
the allegations as false. The judicial conscience of the High Court would then be persuaded to
exercise its power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. to quash the proceedings with a view to prevent
abuse of process of the court and secure the ends of justice. The relevant observations have been
reproduced hereinbelow:-
“30. Based on the factors canvassed in the foregoing paragraphs, we would delineate
the following steps to determine the veracity of a prayer for quashment raised by an
accused by invoking the power vested in the High Court under Section 482 CrPC:
30.1. Step one: whether the material relied upon by the accused is sound, reasonable,
and indubitable i.e. the material is of sterling and impeccable quality?
30.2. Step two: whether the material relied upon by the accused would rule out the
assertions contained in the charges levelled against the accused i.e. the material is
sufficient to reject and overrule the factual assertions contained in the complaint i.e.
the material is such as would persuade a reasonable person to dismiss and condemn
the factual basis of the accusations as false?
30.3. Step three: whether the material relied upon by the accused has not been
refuted by the prosecution/complainant; and/or the material is such that it cannot be
justifiably refuted by the prosecution/complainant?
30.4. Step four: whether proceeding with the trial would result in an abuse of process
of the court, and would not serve the ends of justice?
30.5. If the answer to all the steps is in the affirmative, the judicial conscience of the
High Court should persuade it to quash such criminal proceedings in exercise of
power vested in it under Section 482 CrPC. Such exercise of power, besides doing
justice to the accused, would save precious court time, which would otherwise be
wasted in holding such a trial (as well as proceedings arising therefrom) specially
when it is clear that the same would not conclude in the conviction of the accused.”
(Emphasis supplied)
73. While looking into the present matter, we came across many judgments and orders of various
High Courts, more particularly, the High Court of Allahabad, wherein the decision of this Court in
Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra & Ors., reported in (2021) 19 SCC 401,
has been interpreted as curtailing the scope of inherent powers of the High Courts to quash the
criminal proceedings as compared to the scope laid down in Bhajan Lal (supra). We deem it
important to discuss the decision in Neeharika (supra) so as to understand its true import and

whether it has limited the scope of the decision in Bhajan Lal (supra) in any manner.
74. The decision in Neeharika (supra), inter alia, held as follows:-
a. First, the police have the statutory right and duty under the relevant provisions of
the Cr.P.C. to investigate into cognizable offence. As a matter of rule, the courts
should not interfere at the stage of investigation of a cognizable offence, however, in
cases where no cognizable offence is disclosed in the FIR, the court should not permit
an investigation to continue. The power of quashing should be exercised sparingly
with circumspection. The courts should not interfere at the stage of investigation of
offences except where non-
interference would result in miscarriage of justice.
b. Secondly, the decision of Bhajan Lal (supra), in so many words, holds that the
courts should not interfere at the stage of investigation except in cases where
non-interference would result in miscarriage of justice.
The High Courts are well within their jurisdiction to quash an FIR/complaint with
due regard to the restraints imposed by law, more particularly, the parameters laid
down in R.P. Kapur v. State of Punjab, reported in 1960 SCC OnLine SC 21 and
Bhajan Lal (supra).
c. Thirdly, where the initiation of criminal proceedings amounts to an abuse of the process of law, or
in exceptional cases where non- interference would result in a miscarriage of justice, the High Court,
in exercise of its powers under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. and/or Article 226 of the Constitution,
may quash the FIR, complaint, or criminal proceedings, and may even stay the proceedings.
75. In Neeharika (supra), the Court was dealing with the issue whether the High Court would be
justified in passing an interim order either staying the investigation or an order stating that “no
coercive steps” be taken during the investigation. The Court held that the law as regards the exercise
of powers by the High Court to quash an FIR, or a complaint and the parameters applicable for
exercise of such powers in quashing an FIR, or a complaint should be made applicable in the form of
parameters to be applied while considering the grant of interim stay or protection. It is in this
context, and only in this context that the Court reiterated the established principles governing the
exercise of powers under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. and/or under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India.
76. The Court referred to its various other decisions to discuss the scope and ambit of the powers
under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. and Article 226 of the Constitution. In this context, the Court
referred to Bhajan Lal (supra), to state that while identifying the cases in which the FIR/complaint
can be quashed, the High Court should not embark upon an inquiry into the merits and demerits of
the allegations and quash the proceedings. A plain reading of the decisions in Neeharika (supra) and
Bhajan Lal (supra) indicates that both decisions stand in harmony and admit of no contradiction.

77. To resolve the issue in Neeharika (supra), the Court referred to and interpreted the time-tested
principles laid down in the earlier pronouncements of this Court on the scope and ambit of the
powers of the High Court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. and/or Article 226 of the Constitution,
and applied them to the facts of the said case, without in any manner unsettling the settled
principles of law.
78. The decision in Neeharika (supra) by no means should be understood to lay an absolute dictum
that an FIR/complaint cannot be quashed at the stage of investigation. The decision proceeds on the
premise that if an “information” given to the police discloses commission of an offence, then it
requires investigation. However, it does not take away the inherent powers of the High Court, which
are discretionary and are to be exercised judicially upon a careful application of mind to the facts
and the relief sought.
79. Thus, it could be said that the decision in Neeharika (supra) operates in a cautionary domain,
requiring the courts to be circumspect, particularly in cases involving complex or convoluted facts.
The guiding principle remains that this extraordinary jurisdiction should be invoked sparingly, with
due regard to balancing the rights of the genuine complainants vis a vis the innocent persons against
whom the criminal proceedings have been initiated by abusing the process of law.
80. In the context of the decision in the Neeharika (supra), we would like to say that a judgment of a
court of law should not be read as a Euclid’s theorem nor as a provision in a statute, vide Bharat
Petroleum Corpn. Ltd. v. N.R. Vairamani reported in (2008) 8 SCC 579 : AIR 2004 SC 4778 (vide
paras 9 to 12), Rajbir Singh Dalal v. Chaudhari Devi Lal University reported in (2008) 9 SCC 284,
etc.
81. Undoubtedly, if an offence is alleged to have been committed, the police is duty bound to
investigate into the offence. The Cr.P.C. vests this power in police to investigate all cases where it is
suspected or reported that an offence has been committed. However, at the same time, in
appropriate cases an aggrieved person also has a right to seek a remedy before the courts and in a
given case, if the High Court is convinced that the investigation by the police is nothing but an abuse
of the process of law, it can and must quash the FIR or the proceedings arising therefrom, or issue a
writ of mandamus restraining the police officer from misusing his powers.
82. In the State of A.P. v. Golconda Linga Swamy, reported in (2004) 6 SCC 522, this Court
elaborated on the types of material the High Court can take into consideration to quash an FIR. The
Court drew a fine distinction between consideration of materials that may be tendered as evidence
and appreciation of such evidence and that only such material that manifestly runs contrary to the
accusations in the FIR could be considered for the purpose of quashing. The relevant observations
read thus:-
“5.[…] Authority of the court exists for advancement of justice and if any attempt is
made to abuse that authority so as to produce injustice, the court has power to
prevent such abuse. It would be an abuse of the process of the court to allow any
action which would result in injustice and prevent promotion of justice. In exercise of
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
38
the powers court would be justified to quash any proceeding if it finds that initiation
or continuance of it amounts to abuse of the process of court or quashing of these
proceedings would otherwise serve the ends of justice. When no offence is disclosed
by the complaint, the court may examine the question of fact. When a complaint is
sought to be quashed, it is permissible to look into the materials to assess what the
complainant has alleged and whether any offence is made out even if the allegations
are accepted in toto.
6. In R.P. Kapur v. State of Punjab [AIR 1960 SC 866 :
1960 Cri LJ 1239] this Court summarised some categories of cases where inherent
power can and should be exercised to quash the proceedings : (AIR p. 869, para 6)
(i) where it manifestly appears that there is a legal bar against the institution or
continuance e.g. want of sanction;
(ii) where the allegations in the first information report or complaint taken at its face
value and accepted in their entirety do not constitute the offence alleged;
(iii) where the allegations constitute an offence, but there is no legal evidence
adduced or the evidence adduced clearly or manifestly fails to prove the charge.
7. In dealing with the last category, it is important to bear in mind the distinction between a case
where there is no legal evidence or where there is evidence which is clearly inconsistent with the
accusations made, and a case where there is legal evidence which, on appreciation, may or may not
support the accusations. When exercising jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code, the High
Court would not ordinarily embark upon an enquiry whether the evidence in question is reliable or
not or whether on a reasonable appreciation of it accusation would not be sustained. That is the
function of the trial Judge.[…]” (Emphasis supplied)
83. What should be the approach of the court in cases where an accused seeks quashing of an FIR or
proceedings on the ground that such proceedings are manifestly frivolous, or vexatious, or instituted
with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance was delineated by this Court in Mohammad Wajid v.
State of U.P., reported in 2023 SCC OnLine SC 951, wherein one of us, J.B. Pardiwala, J., speaking
for the Bench held that the courts owe a duty to look into other attending circumstances emerging
from the record of the case, and if need be, read between the lines. We may refer to the following
observations for the benefit of exposition:
“36. At this stage, we would like to observe something important. Whenever an
accused comes before the Court invoking either the inherent powers under Section
482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) or extraordinary jurisdiction under
Article 226 of the Constitution to get the FIR or the criminal proceedings quashed
essentially on the ground that such proceedings are manifestly frivolous or vexatious
or instituted with the ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance, then in such
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
39
circumstances the Court owes a duty to look into the FIR with care and a little more
closely.
37. We say so because once the complainant decides to proceed against the accused
with an ulterior motive for wreaking personal vengeance, etc. then he would ensure
that the FIR/complaint is very well drafted with all the necessary pleadings. The
complainant would ensure that the averments made in the FIR/complaint are such
that they disclose the necessary ingredients to constitute the alleged offence.
Therefore, it will not be just enough for the Court to look into the averments made in
the FIR/complaint alone for the purpose of ascertaining whether the necessary
ingredients to constitute the alleged offence are disclosed or not.
38. In frivolous or vexatious proceedings, the Court owes a duty to look into many
other attending circumstances emerging from the record of the case over and above
the averments and, if need be, with due care and circumspection try to read in
between the lines. The Court while exercising its jurisdiction under Section 482CrPC
or Article 226 of the Constitution need not restrict itself only to the stage of a case but
is empowered to take into account the overall circumstances leading to the
initiation/registration of the case as well as the materials collected in the course of
investigation. Take for instance the case on hand. Multiple FIRs have been registered
over a period of time. It is in the background of such circumstances the registration of
multiple FIRs assumes importance, thereby attracting the issue of wreaking
vengeance out of private or personal grudge as alleged.” (Emphasis supplied)
84. Recently, a Coordinate Bench of this Court in Imran Pratapgadhi v. State of Gujarat & Anr.,
reported in 2025 SCC OnLine SC 678, dealt with a case wherein the High Court had rejected the
petition under Section 528 of the B.N.S.S. read with Article 226 of the Constitution by holding that
since the investigation was at a nascent stage, the High Court should not interfere in view of the
decision of this Court in Neeharika (supra). This Court found the registration of the FIR to be a
mechanical exercise and a clear abuse of the process of law as no prima facie case was made out
against the appellant qua the provisions invoked. The Court held that there is no absolute rule that
when the investigation is at a nascent stage, the High Court should not exercise its jurisdiction to
quash an FIR in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution or under Section
482 of the Code. To prevent abuse of the process of law, the High Court may interfere even though
the investigation is at the nascent stage. The relevant observations read thus:-
“36. In the instant case, as we have seen, no prima facie case can be said to have been
made out against the appellant qua the sections invoked. In such a case, registration
of the FIR appears to be a very mechanical exercise and is a clear abuse of the process
of law. In fact, registration of such FIR virtually borders on perversity. We are
surprised that this very crucial aspect escaped the notice of the High Court. The High
Court ought to have nipped the mischief at the threshold itself.
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
40
37. We fail to understand how the High Court concluded that the message was posted
in a manner that would certainly disturb social harmony. Thereafter, the High Court
gave a reason that the investigation was at a nascent stage. There is no absolute rule
that when the investigation is at a nascent stage, the High Court cannot exercise its
jurisdiction to quash an offence by exercising its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India or under Section 482 of the CrPC equivalent to Section 528 of
the BNSS. When the High Court, in the given case, finds that no offence was made
out on the face of it, to prevent abuse of the process of law, it can always interfere
even though the investigation is at the nascent stage. It all depends on the facts and
circumstances of each case as well as the nature of the offence. There is no such
blanket rule putting an embargo on the powers of the High Court to quash FIR only
on the ground that the investigation was at a nascent stage. If such embargo is taken
as an absolute rule, it will substantially curtail the powers of the High Court which
have been laid down and recognised by this Court in the case of State of Haryana v.
Bhajan Lal.” (Emphasis supplied) iii. Whether an FIR can be quashed after the filing
of chargesheet?
85. The learned AG placed considerable emphasis on the fact that since chargesheets in all the
impugned FIRs have already been filed, the plea of the appellant(s)/petitioners for the quashing of
the FIRs is misconceived. The question as to whether an FIR can be quashed after the filing of a
chargesheet is no longer res integra. The High Court, while dealing with a petition seeking quashing
of an FIR, even after the chargesheet had been filed, is well within its powers to do so if, upon a
collective reading of the FIR and the chargesheet, it is satisfied that they do not disclose commission
of any offence or that the continuation of proceedings would amount to an abuse of the process of
law. Thus, the filing of a chargesheet would not preclude the High Court from quashing of the
criminal proceedings. This Court in Anand Kumar Mohatta v. State (NCT of Delhi), reported in
(2019) 11 SCC 706, held thus:-
“14. First, we would like to deal with the submission of the learned Senior Counsel for
Respondent 2 that once the charge-sheet is filed, petition for quashing of FIR is
untenable. We do not see any merit in this submission, keeping in mind the position
of this Court in Joseph Salvaraj A. v. State of Gujarat [Joseph Salvaraj A. v. State of
Gujarat, (2011) 7 SCC 59 : (2011) 3 SCC (Cri) 23] . In Joseph Salvaraj A. [Joseph
Salvaraj A. v. State of Gujarat, (2011) 7 SCC 59 : (2011) 3 SCC (Cri) 23] , this Court
while deciding the question whether the High Court could entertain the Section 482
petition for quashing of FIR, when the charge-sheet was filed by the police during the
pendency of the Section 482 petition, observed : (SCC p. 63, para 16) “16. Thus, from
the general conspectus of the various sections under which the appellant is being
charged and is to be prosecuted would show that the same are not made out even
prima facie from the complainant's FIR. Even if the charge-sheet had been filed, the
learned Single Judge [Joesph Saivaraj A. v. State of Gujarat, 2007 SCC OnLine Guj
365] could have still examined whether the offences alleged to have been committed
by the appellant were prima facie made out from the complainant's FIR,
charge-sheet, documents, etc. or not.” xxx xxx xxx
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
41
16. There is nothing in the words of this section which restricts the exercise of the
power of the Court to prevent the abuse of process of court or miscarriage of justice
only to the stage of the FIR. It is settled principle of law that the High Court can
exercise jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC even when the discharge application is
pending with the trial court [G. Sagar Suri v. State of U.P., (2000) 2 SCC 636, para 7 :
2000 SCC (Cri) 513. Umesh Kumar v. State of A.P., (2013) 10 SCC 591, para 20 :
(2014) 1 SCC (Cri) 338 : (2014) 2 SCC (L&S) 237] . Indeed, it would be a travesty to
hold that proceedings initiated against a person can be interfered with at the stage of
FIR but not if it has advanced and the allegations have materialised into a
charge-sheet. On the contrary it could be said that the abuse of process caused by FIR
stands aggravated if the FIR has taken the form of a charge-sheet after investigation.
The power is undoubtedly conferred to prevent abuse of process of power of any
court.” (Emphasis supplied)
86. Similar view has been taken by this Court in Kailashben Mahendrabhai Patel v. State of
Maharashtra, reported in 2024 SCC OnLine SC 2621; A.M. Mohan v. State, reported in 2024 SCC
OnLine SC 339; Abhishek v. State of Madhya Pradesh, reported in (2023) 16 SCC 666 and Joseph
Salvaraj A. v. State of Gujarat, reported in (2011) 7 SCC 59 respectively.
87. It was held by this very Bench in Somjeet Mallick v. State of Jharkhand & Ors., reported in
(2024) 10 SCC 527, that a petition to quash the FIR does not become infructuous on submission of a
police report under Section 173(2) of the Cr.P.C. However, the courts are expected to apply their
mind to the materials submitted in support of the police report before deciding on whether the FIR
and consequential proceedings should be quashed or not. The relevant observations read thus:-
“19. No doubt, a petition to quash the FIR does not become infructuous on
submission of a police report under Section 173(2)CrPC, but when a police report has
been submitted, particularly when there is no stay on the investigation, the court
must apply its mind to the materials submitted in support of the police report before
taking a call whether the FIR and consequential proceedings should be quashed or
not. More so, when the FIR alleges an act which is reflective of a dishonest conduct of
the accused.
xxx xxx xxx
21. In our view, the High Court ought to have considered the materials collected
during investigation before taking a call on the prayer for quashing the FIR, the
cognizance order and the proceedings in pursuance thereof.” (Emphasis supplied)
88. We find it apt to mention that an accused person may approach the High Court for quashing of
the FIR and chargesheet under Article 226 of the Constitution till the time cognizance on the
chargesheet has not been taken by the jurisdictional Trial Court. Once cognizance is taken,
thereafter the accused person may approach the High Court under Section 528 of the B.N.S.S.
(earlier Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.) at any stage of the proceedings for quashing of the FIR and the
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025

42
consequential proceedings on the ground of abuse of the process of law. (See: Order dated
15.10.2024 in SLP (Crl.) 13578/2024, Neeta Singh and Others v. The State of Uttar Pradesh and
Others) iv. Whether criminal proceedings can be quashed by this Court in exercise of its powers
under Article 32?
89. We shall now proceed to address the question as to whether a writ petition invoking the
jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution would be maintainable for seeking
quashing of an FIR and the consequential proceedings arising therefrom.
90. This Court, as the highest constitutional court, has been conferred with the powers as enshrined
under Part III of the Constitution to provide remedies against the violation of fundamental rights.
The very fact that the right to constitutional remedies has itself been enshrined as a fundamental
right is a clear affirmation that this Court is the ultimate guarantor of their enforcement. Once the
Constitution has cast such a responsibility upon it, this Court need not direct a petitioner to pursue
an alternative remedy, when the grievance stems from the alleged violation of a fundamental right.
91. At the same time, although, as a matter of orderly procedure and judicial discipline, an aggrieved
party is expected, in the ordinary course, to first approach the High Court, yet where facts disclose a
palpable violation of the fundamental rights necessitating urgent intervention, it is incumbent upon
this Court, in exercise of its writ jurisdiction, to step in and secure justice. In such circumstances,
the existence of an alternative remedy cannot dilute the constitutional mandate entrusted to this
Court. That is why it is said that “Let justice be done, though the Heavens may fall”.
92. The protection of the rights of the accused under the Constitution stands on an equal footing
with the imperative of ensuring justice to the victim. In Amitbhai Anilchandra Shah v. Central
Bureau of Investigation & Anr., reported in (2013) 6 SCC 348, the petitioners sought quashing of the
FIR as it was violative of their fundamental rights under Articles 14, 20 and 21 of the Constitution
respectively. This Court upheld the maintainability of the writ petition and quashed the FIR while
holding that the filing of the said FIR was unwarranted and violative of the fundamental rights of
the petitioner-accused. The relevant observations read thus:-
“58.8. Likewise, in the case on hand, initially CBI took a stand that the third person
accompanying Sohrabuddin and Kausarbi was Kalimuddin. However, with the aid of
further investigation, it unveiled that the third person was Tulsiram Prajapati.
Therefore, only as a result of further investigation, CBI has gathered the information
that the third person was Tulsiram Prajapati. Thus a second FIR in the given facts
and circumstances is unwarranted : instead filing of a supplementary charge-sheet in
this regard will suffice the issue.
xxx
59. In the light of the specific stand taken by CBI before this Court in the earlier
proceedings by way of assertion in the form of counter-affidavit, status reports, etc.
we are of the view that filing of the second FIR and fresh charge- sheet is violative of
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
43
fundamental rights under Articles 14, 20 and 21 of the Constitution since the same
relate to alleged offence in respect of which an FIR had already been filed and the
court has taken cognizance. This Court categorically accepted CBI's plea that killing
of Tulsiram Prajapati is a part of the same series of cognizable offence forming part of
the first FIR and in spite of the fact that this Court directed CBI to “take over” the
investigation and did not grant the relief as prayed, namely, registration of fresh FIR,
the present action of CBI filing fresh FIR is contrary to various judicial
pronouncements which is demonstrated in the earlier part of our judgment.”
(Emphasis supplied)
93. In Arnab Ranjan Goswami (supra), the petitioner therein had filed a writ petition under Article
32 of the Constitution for quashing of an FIR. This Court observed that a prima facie evaluation of
the FIR failed to disclose any offence. The Court declined to entertain the prayers for quashing of
FIR and the alternate relief sought for transfer of probe to CBI only as a matter of entertainability
and not a matter of maintainability. In other words, in the facts of that case, the Court did not find
any exceptional grounds to bypass the power of the High Court under Section 482 of the CrPC. The
Court also actively remarked that the non-entertainability of the prayers of the petitioner therein
must not be misconstrued as holding that the petition under Article 32 is not maintainable. We have
extracted the relevant paragraph below:-
“57. We hold that it would be inappropriate for the Court to exercise its jurisdiction
under Article 32 of the Constitution for the purpose of quashing FIR No. 164 of 2020
under investigation at N.M. Joshi Marg Police Station in Mumbai. In adopting this
view, we are guided by the fact that the checks and balances to ensure the protection
of the petitioner's liberty are governed by the CrPC. Despite the liberty being granted
to the petitioner on 24-4-2020 [Arnab Ranjan Goswami v. Union of India, (2020) 14
SCC 51] , it is an admitted position that the petitioner did not pursue available
remedies in the law, but sought instead to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court.
Whether the allegations contained in the FIR do or do not make out any offence as alleged will not
be decided in pursuance of the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32, to quash the FIR. The
petitioner must be relegated to the pursuit of the remedies available under the CrPC, which we
hereby do. The petitioner has an equally efficacious remedy available before the High Court. We
should not be construed as holding that a petition under Article 32 is not maintainable. But when
the High Court has the power under Section 482, there is no reason to by-pass the procedure under
the CrPC, we see no exceptional grounds or reasons to entertain this petition under Article 32. There
is a clear distinction between the maintainability of a petition and whether it should be entertained.
In a situation like this, and for the reasons stated hereinabove, this Court would not like to entertain
the petition under Article 32 for the relief of quashing the FIR being investigated at N.M. Joshi
Police Station in Mumbai which can be considered by the High Court. Therefore, we are of the
opinion that the petitioner must be relegated to avail of the remedies which are available under the
CrPC before the competent court including the High Court.” (Emphasis supplied)

94. In the recent past, a Coordinate Bench of this Court in Vinod Dua v. Union of India, reported in
(2023) 14 SCC 286, had quashed an FIR lodged against the petitioner therein in exercise of its
powers under the writ jurisdiction. The petitioner therein had prayed for quashing of the FIR on the
grounds that the criminal proceedings so initiated were an abuse of the process of the court and
violative of his fundamental rights. This Court noted that the practice to direct the petitioners to
approach the respective High Courts before approaching this Court is a practice of self-discipline,
considering the pressure of mounting cases, however, in glaring circumstances showing blatant
violation of fundamental rights, this Court would not hesitate to consider a writ petition filed for
quashing of the criminal proceedings. In other words, there is no bar for this Court if it intends and
finds fit to exercise its jurisdiction under Article 32 of the Constitution for the purpose of quashing
of criminal proceedings. It also applied the principles of Bhajan Lal (supra), in order to test if the
criminal proceedings deserved to be quashed. It further relied upon a three- Judge Bench decision
in Priya Prakash Varrier v. State of Telangana, reported in (2019) 12 SCC 432, in which this Court
had quashed the criminal proceedings against the petitioner in exercise of its powers under Article
32 jurisdiction, on reaching the conclusion that the elements of Section 295A of the IPC were
entirely absent. The relevant paragraphs have been produced below:
“27. In Priya Prakash Varrier [Priya Prakash Varrier v. State of Telangana, (2019) 12
SCC 432 : (2019) 4 SCC (Cri) 397] , the nature of relief claimed was set out in para 1
of the decision whereafter this Court relied upon the dictum of the Constitution
Bench in Ramji Lal Modi v. State of U.P. [Ramji Lal Modi v. State of U.P., 1957 SCC
OnLine SC 77 : AIR 1957 SC 620] that for an offence to come within the parameters
of Section 295-AIPC, the crime ought to have been committed with deliberate and
malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of a class. Finding such
element to be completely absent, the relief prayed for was granted by this Court. The
relevant observations of this Court were : (Priya Prakash Varrier case [Priya Prakash
Varrier v. State of Telangana, (2019) 12 SCC 432 : (2019) 4 SCC (Cri) 397] , SCC pp.
433-37, paras 1, 7, 12-13 and 15) “1. In the instant writ petition preferred under
Article 32 of the Constitution of India, the petitioners, namely, the actor, producer
and director of the movie, have prayed for quashing of FIR No. 34 of 2018, dated 14-
2-2018, registered at Falaknama Police Station, Hyderabad, Telangana. That apart, a prayer has also
been made that no FIR should be entertained or no complaint under Section 200 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 should be dealt with because of the picturisation of the song “Manikya
Malaraya Poovi” by Petitioner 1 in the film, namely, “Oru Adaar Love”.
xxx Notably, this decision rendered by a three-Judge Bench of this Court was in the context of right
claimed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, where the offence alleged was one under Section
295-AIPC. Apart from quashing the FIR, this Court also directed that no FIR or complaint should be
entertained against the petitioners because of the picturisation of the song concerned.

30. In Jagisha Arora v. State of U.P. [Jagisha Arora v. State of U.P., (2019) 6 SCC 619 : (2019) 2 SCC

remand passed by the jurisdictional Magistrate despite the objection that the order must be
challenged in accordance with the provisions of the Code. The discussion was : (SCC pp. 619- 20,

Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India are non-negotiable.

allegation on various technical grounds including the ground that there is an order of remand
passed by the jurisdictional Magistrate. It is also contended that the High Court should have first
been approached.

Additional Solicitor General argued that the question of whether a writ of habeas corpus could be
maintained in respect of a person who was in police custody pursuant to a remand order passed by
the jurisdictional Magistrate in connection with the offence under investigation, had already been
settled by this Court. This application, is, therefore not maintainable. It was argued that the order of
remand ought to be challenged in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code. It
was also argued that this Court does not ordinarily entertain writ petitions unless the High Court
has first been approached.
5. As a matter of self-imposed discipline and considering the pressure of mounting cases on this
Court, it has become the practice of this Court to ordinarily direct that the High Court first be
approached even in cases of violation of fundamental rights. However, Article 32 which is itself a
fundamental right cannot be rendered nugatory in a glaring case of deprivation of liberty as in the
instant case, where the jurisdictional Magistrate has passed an order of remand till 22-6-2019 which
means that the petitioner's husband Prashant Kanojia would be in custody for about 13/14 days for
putting up posts/tweets on the social media.
6. We are not inclined to sit back on technical grounds. In exercise of power under Article 142 of the
Constitution of India this Court can mould the reliefs to do complete justice.
7. We direct that the petitioner's husband be immediately released on bail on conditions to the
satisfaction of the jurisdictional Chief Judicial Magistrate. It is made clear that this order is not to be
construed as an approval of the posts/tweets in the social media. This order is passed in view of the
excessiveness of the action taken.”
31. Thus, the practice of directing that the High Court be approached first even in cases of violation
of fundamental rights, is more of a self-imposed discipline by this Court; but in glaring cases of
deprivation of liberty, this Court has entertained petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution. We
may, at this stage, also notice the following observations made in Union of India v. Paul Manickam
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
46
[Union of India v. Paul Manickam, (2003) 8 SCC 342 :
2004 SCC (Cri) 239] : (SCC p. 356, para 22) “22. Another aspect which has been
highlighted is that many unscrupulous petitioners are approaching this Court under
Article 32 of the Constitution challenging the order of detention directly without first
approaching the High Courts concerned. It is appropriate that the High Court
concerned under whose jurisdiction the order of detention has been passed by the
State Government or Union Territory should be approached first. In order to invoke
the jurisdiction under Article 32 of the Constitution to approach this Court directly, it
has to be shown by the petitioner as to why the High Court has not been approached,
could not be approached or it is futile to approach the High Court. Unless satisfactory
reasons are indicated in this regard, filing of petition in such matters directly under
Article 32 of the Constitution is to be discouraged.”” (Emphasis supplied) v. Whether
multiple FIRs pertaining to the same alleged offence are maintainable?
95. The earliest information, being the first in point of time, relating to the
commission of a cognizable offence and recorded by the officer in charge of a police
station, is what sets the investigative machinery in motion and marks the
commencement of investigation. This information is commonly referred to as “the
FIR”, and it is the only FIR. It is, no doubt, possible that more than one piece of
information may be furnished to the police concerning the same incident involving
one or multiple cognizable offences.
96. A plain reading of Section 154 of the Cr.P.C. makes it clear that a police officer is
not obliged to record every subsequent piece of information in the station diary as the
first information. The expression “second FIR” is a misnomer, for the law does not
recognize the registration of more than one First Information Report in respect of the
same offence. Any action taken by the police on information received after the first
report forms part of the investigation into the same offence. The investigating agency,
in the discharge of its bounden duty, must inquire not only into the cognizable
offence disclosed in the first report but also into all connected offences arising from
the same transaction or occurrence.
97. The existence of another FIR stamps an abuse of investigative powers,
undermines the fairness of the investigative process, and exposes the accused to
unwarranted harassment through repeated investigations into the same offence. Such
a practice militates against the procedure that all connected offences arising from the
same incident or transaction must be investigated together in a single proceeding. It
is for this reason that the law disregards the practice of registering a “second FIR”,
save in situations where the test of sameness is inapplicable or a counter-case is being
investigated into. In such cases, the High Court, in exercise of its inherent powers
under Section 482 Cr.P.C. and/or its extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of
the Constitution, may quash the subsequent FIR to prevent abuse of the process of
law.

47
98. This Court in T.T. Antony (supra), categorically held that any information
furnished to the officer in charge of a police station after the commencement of
investigation would constitute a statement covered by Section 162 of the Cr.P.C. No
such information, subsequent to the first information, can be treated as an FIR under
Section 154 of the Cr.P.C., for that would amount to a “second FIR,” which is
impermissible in law. The scheme of the Cr.P.C.
only recognizes the first information about a cognizable offence as satisfying the requirements of
Section 154 of the Cr.P.C. It was held therein that there can be no fresh investigation on receipt of
subsequent information qua the same cognizable offence/same occurrence/incident. The Court,
without a scintilla of doubt, was correct in holding that a case arising out of second FIR is a fit case
for exercise of power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. and/or Article 226 of the Constitution. The
relevant paragraphs are as follows:
“18.[…] All other informations made orally or in writing after the commencement of
the investigation into the cognizable offence disclosed from the facts mentioned in
the first information report and entered in the station house diary by the police
officer or such other cognizable offences as may come to his notice during the
investigation, will be statements falling under Section 162 CrPC. No such
information/statement can properly be treated as an FIR and entered in the station
house diary again, as it would in effect be a second FIR and the same cannot be in
conformity with the scheme of CrPC. Take a case where an FIR mentions cognizable
offence under Section 307 or 326 IPC and the investigating agency learns during the
investigation or receives fresh information that the victim died, no fresh FIR under
Section 302 IPC need be registered which will be irregular; in such a case alteration
of the provision of law in the first FIR is the proper course to adopt. Let us consider a
different situation in which H having killed W, his wife, informs the police that she is
killed by an unknown person or knowing that W is killed by his mother or sister, H
owns up the responsibility and during investigation the truth is detected; it does not
require filing of fresh FIR against H — the real offender — who can be arraigned in
the report under Section 173(2) or 173(8) CrPC, as the case may be. It is of course
permissible for the investigating officer to send up a report to the Magistrate
concerned even earlier that investigation is being directed against the person
suspected to be the accused.
xxx
20. From the above discussion it follows that under the scheme of the provisions of
Sections 154, 155, 156, 157, 162, 169, 170 and 173 CrPC only the earliest or the first
information in regard to the commission of a cognizable offence satisfies the
requirements of Section 154 CrPC.
Thus there can be no second FIR and consequently there can be no fresh investigation on receipt of
every subsequent information in respect of the same cognizable offence or the same occurrence or
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
48
incident giving rise to one or more cognizable offences. On receipt of information about a cognizable
offence or an incident giving rise to a cognizable offence or offences and on entering the FIR in the
station house diary, the officer in charge of a police station has to investigate not merely the
cognizable offence reported in the FIR but also other connected offences found to have been
committed in the course of the same transaction or the same occurrence and file one or more
reports as provided in Section 173 CrPC.
xxx
27. A just balance between the fundamental rights of the citizens under Articles 19 and 21 of the
Constitution and the expansive power of the police to investigate a cognizable offence has to be
struck by the court. There cannot be any controversy that sub-section (8) of Section 173 CrPC
empowers the police to make further investigation, obtain further evidence (both oral and
documentary) and forward a further report or reports to the Magistrate. In Narang case [(1979) 2
SCC 322 : 1979 SCC (Cri) 479] it was, however, observed that it would be appropriate to conduct
further investigation with the permission of the court. However, the sweeping power of investigation
does not warrant subjecting a citizen each time to fresh investigation by the police in respect of the
same incident, giving rise to one or more cognizable offences, consequent upon filing of successive
FIRs whether before or after filing the final report under Section 173(2) CrPC. It would clearly be
beyond the purview of Sections 154 and 156 CrPC, nay, a case of abuse of the statutory power of
investigation in a given case. In our view a case of fresh investigation based on the second or
successive FIRs, not being a counter-case, filed in connection with the same or connected cognizable
offence alleged to have been committed in the course of the same transaction and in respect of
which pursuant to the first FIR either investigation is under way or final report under Section 173(2)
has been forwarded to the Magistrate, may be a fit case for exercise of power under Section 482
CrPC or under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution.” (Emphasis supplied)
99. In Babubhai (supra), this Court laid down the “test of sameness” to determine whether a second
FIR pertains to the very same incident or constitutes different parts of the same transaction. It held
that if the answer is in the affirmative, the second FIR ought to be quashed. However, where the
subsequent information discloses a distinct offence or version or sets up a counterclaim, the
investigating agency is not precluded from proceeding thereon. The relevant observations read
thus:-
“20. Thus, in view of the above, the law on the subject emerges to the effect that an
FIR under Section 154 CrPC is a very important document. It is the first information
of a cognizable offence recorded by the officer in charge of the police station. It sets
the machinery of criminal law in motion and marks the commencement of the
investigation which ends with the formation of an opinion under Section 169 or 170
CrPC, as the case may be, and forwarding of a police report under Section 173 CrPC.
Thus, it is quite possible that more than one piece of information be given to the
police officer in charge of the police station in respect of the same incident involving
one or more than one cognizable offences. In such a case, he need not enter each
piece of information in the diary. All other information given orally or in writing after
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
49
the commencement of the investigation into the facts mentioned in the first
information report will be statements falling under Section 162 CrPC.
21. In such a case the court has to examine the facts and circumstances giving rise to
both the FIRs and the test of sameness is to be applied to find out whether both the
FIRs relate to the same incident in respect of the same occurrence or are in regard to
the incidents which are two or more parts of the same transaction. If the answer is in
the affirmative, the second FIR is liable to be quashed.
However, in case, the contrary is proved, where the version in the second FIR is different and they
are in respect of the two different incidents/crimes, the second FIR is permissible. In case in respect
of the same incident the accused in the first FIR comes forward with a different version or
counterclaim, investigation on both the FIRs has to be conducted.” (Emphasis supplied)
100. This Court again reiterated that there cannot be more than one FIR for the same offence in
Anju Chaudhary v. State of U.P., reported in (2013) 6 SCC
384. It permitted registration of an FIR when the incident is found to be separate; offences are
similar or different, or where the subsequent crime is of such magnitude that it does not fall within
the scope of the FIR recorded first. The Court held that the right to investigate flows from the
Cr.P.C., and the power of reinvestigation or de novo investigation is beyond the competence of the
investigating agency. The “test of sameness” introduced in Babubhai (supra) was affirmed to
ascertain whether both the FIRs relate to the same incident and same occurrence. The relevant
observation reads thus:-
“14. On the plain construction of the language and scheme of Sections 154, 156 and
190 of the Code, it cannot be construed or suggested that there can be more than one
FIR about an occurrence. However, the opening words of Section 154 suggest that
every information relating to commission of a cognizable offence shall be reduced
into writing by the officer-in-charge of a police station. This implies that there has to
be the first information report about an incident which constitutes a cognizable
offence. The purpose of registering an FIR is to set the machinery of criminal
investigation into motion, which culminates with filing of the police report in terms
of Section 173(2) of the Code. It will, thus, be appropriate to follow the settled
principle that there cannot be two FIRs registered for the same offence. However,
where the incident is separate; offences are similar or different, or even where the
subsequent crime is of such magnitude that it does not fall within the ambit and
scope of the FIR recorded first, then a second FIR could be registered. The most
important aspect is to examine the inbuilt safeguards provided by the legislature in
the very language of Section 154 of the Code. These safeguards can be safely deduced
from the principle akin to double jeopardy, rule of fair investigation and further to
prevent abuse of power by the investigating authority of the police. Therefore, second
FIR for the same incident cannot be registered. […] More so, in the backdrop of the
settled canons of criminal jurisprudence, reinvestigation or de novo investigation is
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
50
beyond the competence of not only the investigating agency but even that of the
learned Magistrate. The courts have taken this view primarily for the reason that it
would be opposed to the scheme of the Code and more particularly Section 167(2) of
the Code. (Ref. Reeta Nag v. State of W.B. [(2009) 9 SCC 129 : (2009) 3 SCC (Cri)
1051] and Vinay Tyagi v.
Irshad Ali [(2013) 5 SCC 762] of the same date.)” xxx
25. The first information report is a very important document, besides that it sets the machinery of
criminal law in motion. It is a very material document on which the entire case of the prosecution is
built. Upon registration of FIR, beginning of investigation in a case, collection of evidence during
investigation and formation of the final opinion is the sequence which results in filing of a report
under Section 173 of the Code. The possibility that more than one piece of information is given to
the police officer- in-charge of a police station, in respect of the same incident involving one or more
than one cognizable offences, cannot be ruled out. Other materials and information given to or
received otherwise by the investigating officer would be statements covered under Section 162 of the
Code. The court in order to examine the impact of one or more FIRs has to rationalise the facts and
circumstances of each case and then apply the test of “sameness” to find out whether both FIRs
relate to the same incident and to the same occurrence, are in regard to incidents which are two or
more parts of the same transaction or relate completely to two distinct occurrences. If the answer
falls in the first category, the second FIR may be liable to be quashed. However, in case the contrary
is proved, whether the version of the second FIR is different and they are in respect of two different
incidents/crimes, the second FIR is permissible, this is the view expressed by this Court in Babubhai
v. State of Gujarat [(2010) 12 SCC 254 : (2011) 1 SCC (Cri) 336] . This judgment clearly spells out the
distinction between two FIRs relating to the same incident and two FIRs relating to different
incidents or occurrences of the same incident, etc.” (Emphasis supplied)
101. This Court in Arnab Ranjan Goswami (supra), again, had the occasion to hold that any
information relating to the same cognizable offence, the same occurrence, or the incident giving rise
to one or more cognizable offences, cannot be treated as a fresh first information report and is
barred. Except in cases where the test of sameness is inapplicable or where a counter-case arises,
registration of a subsequent FIR would amount to an abuse of the investigative process and would
warrant the exercise of inherent powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. and/or the extraordinary
jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. The relevant observations read thus:-
“31. The Court held that “there can be no second FIR” where the information
concerns the same cognizable offence alleged in the first FIR or the same occurrence
or incident which gives rise to one or more cognizable offences. This is due to the fact
that the investigation covers within its ambit not just the alleged cognizable offence,
but also any other connected offences that may be found to have been committed.
This Court held that once an FIR postulated by the provisions of Section 154 has been
recorded, any information received after the commencement of investigation cannot
form the basis of a second FIR as doing so would fail to comport with the scheme of
the CrPC. The Court observed : (T.T. Antony case [T.T. Antony v. State of Kerala,
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
51
(2001) 6 SCC 181 :
2001 SCC (Cri) 1048] , SCC p. 196, para 18) “18. … All other information made orally
or in writing after the commencement of the investigation into the cognizable offence
disclosed from the facts mentioned in the first information report and entered in the
station house diary by the police officer or such other cognizable offences as may
come to his notice during the investigation, will be statements falling under Section
162 CrPC. No such information/statement can properly be treated as an FIR and
entered in the station house diary again, as it would in effect be a second FIR and the
same cannot be in conformity with the scheme of CrPC.” xxx
33. The Court held that barring situations in which a counter-case is filed, a fresh
investigation or a second FIR on the basis of the same or connected cognizable
offence would constitute an “abuse of the statutory power of investigation” and may
be a fit case for the exercise of power either under Section 482 CrPC or Articles
226/227 of the Constitution.” (Emphasis supplied)
102. Recently, in State of Rajasthan v. Surendra Singh Rathore, reported in 2025 SCC OnLine SC
358, Sanjay Karol, J., upon referring to the earlier decisions of this Court, laid down the principles
regarding the permissibility of the registration of a second FIR. The relevant paragraphs have been
reproduced hereinbelow:-
“9. From the above conspectus of judgments, inter alia, the following principles
emerge regarding the permissibility of the registration of a second FIR:
9.1 When the second FIR is counter-complaint or presents a rival version of a set of
facts, in reference to which an earlier FIR already stands registered.
9.2 When the ambit of the two FIRs is different even though they may arise from the
same set of circumstances. 9.3 When investigation and/or other avenues reveal the
earlier FIR or set of facts to be part of a larger conspiracy.
9.4 When investigation and/or persons related to the incident bring to the light
hitherto unknown facts or circumstances.
9.5 Where the incident is separate; offences are similar or different.” (Emphasis
supplied) vi. Whether the FIR No. 224/2022, having been lodged at the instance of a
complainant other than a person prescribed under the unamended Section 4 of the
U.P. Conversion Act, is liable to be quashed on that ground alone?
103. One of the primary contentions of the petitioners seeking to challenge FIR No. 224/2022 was
that Section 4 of the U.P. Conversion Act mandates that only an ‘aggrieved person’ or their relative
by blood, marriage or adoption, can lodge an FIR with respect to the acts of unlawful conversion.
However, the complainant in FIR No. 224/2022 being a person who does not qualify as a person
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
52
eligible to lodge an FIR under Section 4, the FIR suffers from an incurable defect and is liable to be
quashed on this ground alone.
104. While vehemently opposing the aforesaid contention canvassed on behalf of the
appellant(s)/petitioners, the learned AG submitted that the general principle of criminal law is that
investigation into an offence can be triggered by any information emanating from any source and
thus notwithstanding the unamended Section 4 of the U.P. Conversion Act, the investigation
relating to the offences under the U.P. Conversion Act and connected offences under the IPC can be
undertaken with or without complaints made under Section 4 of the U.P. Conversion Act. The object
of the unamended Section 4 was only to recognise the special locus of certain classes of people to
complain of the offences defined under the UP Conversion Act, and it was not in any way meant to
restrict the ambit of the provision to only the specified classes of persons. He emphasised that
illegality is by reason of the breach of the law and it will be so independent of who informs and will
always be so.
105. For the purpose of addressing the aforesaid contention of the appellant(s)/petitioner(s), it is
important for us to refer to Section 4 of the U.P. Conversion Act. Section 4, as it stood prior to its
amendment in 2024, is reproduced hereinbelow:
“4. Person competent to lodge First Information Report.—Any aggrieved person,
his/her parents, brother, sister, or any other person who is related to him/her by
blood, marriage or adoption may lodge a First Information Report of such conversion
which contravenes the provisions of Section 3.”
106. Section 4 came to be amended by the 2024 Amendment, and now stands thus:
“4. Person competent to lodge First Information Report.—An information relating to
the contravention of the provisions of the Act may be given by any person and the
manner of giving such information shall be the same as given in Chapter XIII of the
Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (Act 46 of 2023).”
107. The relevant extracts from the Statement of Objects and Reasons attached to the 2024
Amendment pertaining to the object behind the amendment of Section 4 are reproduced
hereinbelow:
“[...] as it has also become necessary to resolve certain difficulties that have arisen in
the past in various cases regarding the interpretation of section 4 of the Act, it has
been decided to amend the aforesaid Act.”
108. A perusal of the Amendment Act, 2024 makes it amply clear that it is the unamended Section 4
of the U.P. Conversion Act which is applicable to FIRs sought to be quashed in the batch of matters
under consideration, all of them having been lodged prior in time to the said Amendment. Thus, the
pivotal question that falls for our determination is whether FIR No. 224/2022 could be said to have
been lodged by a person as contemplated under Section 4 of the U.P. Conversion Act. The natural
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
53
corollary to the same is whether an FIR could have been lodged on the basis of a complaint made by
a person who does not fall within one of the categories specified in Section 4.
109. The unamended Section 4 of the U.P. Conversion Act stipulated that any aggrieved person,
his/her parents, brother, sister, or any other person who is related to him/her by blood, marriage or
adoption can get an FIR registered for forceful religious conversion which contravenes the
provisions of Section
3. A plain reading of the provision indicates that the intention of the legislature in prescribing a list
of persons competent to lodge an FIR for contravention of the Act was to restrict the manner in
which the prosecution under the U.P. Conversion Act could be initiated, the reason for the same
being that the religious belief being an inherently personal and private aspect of an individual’s
identity, it is only such a person or persons closely associated to him, who would be competent to
report any incident of forceful, fraudulent, deceitful or otherwise illegal conversion which is in
contravention of Section
3.
110. The restricted nature of the unamended Section 4 of the U.P. Conversion Act was taken note of
by the High Court in one of the impugned judgments dated 17.02.2023 passed in the Criminal Misc.
Writ Petition No. 1814 of 2023 wherein it was observed thus:
“The various categories of person enumerated in Section 4, who are competent to
lodge the first information report are any aggrieved person. The words "any
aggrieved person" at the very start of the said section can be interpreted to mean any
person, especially since there is no provision under the I.P.C. or Cr.P.C., which bars
or prohibits any person from lodging a first information report regarding cognizable
offence. However, the words " any aggrieved person" in our considered opinion is
qualified by the subsequent categories and the words his, her parents, brother, sisters
or blood relations by marriage and adoption included. Therefore, the words "any
aggrieved person", if taken by themselves are extremely wide. The scope of the said
term is completely whittled down by subsequent categories and therefore, it has to be
said that any aggrieved person would be a person but is personally aggrieved by his or
her fraudulent conversion be it an individual or in a mass conversion ceremony. Any
interpretation to the contrary would render the remainder of Section 4 after the
words "any aggrieved person " wholly redundant and also render the Section itself
completely meaningless. Under the said circumstances, we are constrained to rule
that the first information report dated 15.04.2022 was not lodged by a competent
person. […]” (Emphasis supplied)
111. The High Court, in one another decision in Jose Papachen (supra), also observed
that the unamended Section 4 of the U.P. Conversion Act restricts the categories of
persons who are competent to lodge an FIR for violation of Section 3. The relevant
observations read thus:
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
54
“16. It also requires to be noted that the instant first information was not lodged by
the competent person as required under Section 4 of the Act of 2021. The various
categories of person enumerated in Section 4, who are competent to lodge the first
information report are any aggrieved person. The words “any aggrieved person” at
the very start of the said section can be interpreted to mean any person, especially
since there is no provision under the I.P.C. or Cr. P.C., which bars or prohibits any
person from lodging a first information report regarding cognizable offence.
However, the words “any aggrieved person” is qualified by the subsequent categories
and the words his, her parents, brother, sisters or blood relations by marriage and
adoption included. Therefore, the words “any aggrieved person”, if taken by
themselves are extremely wide. The scope of the said term is completely whittled
down by subsequent categories and therefore, it has to be said that any aggrieved
person would be a person but is personally aggrieved by his or her fraudulent
conversion be it an individual or in a mass conversion ceremony. Any interpretation
to the contrary would render the remainder of Section 4 after the words “any
aggrieved person” wholly redundant and also render the Section itself completely
meaningless. Under the said circumstances the first information report dated
24-01-2023 was not lodged by a competent person.” (Emphasis supplied)
112. Undoubtedly, the U.P. Conversion Act is a piece of special legislation which
introduces a somewhat different regime than the one prescribed under the Cr.P.C.
Sub-section (1) of Section 7 stipulates that notwithstanding anything contained in the
B.N.S.S., all offences under the U.P. Conversion Act shall be cognizable, non-bailable
and exclusively triable by the Court of Session.
Further, Sub-section (2) of Section 7 provides that no person accused of an offence under the U.P.
Conversion Act shall be released on bail unless the Public Prosecutor has been given an opportunity
of opposing the bail application. These instances of departure from the usual criminal procedure
indicate that the U.P. Conversion Act is a piece of special legislation enacted keeping in mind a
special category of offences.
113. It is not uncommon for the legislature to enact legislations departing from the usual criminal
procedure, keeping in mind the special needs which the legislation has been enacted to cater to. The
scope of Section 32 of one such legislation, namely the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, was at the
heart of the controversy in the decision of this Court in Union of India v. Ashok Kumar Sharma
reported in (2021) 12 SCC 674. Section 32 of the said Act prescribes four categories of persons who
are competent to institute prosecution for the offences committed under the said Act. The provision
reads thus:
“32. Cognizance of offences— (1) No prosecution under this Chapter shall be
instituted except by— (a) an Inspector; or (b) any gazetted officer of the Central
Government or a State Government authorised in writing in this behalf by the Central
Government or a State Government or by a general or special order made in this
behalf by that Government; or (c) the person aggrieved; or (d) a recognised consumer
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025

55
association whether such person is a member of that association or not.
(2) Save as otherwise provided in this Act, no court inferior to that of a Court of
Session shall try an offence punishable under this Chapter.
(3) Nothing contained in this Chapter shall be deemed to prevent any person from
being prosecuted under any other law for any act or omission which constitutes an
offence against this Chapter.”
114. The question which arose for the consideration of this Court was whether a Police Officer, not
being specified as one of the persons who can initiate prosecution under Section 32, can file a report
under Section 173 of the Cr.P.C. and whether the court can take cognizance of the offence based on
such report. Answering the question in the negative, the Court held that being a special enactment,
the procedure prescribed in the enactment has to be followed, and not otherwise. The relevant
observations read thus:
“46. The Scheme of the Act must be borne in mind when Section 32, which provides,
inter alia, that an Inspector can set the ball rolling, is considered. The Inspectors,
under the Act, are to possess the prescribed qualifications. The qualifications bear a
nexus with the performance of the specialised duties which are to be performed
under the Act. Apparently, knowledge about the drugs and cosmetics goes a long way
in equipping them to perform their multifarious functions. Section 22 clothing the
Inspector with powers must also be viewed thus in the context of the legislative value
judgment that a complaint is to be moved by the Inspector under the Act and not by a
police officer under CrPC. The Inspector is expected to inspect premises where drugs
and cosmetics are being manufactured, sold, stocked, exhibited, offered for sale or
distributed. Samples are to be taken at the points of manufacturing, selling, stocking
and the points of delivery. He is expected also, where he has reason to believe that an
offence under the Act has been committed, to search any person, enter any place,
stop and search any vehicle, examine records, and documents and seize the same.
Last but not the least, Section 22(1)(d) declares that he may exercise other powers as
may be necessary for carrying out the purposes of Chapter IV or any Rules made
thereunder. The elaborate procedure to be followed by the Inspectors is also provided
by the law.

49. Section 32 of the Act undoubtedly provides for taking cognizance of the offence
by the court only at the instance of the four categories mentioned therein. They are:
(a) Inspector under the Act;
(b) Any Gazetted Officer empowered by the Central or the State Government;

56
(c) Aggrieved person; and
(d) Voluntary Association.
It is clear that the legislature has not included the police officer as a person who can move the court.
Before the matter reaches the court, under Section 190 CrPC, ordinarily starting with the lodging of
the first information report leading to the registration of the first information report, investigation is
carried out culminating in a report under Section 173. The police report, in fact, is the report
submitted under Section 173 CrPC to the court. Under Section 190 CrPC, the court may take
cognizance on the basis of the police report. Such a procedure is alien to Section 32 of the Act. In
other words, it is not open to the police officer to submit a report under Section 173 CrPC in regard
to an offence under Chapter IV of the Act under Section 32. In regard to offences contemplated
under Section 32(3), the police officer may have power as per the provisions concerned. Being a
special enactment, the manner of dealing with the offences under the Act, would be governed by the
provisions of the Act. It is to be noted that Section 32 declares that no court inferior to the Court of
Session shall try offence punishable under Chapter IV. We have noticed that under Section 193
CrPC, no Court of Session can take cognizance of any offence as a court of original jurisdiction
unless the case has been committed to it by a Magistrate under CrPC. This is, undoubtedly, subject
to the law providing expressly that that Court of Session may take cognizance of any offence as the
court of original jurisdiction. There is no provision in the Act which expressly authorises the Special
Court which is the Court of Session to take cognizance of the offence under Chapter IV. This means
that the provisions of Chapters XV and XVI CrPC must be followed in regard to even offences falling
under Chapter IV of the Act. Starting with Section 200 of the Act dealing with taking of cognizance
by a Magistrate on a complaint, including examination of the witnesses produced by the
complainant, the dismissal of an unworthy complaint under Section 203 and following the
procedure under Section 202 in the case of postponement of issue of process are all steps to be
followed. It is true that when the complaint under Section 32 is filed either by the Inspector or by
the authorised Gazetted Officer being public servants under Section 200, the Magistrate is exempted
from examining the complainant and witnesses.” (Emphasis supplied)
115. The Court also addressed the contention that as Section 154 of the Cr.P.C.
mandates a police officer to register an FIR wherever any information about the commission of a
cognizable offence is received, it would not be open to the police officer to refuse to register an FIR,
and such a reading of Section 32 of the said Act would run contrary to the decision of this Court in
Lalita Kumari v. State of U.P., reported in (2014) 2 SCC 1. The Court rejected such contention and
observed as follows:
“80. In the said case, a Constitution Bench of this Court has held that registration of
an FIR is mandatory under Section 154CrPC, if the information discloses commission
of a cognizable offence and no preliminary inquiry is permissible in such a situation.
It was further held that a preliminary inquiry may be conducted only to ascertain
whether a cognizable offence is disclosed or not, if the information received does not
disclose a cognizable offence but indicates the need for such an inquiry. The Court
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
57
has also indicated certain cases where a preliminary inquiry may be conducted,
depending on the facts and circumstances of each case. They include matrimonial
disputes, commercial offences and cases where there is abnormal delay/laches. This
Court also held that the aforesaid were not exhaustive of all conditions which may
warrant a preliminary inquiry.
81. We would think that this Court was not, in the said case, considering a case under
the Act or cases similar to those under the Act, and we would think that having regard
to the discussion which we have made and on a conspectus of the provisions of CrPC
and Section 32 of the Act, the principle laid down in Lalita Kumari [Lalita Kumari v.
State of U.P., (2014) 2 SCC 1 : (2014) 1 SCC (Cri) 524] is not attracted when an
information is made before a police officer making out the commission of an offence
under Chapter IV of the Act mandating a registration of an FIR under Section 154
CrPC.
xxx xxx xxx
85. It is to be noted that the duty to register FIR, when information is received about a cognizable
offence falling under Chapter IV of the Act, it is clear from the very inception that a police officer has
no jurisdiction to investigate the offence. It is not a case of absence of territorial jurisdiction. No
doubt, if it is a case of another police officer being empowered to investigate the offence in terms of
powers under CrPC, the law is, as laid down, that there is the obligation to register an FIR and then
make it over to the police station which has jurisdiction. In fact, a conflict, when in the context of
Sections 178 to 185CrPC, which constitute exceptions to the general principle laid down in Section
177CrPC, the High Court is to decide the dispute, as is provided in Section 186CrPC. If an
information is relatable only to cognizable offences under Chapter IV of the Act, we would think that
the police officer would be out of bounds and he has no role to play in the investigation as neither he
nor any other police officer has any role to play in the investigation. His duty lies in referring the
complainant to the Drugs Inspector concerned. If he is in receipt of information about an offence
under Chapter IV of the Act, he must promptly notify the Drugs Inspector concerned.” (Emphasis
supplied)
116. We are inclined to adopt the reasoning as assigned in Ashok Kumar Sharma (supra) as
discussed above for the simple reason that the U.P. Conversion Act, being a special legislation, has
prescribed certain special procedural norms as distinguished from the Cr.P.C. It is a settled position
of law that the intention of the legislature should be construed from the plain text of the statute, and
if the plain interpretation does not result into any absurdity or is not unworkable, then the courts
should not depart from the meaning which is manifest from the plain text. It is only in cases where
the text does not speak for itself, or more than one interpretation is possible, that the courts should
resort to tools of statutory interpretation. In the case in hand, the words employed by the legislature
in the unamended Section 4 of the U.P. Conversion Act are abundantly indicative of the intent of the
legislature to only allow a certain specified category of persons to make a complaint for the violation
of Section 3 of the said Act. Thus, we find no good reason to take the view that despite being a
special legislation, Section 154 of the Cr.P.C. should be given primacy over Section 4 of the U.P.
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
58
Conversion Act. We are also not inclined to accept the submission of the learned AG that Section 4 is
a mere declaration and not a contradiction from the general scheme of Section 154 of the Cr.P.C. for
the simple reason that when the legislature has enacted special and more stringent provisions as
regards other aspects covered by the said legislation, then a clause restricting the scope of initiation
of prosecution under the same enactment cannot be casually construed as a mere surplusage. The
specific declaration in Section 4 cannot be understood as a mere procedural nicety but has to be
given its intended meaning to ensure that it fits in with the overall scheme of prosecution provided
under the said legislation.
117. It is manifest from a plain reading of the statutory scheme of the unamended Section 4 that the
initiation of prosecution for the alleged offence of illegal religious conversion stands circumscribed
and may be set in motion only at the behest of the aggrieved individual or, in the alternative, by his
or her immediate family members or blood relatives. The underlying rationale for such a restriction,
in our opinion, is rooted in the recognition that the freedom to profess, practice, or propagate
religion, and concomitantly the liberty to renounce or embrace a faith of one’s choice, is a facet of
the fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 21 and 25 of the Constitution respectively. This
liberty lies in the innermost domain of human conscience and decisional autonomy. To permit the
initiation of criminal proceedings at the instance of strangers or unrelated third parties would
amount to an impermissible intrusion into this protected sphere of individual freedom and would
open the door to frivolous or motivated litigations, thereby diluting the constitutional guarantees of
personal liberty and freedom of religion. As discussed above, this Court in Shafin Jahan (supra)
underscored that the right to choose a faith or partner is intrinsic to the dignity and autonomy of the
individual.
118. The legislature, in its wisdom, has consciously circumscribed the locus standi for instituting
proceedings, recognising that only the person whose faith is directly in question, or those standing
in proximate familial relation, are in a position to determine whether the act of conversion is the
result of free volition or whether it bears the taint of coercion, fraud, or allurement. An unrelated
third party, having no direct nexus with the individual concerned, is neither competent nor
legitimately placed to assess the voluntariness of such a decision. This Court in Rev. Stainislaus v.
State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors. reported in (1977) 1 SCC 677 clarified that while the right to
propagate religion is protected under Article 25, it does not extend to conversions brought about by
force or fraud. The statutory limitation on who may initiate proceedings, therefore, strikes a balance
by ensuring that genuine grievances of those subjected to unlawful conversion are redressed, while
simultaneously safeguarding the autonomy, dignity, and liberty of individuals from unwarranted
intrusion and misuse of criminal process under the pretext of protecting religious freedom by
persons masquerading as custodians of religion prodded by oblique motivations.
119. It is not in dispute that FIR No. 224/2022 came to be lodged at the behest of a person who does
not fall within any of the categories specified under the unamended Section 4 of the U.P. Conversion
Act. It would not be out of place to mention that one of the seven categories illustratively mentioned
by this Cout in Bhajan Lal (supra) pertains to the FIRs similar to FIR No. 224/2022. The said
category, in the words of this Court, reads thus:
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
59
“(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code
or the concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the
institution and continuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific
provision in the Code or the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the
grievance of the aggrieved party.” (Emphasis supplied)
120. In addition to the legal infirmity going to the very root of the validity of FIR No. 224/2022,
even upon a detailed perusal of the Case Diary and the chargesheet filed by the investigating
authority, we fail to understand as to how the offences alleged in the FIR are made out against the
accused persons.
121. A total of five chargesheets came to be filed after the completion of investigation in FIR No.
224/2022, the details of which are tabulated below:
        S. No. Chargesheet No.     Date                      Offences charged

        4.        60C                  30.09.2023     506, 420, 467, 468, 471,
                                                      120-B IPC
        5.        60D                  28.02.2024     153-A, 506, 420, 467,
                                                      468, 471, 120-B, 34 IPC and 3,
                                                      5 (1) of U.P. Conversion Act
A perusal of the aforesaid chargesheets and relevant Case Diary entries indicates that primarily, the
following material has been collected by the investigating authority in support of its case:
a. Statements of victims;
b. Statements of independent witnesses;
c. Forensic report of the materials recovered in the course of search and seizure.
122. In all the said five chargesheets, the same six persons, namely Pramod Kumar Dixit, Rajesh
Kumar Trivedi, Virendra Kumar, Sanjay Singh, Sri Keshan and Satyapal have been mentioned as the
victims. We have gone through the affidavits of Pramod Kumar Dixit, Sanjay Singh and Rajesh
Kumar Trivedi, all of which are dated 24.05.2022. It is interesting to note that the said three
affidavits have been deposed in an identical fashion, except the name of the deponent. The e-stamp
paper attached to the three affidavits bears the time stamp of 10:54, 10:55 and 10:52 AM
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025

respectively. The only reasonable inference that can be drawn from a perusal of the said three
affidavits submitted by the victim-witnesses is that the same have been prepared in a cyclostyled
manner, with the same draft having been copied and pasted after changing the personal details of
the deponents. We are also at a loss to understand the requirement of submission of affidavits by the
victim-
witnesses to the Superintendent of Police. The scheme provided under the Cr.P.C. does not require
the making of Section 161 statements on oath. As far as statements under Section 164 are concerned,
they are to be made before a judicial officer. It is hardly necessary to mention in such circumstances
that the statements of the victim-witnesses do not inspire any confidence in supporting the
prosecution version contained in the FIR. As a translated copy of the same is not on record, we are
reproducing the original untranslated version of the affidavit submitted by Sanjay Singh
hereinbelow:

123. A perusal of the extract reproduced above to which emphasis has been supplied indicates the
glaring error in the making of the above affidavit. While the name of the deponent is Sanjay Singh,
in paragraph 7 of the affidavit, he has deposed that his name in the Aadhar card was changed from
“Rajesh Kumar Dwivedi” to Rajesh Kumar Samson” by the accused persons.
124. The same error can also be found in paragraph 8 of the affidavit sworn by Pramod Kumar Dixit,
which we are reproducing below:

125. We are of the view that nothing more is required to be said as regards the credibility of the
affidavits submitted by the aforesaid three victim witnesses in light of the discrepancies that we have
adverted to in the preceding paragraph.
126. A reading of the Section 161 Cr.P.C. statement of victim witness Sri Keshan forming part of Case
Diary No. 69 indicates a desperate attempt on the part of the investigating authorities in trying to
overcome the illegality committed in registering FIR No. 224/2022 at the instance of a person not
falling in one of the categories specified in the unamended Section 4 of the U.P. Conversion Act. The
statement is reproduced below:
“Statement of victim/witness: Sh. Keshan, S/o Guru Prasad. Ro Aswar, Tarapur,
Police Station-Malwa, District-Fatehpur. On enquiry stated that I had given my
statement earlier. On 14.04.2022, at the Evangelical Church of India, Hariharganj.
Fatehpur. Pastor Vijay Masih and others converted my religion. I am a victim. A case

had been registered in this regard by the police earlier and I had given my oral
statement when asked by the police. I am giving written complaint. FIR No.
224/2022, P.S.-Kotwali, District-Fatehpur district may be considered as my case
because I am a victim and it is my right to file the case. Thus, giving my statement.”
(Emphasis supplied)
127. We have also perused the Section 161 statements of Virendra Kumar and Sanjay Singh recorded
on 01.12.2023 and 20.11.2022 respectively, forming part of Case Diary Nos. 38 and 29 respectively
and we are dismayed to note that these two statements are also virtually identical to each other. It
evades our understanding as to how Section 161 statements of two victim-witness, recorded more
than a year apart from each other bear such a striking degree of similarity, not just in the version of
the events narrated, but also in the structuring of the sentences, style of narration, and length of the
statement. The only inference that we are able to draw looking at such indistinguishable statements
of victim/witnesses is that the statements have possibly been reproduced from a pre-decided
prototype with change in the personal particulars depending upon the witness making the
statement.
128. At the cost of brevity, we are reproducing the translated versions of the statements of Virendra
Kumar and Sanjay Singh hereinbelow: Further, the statement made by Sanjay Singh in the affidavit
dated 24.05.2022 referred to and reproduced above, and the Section 161 statement reproduced
hereinbelow, are materially different and fail to inspire confidence as regards the veracity of the
version narrated.

129. The statements of a number of other witnesses other than the victim-witnesses were also
recorded during the course of investigation. We have gone through the statements of a number of
such other witnesses as well, however, we are at a loss to understand how these statements would
help the prosecution in establishing its case as alleged in the FIR. To illustrate, the statements of
Rambabu Raidas and Ranjeet Paswan respectively, forming part of CD-120, nowhere mention
anything about the alleged incident of mass religious conversion dated 14.04.2022, relating to which
FIR No. 224/2022 had been registered. Further, the statements of the said two witnesses are
recorded in a similar fashion and merely state that an organization named World Vision used to
frequently visit their villages and conduct events wherein goods were distributed to the members of
the poor and marginalised sections. Pertinently, the witnesses have stated in their statements that
they have not converted themselves from Hinduism to Christianity. We deem it appropriate to
reproduce the statements of Rambabu Raidas and Ranjeet Paswan respectively hereinbelow to
better illustrate our observations:

130. What becomes clear from a perusal of the aforesaid statements of other witnesses is that
neither have these witnesses undergone unlawful religious conversion, nor were they present at the
place of the alleged mass conversion dated 14.04.2022. Further, the allegations of forgery in the
Aadhar cards also lack credible documentary material to support the same. Pertinently, the Aadhar
cards which have been gathered as a part of the Case Diary are different not only in the surnames of
the witnesses, but the photographs of the individuals are also different from the Aadhar cards which
are sought to be portrayed as the “original” cards. What is also pertinent to take note of is that the
investigating authority has failed to attach any report of the competent authority responsible for
issuing Aadhar cards to the effect that the cards seized by the investigating authority are forged and
no such cards have been issued by the competent authority.
131. Further, no offence under the Aadhar Act, 2016 has been added against the accused persons.
We are not oblivious to the fact that there is a procedure for updating the personal details in the
Aadhar cards, and it would be open to an individual who has undergone religious conversion
voluntarily, to suitably get their Aadhar card amended to reflect the desired change in their identity.
In the absence of any material indicating that the Aadhar cards gathered during search and seizure
are forged and not updated ones, we find it difficult to assume the same. Further, mere recovery of
Aadhar cards and card printing machine, does not indicate towards the commission of an offence on
its own in the absence of explicit proof that the setup was being utilized to print forged Aadhar cards
and not the updated ones as per the prescribed procedure, or for printing identity cards of the
students and staff at the institution from where the machine was recovered.
132. The forensic report provided by the respondent no. 1 provides details about the materials seized
by the investigating authorities from the possession of a few of the accused persons, including
mobile phones, hard disks, etc. Most of the videos and images are description of the activities and
drives conducted by an organization by the name World Vision. Pertinently, no material is directly
linked to the incident alleged in FIR No. 224/2022. Moreover, we do not find from a reading of the
U.P. Conversion Act that organization of religious gatherings or doing charity work in the name of
religion has also been made a criminal offence. No provision in the IPC prohibits such activities too.
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
70
No irregularity in the funding of the organization from international sources has been pointed out.
More so, in case of any such irregularity, a number of provisions of the relevant legislations could
have been invoked to deal with an erring organization. However, none of such provisions have been
invoked in the present case. Receiving foreign aid and carrying out charitable work, even in the
name of religion, ipso facto is not a punishable offence under any of the legislations.
133. Thus, in light of the aforesaid discussion on facts as well as law, we are of the view that FIR No.
224/2022 not only suffers from an incurable legal defect, having been lodged by a person not
competent to do the same as per the then prevailing statutory scheme, but also the materials
collected during the course of investigation lack credibility and fall hopelessly short of the standard
necessary for permitting criminal prosecution to proceed on the strength of such materials. We are
fully conscious that when offences are made out from a prima facie reading of the FIR the courts
must exercise restraint in interfering with the continuation of criminal proceedings. However, we
have not only gone through the FIR but also the materials gathered during the course of
investigation. The hands of the Court cannot be said to be tied where on overall view of the matter, it
appears that continuation of criminal proceedings would result in a travesty of justice, even when
the materials gathered may satisfy the ingredients necessary to constitute the offence. The dictum in
Mohamad Wajid (supra) calls upon the courts to read between the lines if the need so arises from an
overall understanding of the circumstances emerging from the record. We have not only gone
through the voluminous materials placed on record by the respondent no. 1 but have also read
between the lines being compelled by the apparent discrepancies as pointed above.
134. In such circumstances, we are of the considered view that the only course that would meet the
ends of justice is to quash the said FIR as well as all consequential legal proceedings emanating
therefrom in exercise of the powers conferred on this Court by Article 32 of the Constitution. vii.
Whether FIR No. 47/2023 and the consequential proceedings arising therefrom are liable to be
quashed?
135. FIR No. 47/2023 was registered on 20.01.2023 at the instance of the complainant viz.,
Sarvendra Vikram Singh, who inter alia alleged that he was unlawfully converted from Hinduism to
Christianity on 25.12.2021. A total of five chargesheets came to be filed after the completion of
investigation in the said FIR dated 19.04.2023, 30.09.2023, 04.11.2023, 01.12.2023 and 18.12.2023
respectively, against a total of 10 accused persons, including the Petitioners in the W.P. (Crl.) No.
123 of 2023, for the offences punishable under Sections 120-B, 420, 467, 468 and 471 of the IPC
respectively, and Section(s) 3, 5(1) and 8(1) of the U.P. Conversion Act respectively.
136. Although the offence pertains to a different alleged incident than the incident alleged in FIR
Nos. 224/22, 54/23, 55/23 and 60/23 respectively, a perusal of the materials on record in the form
of chargesheet and Case Diary brings out striking similarities between the witnesses in the
chargesheet filed in the other FIRs and the chargesheet filed in the FIR in consideration.
137. Besides the statement of the complainant, the Respondent No. 1 has placed reliance on few
statements of independent witnesses and the description of the contents of a video collected by the
investigating authorities and forming part of the Case Diary 18. We have perused the statements and
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
71
also the summary of the video footage. In the video footage summary, it has been described that one
of the accused persons is giving a speech in a gathering. It is alleged therein that the accused is
trying to induce and allure the persons present by offering them property, comfort and wealth.
However, upon translating the contents of the said video summary, we found that the accused
person is referring to a Biblical verse which reads thus – “Psalm 2:8 - Ask me, and I will make the
nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession.” The rest of the content in the video
summary also seems to be a narration from theological excerpts and anecdotes. We are at a loss to
understand as to how such religious gathering could be found to be in contravention to the
provisions of the law, when no direct attempt to allure or induce with a view to cause conversion
could be traced.
138. Further, we have also gone through the statements of the independent witnesses. It is pertinent
to mention that the statements of two witnesses, namely, Jhuri Raidas and Ranjeet Paswan
respectively, recorded on 27.03.2023, are a replica of their Section 161 statements recorded on
26.03.2023 during the investigation of FIR No. 224/2022. The inescapable conclusion that we are
constrained to draw from such mechanical investigation and recording of statements is that of a
severe lack of bona fides. It seems that the entire process of investigation was not an attempt to
uncover the truth of the allegations, but rather to find ways to somehow substantiate the allegations
levelled in the FIR.
139. The inexplicable delay in the registration of FIR Nos. 47, 54, 55 and 60 of 2023 respectively
coupled with the fact that all came to be lodged at a time when the legality of FIR No. 224/2022 had
come under question, alongwith the grave inconsistencies in the materials gathered during the
course of investigation – cyclostyled witness statements across different FIRs;
prototype statement of different witnesses in the same FIR; false affidavits; etc. – have compelled us
to exercise our writ jurisdiction under Article 32 to bring an end to these proceedings.
140. Where the credentials of the investigation are already lacking in genuineness and credibility in
relation to the other FIRs registered at the same police station for similar offences, we are of the
view that it wouldn’t be prudent to allow the continuation of criminal proceedings in relation to the
present FIR as well.
viii. Whether FIR Nos. 55/23 and 60/23 respectively are hit by the principle laid down in T.T.
Antony (supra) and are thus liable to be quashed?
141. As discussed at the outset, despite acknowledging that the contents of FIR Nos. 55 and 60
respectively are virtual reproductions of the allegations made in FIR No. 54/2023, the High Court
refused to quash the same on the ground that the validity of FIR No. 54 had been affirmed by a
coordinate bench of the High Court, in light of the illegality in the registration of FIR No. 224/2022.
142. It is not in dispute that FIR Nos. 54, 55 and 60 of 2023 respectively were lodged at the same
police station within a period of less than 24 hours. Further, except for the relevant particulars of
the complainants, the three FIRs are virtual reproductions of each other and have been registered in
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
72
a cyclostyled manner. It is further not in dispute that all the said three FIRs pertain to the same
alleged incident dated 14.04.2022, which was also the subject matter of FIR No. 224/2022.
143. What is most glaring in FIR Nos. 54 and 55 of 2023 respectively, is that the said FIRs have been
lodged at the instance of two persons who claim to be the victims of mass conversion. However, the
very same persons in their Section 161 Cr.P.C. statement before the Police stated that they were
present with the complainant in FIR No. 224/2022 at the time the alleged offence took place.
144. The learned AG made a submission that FIR Nos. 54, 55 and 60 respectively having been
lodged on the basis of complaints made by three different individuals , i.e., the victims of illegal
conversion, the same cannot be said to be multiple FIRs arising out of the same incident, and thus
there was no infirmity in lodging three different FIRs.
145. In response to the aforesaid submission, Mr. Dave, the learned Senior Counsel, submitted that
the incident dated 14.04.2022 was allegedly an incident of mass conversion said to have been taking
place at the Evangelical Church, Fatehpur. Mass conversion being an offence punishable separately
under Section 5 of the U.P. Conversion Act, all the three incidents pertain to the same alleged
incident of mass conversion and thus, except for the first FIR pertaining to the said incident, all
subsequent FIRs are liable to be quashed.
146. We find force in the submission of Mr. Dave that except for the change in the names of the
complainants, the three FIRs are identical and have also been registered under identical provisions
of the IPC and the U.P. Conversion Act respectively.
147. In the light of the aforesaid discussion on impermissibility of multiple FIRs in relation to the
same incident, we are constrained to hold that FIR Nos. 55/2023 and 60/2023 respectively cannot
stand and ought to be quashed. ix. Whether the High Court committed any error in refusing to
quash FIR No. 54/2023 ?
148. FIR No. 54/2023 came to be registered on the basis of the complaint made by one Virendra
Kumar, who, inter alia, alleged to have been a victim of the mass conversion that took place at the
Evangelical Church, Fatehpur on 14.04.2022. Pertinently, the complaint was made more than nine
months after the alleged incident took place.
149. The petitioners pointed out that a number of statements of the complainant, viz., Virendra
Kumar, were recorded during the course of investigation in FIR No. 224/2022. In his statement
recorded on 15.04.2022, that is, the day of the registration of FIR No. 224/2022, Virendra Kumar
categorically stated that he was one of the persons who had accompanied the informant in FIR No.
224/2022 to the Evangelical Church, Fatehpur, upon receiving information about the alleged
unlawful conversion going on at the Church. Pertinently, the statement of Sanjay Singh was also
recorded along with that of Virendra Singh on 15.04.2022 in which he too stated that he was one of
the persons who had accompanied the informant in FIR No. 224/2022 at the place of the alleged
incident, upon receiving information that unlawful conversion was being carried out at the Church.
What is interesting to note is that Sanjay Singh is the informant/accused in FIR No. 55/2023.

150. The Section 161 Cr.P.C. statement of Virendra Kumar recorded on 15.04.2022 in FIR No.
224/2022 is reproduced hereinbelow:
“Virendra Kumar son of Dinesh Chandra, aged about 23 years, resident of Nappi Ka
Haata, Hariharganj, Police Station Kotwali, District Fatehpur is telling upon asking
that on dated 14.04.2022, the act of religion conversion of the innocent Hindus about
90 in number was running forcibly and fraudulently in the Evangelical Church of
India situated at Hariharganj, which was informed to the Hindu Organizations by the
local people, on receiving the information, Himanshu Dixit, Co-Secretary of the
Vishwa Hindu Parishad (World Hindu Council) reached on the spot along with his all
activists, among whom I was also included, then the act of religious conversion was
going on there.
Himanshu Dixit reported this matter to the Administrative Officers by reaching on the spot and
requested them to come on the spot. When the Administrative Officers reached on the spot then
they interrogated inn this reference from Vijay Masih, father of the Church then the Father Vijay
Masih confessed it that by converting the religion of the Hindus by committing cheat and fraud with
them and converting them into Christianity, we change their documents by tampering with the
documents of their names. The aforesaid religion conversion procedure is running since past 34
days in which all the Hindus are called, the aforesaid procedure completes in 40 days. We attempt to
convert the religion of the patients also came in the Mission Hospital by converting their religion.

District Fatehpur etc., about 20 unknown people were causing the religion conversion of about 90
Hindus along with them. As soon as the aforesaid people received the information of arrival of the
Hindu Organizations and the Administrative Officers, then the aforesaid people caused to take out
them silently from the backdoor. Just it is my statement.” (Emphasis supplied)
151. FIR No. 54/2023 came to be lodged with substantial delay. The only explanation given by the
complainant was that he was afraid of the consequences if he would have reported the incident to
the police. However, a close reading of the materials gathered during the course of investigation
would indicate that the complainant gave a statement to the police on the date of the registration of
FIR No. 224/2022 itself. However, in the said statement, the complainant stated that he was not one
of the victims of mass conversion, rather a member of an organization called the Vishwa Hindu
Parishad and had reached the place of the alleged mass conversion upon receiving information of
the same.
152. We have also referred to the Section 161 Cr.P.C. statement made by Virendra Singh on
01.12.2023 during our discussion on the validity of FIR No. 224/2022.
153. In such circumstances, we cannot help but accept the submission of the appellant(s) that the
subsequent FIR Nos. 54, 55 and 60 of 2023 respectively came to be lodged only with a view to
overcome the infirmity which existed in FIR No. 224/2022 in lieu of the unamended Section 4 of the
U.P. Conversion Act. The mere fact that the complainant in FIR No. 54/2023 had taken a complete
U-turn from the statement he made during the course of investigation in FIR No. 224/2022, and
more so that he, in his earlier statement, admitted having accompanied the informant in FIR No.
224/2022 makes it an easy guess as regards the circumstances in which multiple subsequent FIRs
came to be registered pertaining to the same alleged incident dated 14.04.2022 at the instance of
persons who, after a lapse of considerable time, started to masquerade as the victims of the alleged
unlawful mass conversion.
154. Thus, neither the explanation offered by the complainant in FIR No. 54/2023 can be believed,
nor the allegations of mala fides levelled against him by the appellant(s) can be denied in light of the
Rajendra Bihari Lal vs State Of U.P on 17 October, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/12774401/
75
aforesaid glaring inconsistencies.
155. The criminal law cannot be allowed to be made a tool of harassment of innocent persons,
allowing prosecuting agencies to initiate prosecution at their whims and fancy, on the basis of
completely incredulous material. Having noticed the glaring infirmities, in the registration of FIR
No. 224/2022, it was not open to the police to overcome the difficulty by getting persons with vested
interests to make complaints regarding the same alleged incident after a considerable delay and
thereafter initiate a fresh round of investigation against largely the same set of accused persons.
Unfortunately, this is the only impression which the material on record has left on us.
156. In such circumstances, it would only perpetuate the already committed injustice to allow the
proceedings emanating from FIR No. 54/2023 to continue.
x. Whether FIR No. 538/2023 is liable to be quashed?
157. FIR No. 538/2023 came to be lodged on 11.12.2023 for the offence punishable under Section(s)
307, 386, 504 of the IPC respectively, and Sections 3 r/w 5(1) of the U.P. Conversion Act
respectively. At the outset, we may state that the said FIR was also lodged at a time when the
unamended Section 4 of the U.P. Conversion Act occupied the field. A plain reading of the contents
of the FIR and the allegations made therein clearly indicates that it is not the case of the
complainant therein that he was subjected to illegal conversion by the accused person, or there was
any such attempt regarding the same. Instead, the accusation was that the accused persons were
indulging in unlawful conversion of gullible persons by exercising illegal means. Thus, even if the
allegations of the complainant are taken at their face value, an FIR for the offence under the U.P.
Conversion Act could not have been lodged on the basis of the complaint made by the complainant
in light of the embargo contained in the unamended Section 4 of the U.P. Conversion Act. Our
discussion in the preceding parts of this judgment on the validity of FIR No. 224/2022 will equally
apply to the present FIR as well. Thus, it can be said without doubt that the offences under the U.P.
Conversion Act, i.e., Section(s) 3 and 5(1) respectively in FIR No. 538/2023 cannot stand the
scrutiny of law and must give way to quashing.
158. However, it is pertinent to note that besides the allegations as regards the involvement of the
Petitioner in activities pertaining to unlawful religious conversion, the complainant has also alleged
in the FIR under consideration that the Petitioner had fired a shot using a firearm against him with
the intention to kill and also demanded money from him by use of criminal force.
159. The Petitioner has brought on record certain affidavits in his petition. The affidavits have been
affirmed by the witnesses whose statements have been made a part of the Case Diary and are
addressed to the Superintendent of Police. A common allegation made in all the affidavits is that the
Section 161 Cr.P.C. statements recorded by the police under the name of the said deponents have
been recorded without their knowledge. The deponents have further deposed in favour of the
innocence of the accused. The Petitioner has submitted before us that the said affidavits were not
made a part of the Case Diary despite the allegations that the Section 161 statements have been
falsely recorded.

160. However, we find that the entire chargesheet and case diary is not available on the record. We
are of the view that the matter requires further consideration after the entire set of documents are
placed on the record. Therefore, SLP (Crl.) No. 8615 of 2024 is ordered to be de-tagged from the
present batch for further hearing on the limited aspect of the genuineness of the FIR and
chargesheet insofar as the offences under the IPC are concerned. The interim protection granted
earlier shall continue till the matter is decided.
G. CONCLUSION
161. In light of the aforesaid discussion, we have reached the following conclusion:
a. FIR No. 224/2022 suffers from an incurable legal defect, having been lodged by a
person otherwise not competent in law to do so as per the then prevailing statutory
scheme. In such circumstances, the only course that would meet the ends of justice is
to quash the said FIR as well as all consequential legal proceedings emanating
therefrom, albeit in exercise of the writ jurisdiction under Article 32. Thus, FIR No.
224/2022 dated 15.04.2022 registered with the PS Kotwali, District – Fatehpur and
all the consequential proceedings arising therefrom are hereby quashed.
b. FIR Nos. 55/2023 and 60/2023 respectively registered with the PS Kotwali,
District Fatehpur are squarely covered by the decision of this Court in T.T. Antony
(supra) and for this reason are hereby quashed.
Any consequential proceedings emanating from the said two FIRs shall also stand
terminated.
c. A writ petition under Article 32 seeking quashing of the FIR is maintainable as held
in a catena of decisions of this Court. In the extraordinary facts and circumstances of
the present case, the writ petitions seeking the quashing of FIR Nos. 224/2022 and
47/2023 respectively are not only maintainable but also entertainable and are hereby
allowed. All consequential proceedings emanating from FIR No. 224/2022 and
47/2023 respectively are also hereby quashed.
d. The institution of the complaint and the quality of the material gathered by the
investigating authorities during the course of investigation into FIR No. 54/2023 fail
to inspire any confidence as regards the bona fide of the investigation, thereby
making it a fit case for us to quash the FIR and all consequential proceedings
emanating therefrom. FIR No. 54/2023 and all consequential proceedings arising
therefrom are hereby quashed.
e. The High Court committed an error in declining to quash FIR No. 538/2023 to the
extent that no offence under the U.P. Conversion Act could be said to have been made
out in view of the embargo contained in Section 4 of the U.P. Conversion Act.
However, we clarify that insofar as FIR for the alleged offences under Sections 307,

386 and 504 of the I.P.C. respectively is concerned, the matter requires further
consideration once all the relevant documents are brought on record and is thus
ordered to be de-tagged from the present batch. The interim protection granted to
the Petitioner earlier by this Court shall continue till the matter is finally heard and
decided.
162. The Registry is directed to list SLP (Crl.) No. 8615 of 2024 before this very Bench after
obtaining necessary orders from Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India.
163. The appeal(s)/petition(s) stand allowed in the aforesaid terms.
164. Pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of.
165. No order as to costs.
166. Before we part with the matter, we must place on record our appreciation for the efforts put in
by the learned counsel appearing for the parties, including their office juniors and staff members, in
providing us with structured compilations of all the documents, submissions and judgments
relevant for deciding the present batch of matters.
