5. Learned trial Court after conclusion of trial, convicted the accused / petitioner for the offence
punishable under section under section 379 of IPC and sentenced him to undergo rigorous
imprisonment for Three months with fine of Rs. 500/- and in default of payment of fine, further
ordered to undergo one month rigorous imprisonment, which was affirmed by the learned Sessions
Judge, Ashoknagar (M.P.) vide judgment dated 29/03/2012 passed in criminal appeal No. 11/2012.
Being aggrieved by the impugned judgment dated 29/03/2012 passed in criminal appeal No.
11/2012, the accused / petitioner has filed the instant writ petition.
6. Learned counsel for the accused/petitioner argued that petitioner has falsely been implicated in
the case. It is further argued that there are omissions and contradictions in the evidence of the
prosecution witnesses. It is further submitted that prosecution has not examined any independent
witness, but only interested witnesses have been examined. It is further argued that petitioner aged
about 38 years is facing the criminal proceedings from the date of incident i.e. 2009 to till date and
is suffering physically and mentally for the same and has already served total imprisonment of
Twenty one days out of total awarded jail sentence of Three months. In support of his contentions,
learned counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance upon the judgments delivered by the Apex
Court in the case of V.K. Verma vs. Central Bureau of Investigation reported in (2014) 3 SCC 485, in
the case of Surendran vs. Sub - Inspector of Police reported in AIR 2021 SC 3197 and also in the case
of Rameshwar Singh vs. State of M.P. delivered by co-ordinate Bench of this Court vide order dated
16/01/2023 passed in Cr.R. No. 819/2009. On these grounds, it is prayed that the writ petition filed
by the petitioner deserves to be allowed and the judgment of conviction deserves to be set aside.
7. In alternative leaned counsel for the petitioner submits that petitioner was in jail for 21 days
including pre and post conviction period and the jail sentence was suspended by this Court vide
order dated 12/04/2012. It is submitted that looking to the nature of offence and the fact that
petitioner has already served 21 days of jail sentence and the long protracted litigation, the same
may be reduced to the period already undergone and the amount of fine may reasonably be
enhanced.
8. Learned counsel for respondent / State submits that after due appreciation of evidence, learned
Courts below have found the offence proved against the petitioner, which requires no interference. It
is submitted that the writ petition filed by the petitioner be dismissed.
9. From perusal of the record, this Court is of the view that no illegality has been committed by the
learned Courts below in convicting the petitioner, hence the judgment of conviction passed by the
learned Courts below require no interference and is hereby maintained.
10. The Apex Court in the case of Ashok Kumar vs. State (Delhi Administration) reported in (1980) 2
SCC 282 has held as under:-
"the commission of offence of theft was committed in 1971 and the judgment of this
Court was delivered in 1980. The conviction was under Section 411 IPC. This Court
having regard to the purpose of punishment and "the long protracted litigation",
reduced the sentence to the period already undergone by the convict."

11. The Apex Court in the case of Sharvan Kumar vs State Of Uttar Pradesh reported in (1985) 3 SCC
658 has held as under:-
"the commission of offence was in 1968 and the judgment was delivered in 1985. The
conviction was under Sections 467 and 471 IPC. In that case also, the long delay in
the litigation process was one of the factors taken into consideration by this Court in
reducing the sentence to the period already undergone."
12. Similarly, the Apex Court in the case of Surendran vs. Sub - Inspector of Police reported in AIR
2021 SC 3197 has held as under:-
"10. The incident took place on 16.02.1995 i.e. more than 26 years ago. It appears
that appellant was throughout on the bail. The Trial Court after marshalling the
evidence has recorded the conviction under Section 279, 338 and awarded sentence
of imprisonment of six months and further sentenced to pay a fine of Rs.500/- under
Section
11. We do not find any error in conviction recorded by the Trial Court. The conviction
of appellant is affirmed, however, looking to the facts and circumstances of the
present case specially the fact that 26 years have elapsed from the incident, we are
inclined to substitute the sentence of six months imprisonment under Section 279
and 338 into fine. Six months sentence under Section 279 and 338 IPC are
substituted by fine of Rs.1000/- each whereas sentence of fine under Section 337 IPC
is maintained."
13. So far as the period of sentence is concerned and the nature of offence and the fact that
petitioner who is aged about 38 years is facing the criminal proceedings since 20/03/2009 and the
purpose would be served in case the jail sentence awarded to the petitioner is reduced to the period
already undergone. However, the amount of fine is hereby enhanced upto Rs. 2,000/- for offence
under section 379 of IPC, total enhanced amount is Rs. 2,000/- only.
14. In the result, this writ petition is partly allowed. The findings of conviction are hereby
maintained with the modification to the extent that the jail sentence awarded to the petitioner is
reduced to the period already undergone subject to depositing additional fine amount of Rs. 1,500/-
within a period of two months, failing which, the petitioner shall suffer jail sentence awarded by the
learned Court below. Petitioner is on bail. His bail bond stands discharged.
15. With the aforesaid modification, the instant writ petition stands disposed of.
16. All interlocutory applications, if any, stand disposed of.
Certified Copy as per rules.
