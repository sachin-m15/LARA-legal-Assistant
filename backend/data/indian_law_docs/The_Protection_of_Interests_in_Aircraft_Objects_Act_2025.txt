Default Remedies
Article 8
Remedies of chargee
1.In the event of default as provided in Article 11, the chargee may, to the extent that the chargor has
at any time so agreed and subject to any declaration that may be made by a Contracting State under
Article 54, exercise any one or more of the following remedies:(a)take possession or control of any
object charged to it;(b)sell or grant a lease of any such object;(c)collect or receive any income or
profits arising from the management or use of any such object.2.The chargee may alternatively
apply for a court order authorising or directing any of the acts referred to in the preceding
paragraph.3.Any remedy set out in sub-paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of paragraph 1 or by Article 13 shall
be exercised in a commercially reasonable manner. A remedy shall be deemed to be exercised in a
commercially reasonable manner where it is exercised in conformity with a provision of the security
agreement except where such a provision is manifestly unreasonable.4.A chargee proposing to sell
or grant a lease of an object under paragraph 1 shall give reasonable prior notice in writing of the
proposed sale or lease to:(a)interested persons specified in Article 1(m)(i) and (ii); and(b)interested
persons specified in Article 1(m)(iii) who have given notice of their rights to the chargee within a
reasonable time prior to the sale or lease.5.Any sum collected or received by the chargee as a result
of exercise of any of the remedies set out in paragraph 1 or 2 shall be applied towards discharge of
the amount of the secured obligations.6.Where the sums collected or received by the chargee as a
result of the exercise of any remedy set out in paragraph 1 or 2 exceed the amount secured by the
security interest and any reasonable costs incurred in the exercise of any such remedy, then unless
otherwise ordered by the court the chargee shall distribute the surplus among holders of
subsequently ranking interests which have been registered or of which the chargee has been given
notice, in order of priority, and pay any remaining balance to the chargor.
Article 9
Vesting of object in satisfaction; redemption
1.At any time after default as provided in Article 11, the chargee and all the interested persons may
agree that ownership of (or any other interest of the chargor in) any object covered by the security
interest shall vest in the chargee in or towards satisfaction of the secured obligations.2.The court
may on the application of the chargee order that ownership of (or any other interest of the chargor
in) any object covered by the security interest shall vest in the chargee in or towards satisfaction of
the secured obligations.3.The court shall grant an application under the preceding paragraph only if
the amount of the secured obligations to be satisfied by such vesting is commensurate with the value
of the object after taking account of any payment to be made by the chargee to any of the interested
The Protection of Interests in Aircraft Objects Act , 2025

8
persons.4.At any time after default as provided under Article 11 and before sale of the charged object
or the making of an order under paragraph 2, the chargor or any interested person may discharge
the security interest by paying in full the amount secured, subject to any lease granted by the
chargee under Article 8(1)(b) or ordered under Article 8(2). Where, after such default, the payment
of the amount secured is made in full by an interested person other than the debtor, that person is
subrogated to the rights of the chargee.5.Ownership or any other interest of the chargor passing on a
sale under Article 8(1)(b) or passing under paragraph 1 or 2 of this article is free from any other
interest over which the chargee’s security interest has priority under the provisions of Article 29.

in Article 11, the conditional seller or the lessor, as the case may be, may:(a)subject to any

authorising or directing either of these acts.
Article 11
Meaning of default

default or otherwise give rise to the rights and remedies specified in Articles 8 to 10 and 13.2.Where
the debtor and the creditor have not so agreed, “default” for the purposes of Articles 8 to 10 and 13
means a default which substantially deprives the creditor of what it is entitled to expect under the

provisions of this Chapter as set out in Article 15.

the form of such one or more of the following orders as the creditor requests:(a)preservation of the
object and its value;(b)possession, control or custody of the object;(c)immobilisation of the object;
and(d)lease or, except where covered by sub-paragraphs (a) to (c), management of the object and

creditor:(a)in implementing any order granting such relief, fails to perform any of its obligations to
the debtor under this Convention or the Protocol; or(b)fails to establish its claim, wholly or in part,
on the final determination of that claim.3.Before making any order under paragraph 1, the court

Chapter VIII
Effects of an international interest as against third parties
Article 29
Priority of competing interests
1A registered interest has priority over any other interest subsequently registered and over an
unregistered interest.2.The priority of the first-mentioned interest under the preceding paragraph
applies,—(a)even if the first-mentioned interest was acquired or registered with actual knowledge of
the other interest; and(b)even as regards value given by the holder of the first-mentioned interest
with such knowledge.3.The buyer of an object acquires its interest in it,—(a)subject to an interest
registered at the time of its acquisition of that interest; and(b)free from an unregistered interest
even if it has actual knowledge of such an interest.4.The conditional buyer or lessee acquires its
interest in or right over that object,—(a)subject to an interest registered prior to the registration of
the international interest held by its conditional seller or lessor; and(b)free from an interest not so
registered at that time even if it has actual knowledge of that interest.5.The priority of competing
interests or rights under this Article may be varied by agreement between the holders of those
interests, but an assignee of a subordinated interest is not bound by an agreement to subordinate
that interest unless at the time of the assignment a subordination had been registered relating to
that agreement.6.Any priority given by this Article to an interest in an object extends to
proceeds.7.This Convention,—(a)does not affect the rights of a person in an item, other than an
object, held prior to its installation on an object if under the applicable law those rights continue to
exist after the installation; and(b)does not prevent the creation of rights in an item, other than an
object, which has previously been installed on an object where under the applicable law those rights
are created.

Article affects,—(a)any rules of law applicable in insolvency proceedings relating to the avoidance of
a transaction as a preference or a transfer in fraud of creditors; or(b)any rules of procedure relating
to the enforcement of rights to property which is under the control or supervision of the insolvency
administrator.

a partial assignment of the assignor’s associated rights. In the case of such a partial assignment the
assignor and assignee may agree as to their respective rights concerning the related international
interest assigned under the preceding paragraph but not so as adversely to affect the debtor without
its consent.3.Subject to paragraph 4, the applicable law shall determine the defences and rights of
set-off available to the debtor against the assignee.4.The debtor may at any time by agreement in
writing waive all or any of the defences and rights of set-off referred to in the preceding paragraph

assignment by way of security, the assigned associated rights revest in the assignor, to the extent
that they are still subsisting, when the obligations secured by the assignment have been discharged

1.An assignment of associated rights transfers the related international interest only if it,—(a)is in
writing;(b)enables the associated rights to be identified under the contract from which they arise;
and(c)in the case of an assignment by way of security, enables the obligations secured by the
assignment to be determined in accordance with the Protocol but without the need to state a sum or
maximum sum secured.2.An assignment of an international interest created or provided for by a
security agreement is not valid unless some or all related associated rights also are assigned.3.This
Convention does not apply to an assignment of associated rights which is not effective to transfer the
related international interest.

accordance with Articles 31 and 32, the debtor in relation to those rights and that interest is bound
by the assignment and has a duty to make payment or give other performance to the assignee, if but
only if,—(a)the debtor has been given notice of the assignment in writing by or with the authority of
the assignor; and(b)the notice identifies the associated rights.2.Irrespective of any other ground on
which payment or performance by the debtor discharges the latter from liability, payment or
performance shall be effective for this purpose if made in accordance with the preceding
paragraph.3.Nothing in this Article shall affect the priority of competing assignments.
Article 34
Default remedies in respect of assignment by way of security
In the event of default by the assignor under the assignment of associated rights and the related
international interest made by way of security, Articles 8, 9 and 11 to 14 apply in the relations
between the assignor and the assignee (and, in relation to associated rights, apply in so far as those

obligation and the security interest were references to the obligation secured by the assignment of
the associated rights and the related international interest and the security interest created by that
assignment;(b)to the chargee or creditor and chargor or debtor were references to the assignee and
assignor;(c)to the holder of the international interest were references to the assignee; and(d)to the
object were references to the assigned associated rights and the related international interest.
Article 35
Priority of competing assignments
1.Where there are competing assignments of associated rights and at least one of the assignments
includes the related international interest and is registered, the provisions of Article 29 apply as if
the references to a registered interest were references to an assignment of the associated rights and
the related registered interest and as if references to a registered or unregistered interest were
references to a registered or unregistered assignment.2.Article 30 applies to an assignment of
associated rights as if the references to an international interest were references to an assignment of
the associated rights and the related international interest.
Article 36
Assignee’s priority with respect to associated rights
1.The assignee of associated rights and the related international interest whose assignment has been
registered only has priority under Article 35(1) over another assignee of the associated rights:(a)if
the contract under which the associated rights arise states that they are secured by or associated
with the object; and(b)to the extent that the associated rights are related to an object.2.For the

advanced and utilised for the purchase of the object;(b)a sum advanced and utilised for the purchase
of another object in which the assignor held another international interest if the assignor transferred
that interest to the assignee and the assignment has been registered;(c)the price payable for the
object;(d)the rentals payable in respect of the object; or(e)other obligations arising from a
transaction referred to in any of the preceding sub-paragraphs.3.In all other cases, the priority of the
competing assignments of the associated rights shall be determined by the applicable law.

the debtor were references to the assignor.
Article 38

the related international interest by legal or contractual subrogation under the applicable law.2.The
priority between any interest within the preceding paragraph and a competing interest may be

subordinated interest is not bound by an agreement to subordinate that interest unless at the time of
the assignment a subordination had been registered relating to that agreement.
