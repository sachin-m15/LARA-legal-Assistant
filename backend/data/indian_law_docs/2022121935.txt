ue Govnrument of India non muted a Commission on Retie...) of Administrative

Commission contains renommendations for repeal/amendments of laws a Tel regulations. 
 
Paragraph 16 9 5 st thee at follows: 
"The Commisthon also recommends the repeal of about 90C Appropriation Acts 
passed by Parliament from time to time Since. 1950 as they are, in terra temporary in 
aatuth" 
According to the instructions in die Statement of Case, this recommendation of she 
Commission has been exthathed Sty the thithistry of Fintuthe and the Ministith of Law. The 
tffinistry of Finance is nth M favor of repeat of these Acts as, sees-riding to if this will 
remove the legal cover to the disbursements made over the years 1312:1Cli the unwary of these 
Acts The Legislateere Department also supports this view. The Deprtramt of Legal Affairs, 
on the other hand, is or rie opinion that even if th 	
_ opnantm Acts are tepealed, acts 
dune under them would he saved by virthe of Section 6 of the Genet ai Clauses Act. 
Ithe. Case for Option is refertea to me in tha aforesaid circumstances. 
 
lie basic quesoon tube deteoutned is whether the Apprthratton Acts art temocffith 
stansl es o. permanent statutes. 
 
On n *in reading of the Appropriation Acs it is dear that the. sane are not of a 
Simited duration by the terms of the statute There is no period prescribed for their open:unit 
whereafter they expires by efflux. ffitime 
-3- 
If one Ionics at hie ptermble. and De Impose of De AppropriationAct h is certainly 
 
arguable lime one feature of these Acts is hut their &rattan is expected to be tempora, 
that, these Acts become spent when all the pant circumstances with which they are designed 
to deal have Seen dealt With SeeFrancis BeEnion: Statutomp
r tet 	
t (261 edn) rage

:however, Lite Supreme CouM1 has taken the view that where no fixed dmatton of Act 
rifled it is impossible to hold that merely because of Js preamble an Act becomes a 
temporary Act See Altagai Subra uarmam. Vs St 'e of  P 79(9 (2) SCC 96 at 98 pars 
More specifically, in the case of Ilinance Act OD Supreme Court approved the 
judgement of a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court in.which it was obscured that the 
Finanut Acts though annual Acts are not necessarily temporary Acts for they may and often 
do contain provisions of a general character which ate of a permanent operation. See 
Midurai District Central Co-op Bank Ltd Vs. I.T.D.— 1975 (2) SCC 454 at 460. In this 
connerrion, attention is also invfted to OP. Shugh's Principles of Statutory InlerpreLation (70  
ein) page 458 
In view of these Supreme COM: prottooneements, the Appropriation Acts cannot be 
regarded as temporary statutes. 	
Consequently, the appropriate (muse open to the 
Government is to enact o 0.111prehelliSiNC legislation repealing ail Appropriates': Acts pined 
a schedule to the legislation with an express saving clause in the terms of Section 6 of the 
&meta; Clauses Aot. Such k saving clause would address the apprehensious expressed that 
the repeal or the Appropriation Acts will render all Finance Accounts/Appropriation 
Achorms and Audit Reports laid in both Houses of Parliament con and void. 
hachlentally, I may mention Mut the Am), opriathal Acts do not belong to the category 
of those obsolete law( whose provisions may be invoked at any time and take a citizen by 
surphe and cause him bardship and arassneat Ne Appropriation Acts spend themseisw 
after the particular financial year and the potential of any mischief by theft enforcement 
against a citizen (toes not arise 
2 
-Froatcly 1 cannot nee the utility of :epealing all these Acts. However, that is a mater 
of policy For the .666616m The legal coune open to the Goverment has been indicated 
by me above 
In the light of the ubove, the cialurn posed for my opinion are

Answer 
-Whether a simple repeal of the Appropriation Acts would render all 
the disbunemsnon made and all ether acts done under them as having 
been done without the authority of law or these will be saved by virtue 
of section 6 ofte General Clausen Act? 
An express loving clause would not atTect the grants end

such a company be dismantled withenz some kind of parlbamenzard

:or the safeguard of their rights and interescs. The 
fommission was required to recommend measures and 
institutional arrangements to prevent misuse of powers by the 
police, by administrative or executive instructions, political or 
other pressures or oral orders Of any type, which are contrary 
CO law, for the quick and impartial inquiry of public complaints 
made against the police about any misuse of police powers. 
The Chairman of the Commission was a renowned and highly 
reputed former Governor. A retired High Court Judge, two

various semina rs held, research studies conducted, meetings 
and discussions held with the Governors, Chief Ministers, 
aspector Generals of Police, State Inspector Generals ot Police 
and first or Police organizations. The Commission submitted 
Cs first report in February 1979, second in August 1979, three 
reports each in the years 1980 and 1981 including the final 
report in 
 May 1981. 
its first report, the Commission first dealt with the 
modalities for inquiry into complaints of police misconduct in 
' manner which will carry credibility and satisfaction to the 
sublic regarding their fairness and impartiality and 
rectification of serious deficiencies which militate against their 
unctioning efficiently to public satisfaction and advised the 
government for expeditious examination ot recommendations 
Pox' immediate implementation. The Commission observed that 
Lncreasing crime, rising population, growing pressure of living 
accommodation, particularly,  in urban areas, violent 
utbursns in the wake of demonstrations and agitations 
prising from labour disputes, the agrarian unrest, problems 
and difficulties of students, political activities including the 
ult of extremists, enforcement of economic and social 
Legislation etc. have all added new dimensions to police tasks 
9 1.1 the country and tended to 'wring the police in confrontation 
vith the public much more frequently than ever before. The 
pasic and fundamental problem regarding police taken note of 
as as to how to make them functional as an efficient and 
Lmpartial law enforcement agency fully motivated and guided 
ly the Objectives of service to Che public at large, upholding 
he constitutional rights and liberty of the people. Various 
recommendations were made. 
the second report. it was noticed that the crux of the 
police reform is to secure professzonal independence for the 
police to funation truly and efficiently as an impartial agent of 
he law of the land and, at the same time, to enable the 
1overnment to oversee the police performance to ensure its 
ssntormity to the law. A supervisory mechanism without 
cope for illegal, irregular or mala tide interference wich police 
ft:notions has to be devised. It was earnestly hoped that the 
spvernment would examine and publish the report 
mpeditiously so that :he process for implementation of various 
vcommendations made therein could start right away. The 
vport, inter alia, noticed the P  henomenon of frequent and 
Aidiscriminate transfers ordered on political considerations as 
dso other unhealthy influences and pressures brought to hear 
m police and, inter alias recommended for the Chief of Police 
m a State, statutory tenure of office by including it in a 
specific provision in the Police Fa: itself and also 
recommended the preparation of a panel of IPS officers for 
}eating as Chiefs of Police in States. The report also 
recommended  the c 	
of Statutory Commission

onstitution 
 
n of which shall include laying

down

sa also functioning as a forum of appeal for disposing of 
wpresentaxions from any Police officer of the rank of 
Wperintendent of Police and above, regarding his being 
objected to illegal or irregular orders in the performance of 
as dueies. 
With the 9th and final report, certain basic reforms for the 
 
'ffectiye functioning of the police to enable as to promote the 
bmavic role of law and to render impartial service to the 
wonle were recommended and a draft new Police Act

The petition sets out the historical background giving 
pasons why the police functioning has caused so much 
lisenchanhment and dissatisfaction. It also sess out 
poommendarions of various Committees whichh were never

Since the misuse and abuse of police has

The petitioners seek that Union of India be directed to re-
define the role and functions of the Police and frame a new 
olice Act on the lines of the model Act drafted by the National 
Police Commassion in order to ensure that the police is made 
ccountable essentially and primarily to the law of the land 
of
and the people. Directions are also sought against the Union 
India and State Governments to constitute various 
pmmissions and Boards laying down the policies and 
ensuring that police perform their duties and functions free 
frm any pressure and also for separation of investigation

have already been recommended in order t 
reserve the integrity of the investigating 
process and to insulate it from 'extraneous 
mEuetces 
In the above noted letter dated 3rd April, 1997 sent to all 
he State Governments, the Home Minister while echoing the 
overall popular perception that there has been a general fall in 
the performance of the police as alsoa deterioration in the 
olicing system as a whole in the country, expressed that time 
had comm to rise above limited perceptions to bring about 
7ome drastic changes in the shape of reforms and 
restructuring of the police before the country is overtaken by 
unhealthy developments. it was expressed that the popular 
exception all over the country appears to be that many of the 
deficiencies in the functioning of the police had arisen largely 
to an overdose of unhealthy and petty political 
pnterference at various levels starting from transfer and 
posting of policemen of different ranks, misuse oX police for 
artisan purposes and political patronage quite often extended 
to corrupt police personnel. The Union Home Minister 
expressed the view that rising above narrow and partisan 
onsiderations, it is of great national importance to insulate 
the police from the growing tendency of partisan or political 
Xiterference in the discharge of its lawful functions of 
prevention and control of crime including investigation of 
:a see and maintenance of public order. 
Eesides the Home Minister, all the Commissions and 
Xommittees above noted, have broadly come to _ice 
 ame 
Penclusion on the issue of urgent need for police reforms. 
there is convergence of views on the ned to have (a) State 
5eourity Commission at State level; Inl et 
 ransparent procedure 
or the appointment of Police Chief and the desirability of 
jiving him a minimum fixed tenure) (c) separation of 
tnvestigation work from law and order; and Id) a new Police Act 
hich should reflect the democratic aspirations of the peonle. 
Et has been contended that a statutory State Security 
'ommission with Xis recommendations binding on the 
iovernment should have been established long before. The 
reprehension expressed is that any Commission without 
hying its report binding effect would be ineffective. 
>Tire than 25 years back i.e. In August 1979, the Police 
iormission Report recommended thaw the investigation task 
hiculd be beyond any kind of intervention by the executive or 
ion-executive. 
For separation of investigation work from law and order 
:yen the Law Commission of India in its 154th .Report had 
pecommended such separation to ensure speedier 
hvhstigation, better expertise) 
xpertise and improved rapport with the 
People without of-course any water tight compartmentalization 
view of both functions being closely inter-related at the 
'round level. 
The Sorabjee Committee has also recommended 
htablishment of a State Bureau of Criminal Investigation by 
he State Governments under the charge of a Director who 
'hall report to the Director General of Police. 
h most of the reports, for appointment and posting, 
ponstitution of a Police Establishment Board has been 
ended comprising of the Director General of Police of 
Tie State and four ether senior officers. 	
Is has peen further 
hcommended that there should be a Public Complaints 
mthority at district level to examine the complaints from the 
mblIc on police excesses, arbitrary arrests and detentions, 
'alse implications in oriminai cases, custodial violence etc. and 
or making necessary recommendations.

Undoubtedly and undisputedly, the Cssion did 
ommendable work and after in depth 
ommi 
 
stud Y, made very useful 
recommendations. After waiting for nearby 1S years, this 
netition was filed. More than ten years have elapsed since this 
cetition was filed. Even during this period, on more or less 
similar lines, recommendations for police reforms have been 
ade by other high powered committees as above noticed. 
The sorabjee Committee has also p repared a draft revert. We 
have no doubt that the said Committee would also make very 
seful recommendations and come out with a model new 
Police Act for consideration of the Central and the State 
'overnments. We have also no doubt that Sorabjee 
Committee Report and the new Act will receive due attention of 
the Central Government which may recommend to the State t1 
 to consider passing of State Acts on the 
suggested lines. We expect that the State Governments would 
sive it due consideration and would pass suitable legislations 
in recommended lines. the police being a State subject under 
the Constitution of India. The question, however, is whether 
his Cour: should further wait for Governments to take 
suitable steps for police reforms. The answer has to be in the 
negative. 
caving regard to ME the gravity of the problem; (ii) the 
urgent need for preservation and strengthening of Rule of Law; 
the
pendency of even this petition for last over ten year 	
(iv) 
che fact that various Commissions and Committees have made 
recommendations on similar lines for introducing reforms in 
he police set-up in the country; and (v) total uncertainty as to 
when police reforms would be introduced, we think that there 
marmot be any further wait, and the stage has come for issue 
of appropriate directions for immediate compliance so as to be 
operative till such cime a new model Police Act is prepared by 
be Central Government andbor the State Governments pass 
the requisite legislations. It may further be noted that the 
quality of Criminal Justice System in the country, to a large 
cctent, depends upon the working of the police force. Thus, 
having regard to the larger public interest, it is absolutely 
bcessary to issue the requisite directions; Nearly ten years 
sack, in Vineet Narain Ors. v. Union of India a Arr. 
[(19913) 1 SCC 226], this Court noticed the urgent need for the 
Mate Governments to set up the recuisite mechanism and 
directed the Central Government to pursue the matter of 
colicc reforms with the Stare Governments and ensure the 
Jetting up of a mechanism for selection/appointment, tenure, 
transfer and posting of not merely the Chief of the State Police 
sit also all police officers of the rank of superintendents of 
police and above. The Court expressed its shock that in some 
States the tenure of a superintendent of Police is for a few 
canths and transfers are made for whimsical reasons which 
has not only demoralizing effect on the police force but is also 
Ilien to the envisaged constitutional macinery) it was 
observed that apart from demoralizing got-hem 
 lice force, it has 
also the adverse effect of politicizing the personnel and, 
,herefore, it is essential that prompt measures are taken by 
the Central Covernmenc. 
The Court then observed that no action within the 
constitutional scheme found necessary to remedy the situation 
is too stringent in these circumstances. 
lore than four years have also lapsed since the report 
above noted was submieted by the National Human Rights 
co-mission to the Government of India. 
The preparation of a model Police Act by the Central 
Government and enactment of new Police Acts by State 
Governments providing therein for the composition of State 
Security Commission are things, sb can onfy hope ror the

present. Similarl y, we can only express our hope that all State 
°Tenements would rise to the occasion and enact a new 
Police Act wholly insulating the police from any pressure 
ohatsoever thereby placing in position an important measure 
_or securing the rights of the citizens under rhea 
 
for the Rule of Law, treating everyone equal and being partisan 
o none, which will also help in securing an efficient and better 
criminal justice delivery system. It is not possible or proper to 
leave this matter only with an expression of this hope and to 
w it developments further, it is essential to lay down 
Sguidelines to be operative :ill the new legislation is enacted by 
he State Governments. 
Article 32 read with Article 142 of the Constitution 
empowers this Court to issue such directions, as may he 
ecessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter. 
All authorities are mandated by Article 144 to act in aid of the 
,rders passed by this Court. The decision in Vineet Napalm's 
case ;supra) notes various decisions of this Court where 
guidelines and directions to be observed were issued in 
bsence of legislation and implemented till legislatures pass 
appropriate legislations. 
With the assistance of learned counsel for the parties, we

JUDGMENT: 
JUDGMENT 1997 (2) SCR 1186 A.M. Abmadi, C.J • 
1. The special leave petitions, civil appeals and writ petitions which together constitute the present 
batch of matters before us owe their origin to separate decisions of different High Courts and several 
provisions in different enactments which have been made the subject of challenge. Between them, 
they raise several distinct questions of law; they have, however been grouped together as all of them 
involve the consideration of the following broad issues: 
(1) Whether the power conferred upon Parliament or the Stale Legislatures, as the ease may be, by 
Sub-clause (d) of Clause (2) of Article 323A or by Sub-clause (d) of Clause (3) of Article 32313 of the 
Constitution, totally exclude the jurisdiction of 'all courts', except that of the Supreme Court under 
Arfide 136, in respect of disputes and complaints referred to in Clause (1) of Article 323A or with 
regard to all or any of the matters specified in Clause (2) of Article 3230, runs counter to the power 
ofjudicial review conferred on the High Courts under Articles 226/227 and on the Supreme Court 
under Article 32 of the Constitution? 
(2) Whether the Tribunals, constituted either under Article 323A or under Article 3238 of the 
Constitution, possess the competence to test the constitutional validity of a statutory provision/rule? 
(3) Whether these Tribunals, as they are functioning at present, can be said to be effective 
substitutes for the High Courts in discharging the power of judicial review? If not, what are the 
changes required to make them conform to their founding objectives? 
2. We shall confine ourselves to the larger issues raised in this batch of matters without adverting to 
the specific facts of each of the matters; we shall, however, selectively refer to some of the impugned 
decisions and the provisions involved to the extent we find it necessary to do so in order to

appreciate the policy- conflicts in, and to draw the parameters of, the controversy before us. The 
broad principles enunciated in this judgment will, at a later time, be applied by a Division Bench to 
resolve the disputes involved in each of the individual cases. 
3. The present controversy has been referred to us by an order of a Division Bench of this Court, 
reported in : (1995)IILI.T64oSC , which concluded that the decision rendered by a five-Judge 
Constitution Bench of this Court in S P Sampath Kumar v Union of India : (1687)ILLhaBSC , 
needs to be comprehensively reconsidered. The order of the Division Bench, dated December 2, 
1994, was rendered after it had considered the arguments in the first matter before us, CA. No. 481 
of 1989, where the challenge is to the validity of Section 5(6) of the Administrative Tribunals Act, 
1985. After analysing the relevant constitutional provisions and the circumstances which led to the 
decision in Sampath KilnlatiS case, the referring Bench reached the conclusion that on account of 
the divergent views expressed by this Court in a series of cases decided after Sampath Kumafs case, 
the resulting situation warranted a "fresh look by a larger Bench over all the issues adjudicated by 
this Court in Sampath Kumar's case including the question whether the Tribunal can at all have an 
Administrative Member on its Bench, if it were to have the power of even deciding constitutional 
validity of a statute or (Article) 309 rule, as conceded in Chopra's case". The "post- Sampath Kumar 
cases" which caused the Division Bench to refer the present matter to as am as follows:

4. Before we record the contentions of the learned Counsel who appeared before us, we must set out 
the legal and historical background relevant to the present case. 
5. Part XIVA of the Constitution was inserted through Section 46 of the Constitution (42nd 
Amendment) Act, 1976 with effect from Mardi 1,1677. It comprises two provisions, Articles 323A 
and 323B, which have, for the war of convenience, been fully extracted hereunder:

6. We may now examine the manner in which these constitutional provisions have been sought to be 
implemented, the problems that have consequently arisen, and the manner in which Courts have 
sought to resolve them. Such an analysis will have to consider the working of the two provisions 
separately. 
Article 323A 
7. In pursuance of the powder conferred upon it by Clause (1) of Article 323A of the Constitution, 
Parliament enacted the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985 (Act 13 of 1935) [hereinafter referred to 
as "the Act']- The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act indicates that it was in the express 
terms of Article 323A of the Constitution and was being enacted because a large number of cases 
relating to service matters were pending before various Courts; it was expected that "the setting up 
of such Administrative Tribunals to deal exclusively with service matters would go a long way in not 
only reducing the burden of the various courts and thereby giving them more time to deal with other 
cases expeditiously but would also protdde to the persons covered by the Administrative Tribunals 
speedy relief in respect of their grievances." 
S. Pursuant to the provisions of the Act, the Central Administrative Tribunal, with five Benches, was 
established on November 1,1955. However, even before the Tribunal had. been established, several 
writ petitions had been filed in various High Courts as well as this Court challenging the 
constitutional validity of Article 323A of the Constitution as also the provisions of the Act; the 
principal violation complained of being the exclusion of the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 
32 of the Constitution and of that of the High Courts under Article 226 of the Constitution. Through 
an interim order dated October 31,1985, reported as.  P Samnath Kumar v. Union of India: 
(1985)4SCC458  , this Court directed the carrying out of certain measures with a view to ensuring the 
functioning of the Tribunal along constitutionally-sound principles. Pursuant to an undertaking 
given to this Court at the interim stage by the erstwhile Attorney General, An amending Act (Act 19 
of 1986) was enacted to bring about the changes prescribed in the aforesaid interim order. 
9. When Sampath Kumar's case was finally heard, these changes had already been incorporated in 
the body and text of the Act. The Court took the view that most of the original grounds of 
challenge-which included a challenge to the constitutional validity of Article 323A - did not survive 
and restricted its focus to tnsting only the constitutional validity of the provision of the Act In its 
final decision, the Court held that though judicial review is a basic feature of the constitution, the 
vesting of the power ofjudicial review in an alternative institutional mechanism, after taking it away 
from the High Courts, would not do violence to the basic structure so long as it was ensured that the 
alternative mechanism:was an effective and real substitute for the High Court. Using this theory of 
effective alternative institutional mechanisms as its foundation, the Court proceeded to analyse the 
protdsions of the Act in order to ascertain whether they passed constitutional muster. The Court 
came to the conclusion that the Act, as it stood at that time did not measure up to the requirements 
of an effective substitute and, to that end, suggested several amendments to the provisions 
governing the form and content of the Tribunal. The suggested amendments were given the force of 
law by an amending Act (Act K. of 1987) after the conclusion of the case and the Act has since 
remained unaltered.

10. We may now analyse the scheme and the salient features of the Act as it stands at the present 
time, inclusive as it is of the changes suggested in Sampath Kumar's case. The Act contains 37 
Sections which are housed in five Chapters. Chapter I ("Preliminary") contains three Sections; 
Section s is the definition clause. 
it. Chapter H ("Establishment of Tribunals and Benches thereof) contains Sections 4 to 13. Section 4 
empowers the Central Government to establish (5) a Central Administrative Tribunal with Benches 
at separate places; (2) an Administrative Tribunal for a State which makes a request in this behalf; 
and (3) a Joint Administrative Tribunal for two or more States which enter into an agreement for 
the purpose. Section 5 states that each Tribunal shall consist of a chairman and such number of 
Vice-Chairmen and Judicial and Administrative Members as may be deemed necessary by the 
appropriate Government Sub-section (2) of Section 5 requires every Bench to ordinarily consist of 
one Judicial Member and one Administrative Member. Sub-section (6) of Section 5, which enables 
the Tribunal to function through Single Member Benches is the focus of some controversy, as will 
subsequently emerge, and is fully extracted as under: 
Section 5(6) - Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing provisions of this section, it 
shall be competent for the Chairman or any other Member authorised by the Chairman in this 
behalf to function as a Bench consisting of a single Member and exercise the jurisdiction powers and 
authority of the Tribunal in respect of such classes of cases or such matters pertaining to such 
classes of cases as the Chairman may by general or special order specify: 
Provided that if at any stage of the hearing of any such case or matter it appears to the Chairman or 
such Member that the case or matter is of such a nature that it ought to be heard by a Bench 
consisting of two Members the case or matter may be transferred by the chairman or, as the case 
may be, referred to him for transfer to such Bench as the Chairman may deem fit. 
12. Section 6 deals with the qualifications of the personnel of the Tribunal. Since the first few 
sub-sections of Section 6 are required to be considered subsequently they may be reproduced 
hereunder: 
6. Qualifications for appointment of Chairman, Arise- Chairman or other Members. - 
(1) A person shall not be qualified for appointment as the Chairman unless he-
(a) is, or has been, a Judge of a High Court; or

at least three years. 
(3-A) A person shall not be qualified for appointment as an Administrative Member unless he-- 
(a) has, for at least two years, held the post of an Additional Secretary to the Government of India or 
any other post under the Central or a State Government carrying a scale of pay which is not less than 
that of an Additional Seffietary to the Government of India; or 
(b) has, for at least three years, held the post of a jobrit Secretary to the Government of India or any 
other post under the Central or a State Government carrying a scale of pay which is not less than 
that of a Joint Secretary to the Government of India. 
and shall, in either case, have adequate administrative experience. 
13. Sub-sections (4), (5) and (6) of Section 6 provide that all the Members of the Central 
Administrative Tribunal, the State Administrative Tribunals and the Joint Administrative Tribunals 
shall be appointed by the President; in the case of the State Administrative Tribunals and the Joint 
Administrative Tribunals, the President is required to consult the concerned Governor(s). 
Sub-section (7) stipulates that the Chief Justice of India is also to be consulted in the appointment of 
the Chairman, Vice- Chairman and Members of all Tribunals under the Act. 
14. Section 8 prescribes the terms of office of the personnel of the Tribunal as being for a duration of 
five years from the date of entering into office; there is also provision for reappointment for another 
term of five years. The maximum age limit permissible for the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman is 
68 years and for that of any other Member is 62 years. Section io stipulates that the salaries, terms 
and conditions of all Members of the Tribunal are to be determined by the central Government; 
such terms are, however, not to be varied to the disadvantage of any Member after his appointment.

authority of Tribunals") consists of Sections 14 to 18. 
Sections 14,13 and 16 deal la bh the jurisdiction, powers and authority of the Central Administrative 
Tribunal, the State Administrative Tribunals and the Joint Administrative Tribunals respectively. 
These provisions make it clear that except for the jurisdiction of this Court, the Tribunals under the 
At will possess the jurisdiction and powers of every other Court in the country in respect of all 
service-related matters. Section 17 provides that the Tribunals under the Act will have the same 
powers in respect of contempt as arc enjoyed by the High Courts. 
16. Chapter IV ("Procedure") comprises Section na to 27. Section 21 specifies strict limitation 
periods and does not vest the Tribunals under the Act with the power to condone delay. 
17. Chapter V ("Miscellaneous"), the final Chapter of the Act, comprising Sections 28 to 37, vests the 
Tribunals under the Act with ancillary powers to aid them in the effective adjudication of disputes. 
Section 28, the "exclusions of Jurisdiction" clause reads as follows: 
28. Exclusion of Jurisdiction of courts.-- On and from the date from which any jurisdiction, powers 
and authority becomes exercisable under this Act by a Tribunal in relation to recruitment and 
matters concerning recruitment to any Service or post or service matters concerning members of 
any Service or persons appointed to any Service or post, no court except-- 
(a) the Supreme Court; or 
(b) any Industrial Tribunal, Labour Court or other authority constituted under the Industrial 
Disputes Act, 1947 or any other corresponding law for the time being in force, Shall have, or be 
entitled to exercise anyjmisdiction, powers or authority in relation to such recruitment or matters 
concerning such recruitment or such service matters. 
18. A facet which is of vital relevance to the controversy before us, and consequently needs to be 
emphasised, is that Section 28, when originally enacted, was in the express terms of Clause (2) (d) of 
Article 323A of the Constitution and the only exception made in it was in respect of the jurisdiction 
of this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution. However, before the final hearing in Sampath 
Kumar's case the provision was further amended to also save the jurisdiction of this Court under 
Article 32 of the Constitution; this aspect has been noted in the judgment of Mishra, J. in Sampath 
Kumar's ease (at pars 14). Since the Court in Sampath Kumar's case had restricted its focus to the 
provisions of the Act, it expressed itself to be satisfied with the position that the power of judicial 
review of the Apex Court had not been tampered with by the provisions of the Act and did not 
venture to address the larger issue of whether Clause (2)(d) of Article 323A of the Constitution also 
required a similar amendment 
sq. Section 29 provides for the transfer to the Tribunals under the Act, of all service matters pending 
in every existing form before their establishment The only exception carved out is in respect of 
appeals pending before High Courts. Section 35 vests the Central Government with rule-making 
powers and Section 36 empowers the appropriate Government to make piles to implement the 
provisions of the Act and the matters specified in it. By virtue of Section 37, the rules made by the 
ham Kafl0011 • InIprindrankanoon orcycloc.1152518/ 
7 
L. Chandra Kumar vs Union O India And Others an 18 March. 1997 
Central Government are required to be laid before Parliament and, in the case of rules made by State 
Governments, before the concerned State Legislature (s). 
20. The Act and its provisions will be analysed in the course of this judgment However, a 
preliminary appraisal of the framework °Mho Act would indicate that it was intended to provide a 
self- contained, almost wholly exclusive (the exceptions being specified in Section 28) forum for 
adjudication of all service related matters. The Tribunals created under the Act were intended to 
perform a substitution role as opposed to - and this distinction is of crucial significance-a 
supplemental role with regard to the High Courts. 
21. According to the information provided to us by Mr. KN. Bhat, the learned Additional Solicitor 
General, apart from the Central Administrative Tribunal which was established on 1.11.1985, eight 
States have set up State Administrative Tribunals, all of which are presently functioning. The States, 
along with the date of establishment of the particular State Administrative Tribunals, are as follows: 
Andhra Pradesh (1. 1.1989), Himachal Pradesh (1.9.1986), Karnataka (6.10.5986), Madhya Pradesh 
(2.8.1988), Maharashtra (8.7.1989), Orissa  (14.7.1986), Tamil Nadu (1212.1988) and west Bengal 
(16.1.1995). 
22. We may now analyse the "post-Sam path Kumar cases" which find mention in the order of the 
referring Bench. In J.B. Chopra's case, a ditision Bench of this Court has occasion to consider one of 
the specific questions that has now arisen for our consideration, viz., whether the Central 
Administrative Tribunal constituted under the Act has the authority and the jurisdiction to strike 
down a rule framed by the President of India under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution as 
being violative of Articles 14 and 1603 of the Constitution. When the matter came up before the 
Division Bench, the issue was still being considered by the Constitution Bench in Sampath Kumar's 
case. The Division Bench, therefore, deferred its judgment till the final pronouncement of the 
decision in Sampath Kumar's case. Thereafter, it analysed the Constitution Bench's decision to 
arrive at the conclusion that "the Administrative Tribunal being a substitute of the High Court had 
the necessary jurisdiction, power and authority to adjudicate upon all disputes relating to service 
matters including the power to deal with all question pertaining to the constitutional validity or 
otherwise of such laws as offending Article 14 and 5601) of the Constitution." 
23. An aspect which needs to be emphasised is that the Constitution Bench in Sampath Kumar's 
ease had not specifically addressed the issue whether the Tribunals under the Act would have the 
power to strike down statutory provisions or rules as being constitutionally invalid. However, the 
Division Bench in J.B. Chopras' case felt that this proposition would follow as a direct and logical 
consequence of the reasoning employed in Sampath Kumar's case. 
24. In M.B. Majumdar's case, a Division Bench of this Court had to confront the contention, based 
on the premise that in Sampath Kumar's req.- this Court had equated the Tribunals established 
under the Act with High Courts, that the Members of the Central Administrative Tribunals must be 
paid the same salaries as were payable to Judges of the High Court. The Court, after analysing the 
text of Article 323A of the Constitution, the provisions of the Act, and the decision in Sampath 
Kumar's ease, rejected the contention that the Tribunals were the equals of the High Courts in 
Indian Karma • MO neonlaarA0n Orordosan 1au1er

L. Chandra Kumar vs Union Of India And Others on 18 March, 1997 
respect of their service conditions. The Court clarified that in Sampath Kumar's case, the Tribunals 
under the Act had been equated with High Courts only to the extent that the former were to act as 
substitutes for the latter in adjudicating service matters; the Tribunals could not, therefore, seek 
parity for all other purposes. 
25. In Antalya Chandra's ease, a Division Bench of this Court had to consider the question whether a 
dispute before the central Administrative Tribunal could be decided by a single Administrative 
Member. The Court took note of Subsection (2) of Section 5 of the Act which, as we have seen, 
stipulates that a Bench of a Tribunal under the Act should ordinarily consist of a Judicial Member 
and an Administrative Member, as also the relevant observations in Sampath Kumar's case, to 
conclude that under the scheme of Act, all cases should be heard by a Bench of two Members. It 
appears that the attention of the Court was not drawn towards Sub-section (6) of Section 5 which, as 
we have noticed, enables a single Member of a Tribunal under the Act to hear and decide cases 
26. The same issue arose for consideration before another Bench of this Court in Dr. Mahabal Ram's 
ca. The Court took note of the decision in Amulya Chandra's case and, since the vires of 
Sub-section (6) of Section 5 of the Act was not under challenge, held that Sub-sections (2) and (6) of 
Section 5 are to be harmoniously construed in the following manner (supra at p. 404): 
..There is no doubt that what has been said in Sampath Kumar's case would require safeguarding the 
interest of litigants in the matter of disposal of their disputes in a judicious way. Where complex 
questions of law would be involved the dispute would require serious consideration and thorough 
examination. There would, however, be many cases before the Tribunal where very often no 
constitutional issues or even legal points would be involved..We are prepared to safeguard the 
interests of claimants who go before the Tribunal by Holding that while allocating work to the Single 
Member - whether Judicial or administrative in terms of Sub-section (6), the Chairman should 
keep in view the nature of the litigation and where questions of law and for interpretation of 
constitutional provisions are involved they should not be assigned to a Single Member. In fact, the 
proviso itself indicates Parliament's concern to safeguard the interest of claimants by casting an 
obligation on the Chairman and Members who hear the cases to refer to a regular bench of two 
members such cases which in their opinion require to be heard by a bench of two Members. We 
would like to add that it would be open to either party appealing before a Single Member to suggest 
to the Member hearing the matter that it should go to a bench of two Members. The Member should 
ordinarily allow (he matter to go to a bench of two Members when so requested. This would 
sufficiently protect the interests of the claimants and even of the administrative system whose 
litigation may be before the Single Member for disposal..The vires of Sub- section (6) has not been 
under challenge and, therefore, both the provisions in Section 5 have to be construed keeping the 
legislative intention in view. We are of the view that what we have indicated above brings out the 
true legislative intention and the prescription in Sub- section (2) and the exemption in Sub-section 
(6) are rationalised.

L Chandra Kumar vs Union 01 India And Others on 1B March.19n7 
set up by exercising the power conferred by Artide 3236. In his leading judgment, RaillanWarrly, J. 
analysed the relevant constitutional provisions, the Decisions in Sampath Kumar, J.B. Chopra and 
M.B. Mahandar to hold that the Tribunals created under Artides 323A and 32313 could not be held 
to be substitutes of High Courts for the purpose of exercisingjurisdiction under Articles 226 and 227 
of the Constitution. Having had the benefit of more than five years' experience of the working of 
these alternative institutional mechanisms, anguish was expressed over their ineffectiveness in 
exercising the high power of judicial review. It was recorded that their performance had left much to 
be desired. Thereafter, it was noted that the sole remedy provided, that of an appeal to this Court 
under Article 136 of the Constitution, had proved to be prohibitively costly while also being 
inconvenient on account of the distances involved. It was suggested that an expert body like the Law 
Commission of India should study the feasibility of providing an appeal to a Bench of two Judges of 
the concerned High Court from the orders of such Tribunals and also analyse the working of the 
Tribunals since their establishment, the possibility of inducting members of the Bar to man such 
Tribunals CAC. It was hoped that recommendations of such an expert body would be immediately 
adopted by the Government of India and remedial steps would be initiated to overcome the 
difficulties faced by the Tribunals, making them capable of dispensing effective, inexpensive and 
satisfactory justice. 
28. In a separate but concurring judgment, Ahmadi, Sias he then was) speaking for himself and 
Punchhi, J., endorsed the recommendations in the following words: 
..(the time is ripe for taking stock of the working of the various Tribunals set up in the country after 
the insertion of Articles 323A and 32313 in the Constitution. A sound justice delivery system is a sine 
qua non for the efficient governance of a country wedded to the rule of law. An independent and 
impartial justice delivery system in which the litigating public has faith and confidence alone can 
deliver the goods. After the incorporation of these two articles, Acts have been enacted whereunder 
tribunals have been constituted for dispensation ofjustice. Sufficient time has passed and 
experience gained in these last few years for taking stock of the situation with a view to chiding out if 
they have served the purpose and objectives for which they were constituted. Complaints have been 
heard in regard to the functioning of other tribunals as well and it is time that a body like the Law 
Commission of India has a comprehensive look-in with a view to suggesting measures for their 
improved functioning. That body can also suggest changes in the different statutes and evolve a 
model on the basis whereof tribunals may be constituted or reconstituted with a view to ensuring 
greeter independence. An intensive and extensive study needs to be undertaken by the Law 
Commission in regard to the Constitution of tribunals under various statutes with a view to ensuring 
their independence so that the public confidence in such tribunals may increase and the quality of 
their performance may improve. We strongly recommend to the Law Commission of India to 
undertake such an exercise on priority basis. A copy of this judgment may be forwarded by the 
Registrar of this Court to the Member Secretary of the Commission for immediate action. 
29. During the hearing, were requested the learned Additional Solicitor General of India, Mr. K.N. 
Bhat, to inform us of the measures undertaken to implement the directions issued by this Court in 
R.K. Jain's case. We  were told that the Law Commission had in fact initiated a performance-analysis 
on the lines suggested in the judgment; however, when the Division Bench issued its order 
Indian KalICOn - nee ed iankanoon.orgedoc.1152510/ 
10 
L. Chandra Kumar vs Union Or India And Others on IB March. 1997 
indicating that Sampath Kumar's ease might have to be reviewed by a larger Bench, further progress 
on the study was halted. 
30. We may now apply ourselves to analysing the decision which has been impugned in one of the 
matters before us, CA. No. 169 of 1994. The judgment, Saldnala Harinath and Ors. v. State of A.P., 
rendered by a full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, has declared Article 323A (2)(d) of the 
Constitution to be unconstitutional to the extent it empowers Parliament to exclude the jurisdiction 
of the High Courts under Article 226 of the Constitution; additionally, Section 28 of the Act has also 
been held to be unconstitutional to the extent it divests the High Courts ofjurisdiction under Article 
226 in relation to service matters. 
31. TheJudgment of the Court, delivered by M.N. Rao, J. has in a elaborate manner, viewed the 
central issues before us against the backdrop of several landmark decisions delivered by 
Constitution Benches of this Court as also the leading authorities in the comparative constitutional 
law. The judgment has embarked on a aide-ranging quest, extending to the American, Australian 
and British jurisdictions, to ascertain the true import of the concepts of judicial power', judicial 
review' and other related aspects. The judgment has also analysed a contention based on Article 
39ND of the Constitution, but since that aspect is not relevant to the main controversy before us, we 
shall avoid its discussion. 
32. The Judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court has, after analyzing various provisions of our 
Constitution, held that under our constitutional scheme the Supreme Court and the High Courts are 
the sole repositories ofthe power ofjudicial review. Such power, being inclusive of the power to 
pronounce upon the validity' of statutes, actions taken and orders passed by individuals and bodies 
falling within the ambit of the impression "State" in Article 12 of the Constitution, has only been 
entrusted to the constitutional courts, i.e., the High Courts and this Court. For this proposition, 
support has been drawn from the rulings of this Courtin Lesavananda Bharati v State of Kerala : 
AIRapv3SCI461 , Special Reference No.1 of 1964, [19657 i SCR 413; Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj 
Nandi); U97513SCR824a ; Minerva Mills lid v Union of India : ap817SCR2o6 , Kihoto Hollohan 
Zachillu and Ors. : N9921ISCR686 and certain other decisions, all of which have been extensively 
analysed and profusely quoted from. 
33. Analysing the decision in Sampath Kumar's case against this back-drop, it is noted that the 
theory of alternative institutional mechanisms established in Sampath Kumar's case is in defiance of 
the proposition laid down in Kesvananda Bharati's case, Special reference case and Indira Gandhi's 
case, that the Constitutional Courts alone are competent to exercise the power ofjudicial review to 
pronounce upon the constitutional validity of statutory provisions and rules. The High Court, 
therefore felt that the decision in Sampath Kumar's case, being per incuriam, was not binding upon 
it. The High Court also pointed out that, in any event, the issue of constitutionality of Article 323A 
(2) (d) was neither challenged nor upheld in Sampath Kumar's case and it could not be said to be an 
authority on that aspect. 
34. Thereafter, emphasising the importance of service matters which affect the functioning of civil 
servants, who are an integral part of a sound governmental system, the High Court held that service 
Indian Hanson NV eindienkaneen orgict aft1525/5/ 	
II 
6 
e. Chandra Kumar vs Union Of India And Others on IS Mares 1997 
matters which involve testing the constitutionality of provisions or rules, being matters of grave 
import, could not be left to be decided by statutorily created adjudicatory bodies, which would be 
susceptible to executive influences and pressures. It was emphasised that in respect of constitutional 
Courts, the Framers of our Constitution had incorporated special prescriptions to ensure that they 
would b Lam 	
fro p • ely such pressures_ The High Court also cited reasons for holding that 
the sole remedy provided, that of an appeal under Article 136 to this Court, was not capable of being 
a real safeguard. It was also pointed out that even the saving of Ole jurisdiction of this Court under 
Article 32 of the Constitution would not help improve matters. It was, therefore, concluded that 
although judicial power can be vested in a Court or Tribunal, the power ofjudicial review of the 
High Court under Article 226 could not be excluded even by a constitutional Amendment. 
Article 32313. 
32. This provision of the Constitution empowers Parliament or the State Legislatures, as the case 
may be, to enact laws providing for the adjudication or trial by Tribunals of disputes, complaints or 
offences with respect to a wide variety of matters which have been specified in the nine Sub-clause 
of Clause (2) of Article 3233. The matters specified cover a wide canvas including inter alia disputes 
relating to tax cases, foreign exchange matters, industrial and labour cases, ceiling on urban 
property, election to State Legislatures and Parliament, essential goods and their distribution, 
criminal offences etc. Clause (3) enables the concerned Legislature to provide for the establishment 
of a hierarchy of Tribunals and to lay down their jurisdiction, the procedure to be followed by them 
in their functioning, etc. Sub-clause (d) of Clause (3) empowers the concerned Legislature to exclude 
the jurisdiction of all courts, except the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 136 of thc 
Constitution, with respect to all or any of matters falling teithin the jurisdiction of the Tribunals. The 
constitutional provision, therefore, invests Parliament of the State Legislatures, as the case may be, 
with powers to divest the traditional courts of a considerable portion of their judicial work. 
36. According to the information provided to us by 61r, K.N. Bhat, the learned Additional Solicitor 
General, until the present date, only four Tribunals have been created under Article 3238 pursuant 
to legislations enacted by the Legislatures of three States. The first of these was the West Bengal 
Taxation Tribunal which was set up in 1689 under the West Bengal Taxation Tribunal Act, 1989. 
Similarly, the Rajasthan Taxation Tribunal was set up in 1995  under the Rajasthan Taxation 
Tribunal Act, 1996 The State of Tamil Nadu has set up two Tribunals by utilising the power 
conferred upon it by Article 3233.  The first of these was the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms Special 
Appellate Tribunal which was established on 1.11.1990 under the Tamil Nadu La d Reforms 
(Fixation of Ceiling of Land) Amendment Act, 1985 to deal with all matters relating to land reforms 
arising under the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling on Land) Act, 1961. Later, the 
Tamil Nadu Taxation Special Tribunal was established on 22.12.1995 under the Tamil Nadu 
Taxation Special Tribunal Act, 1992 to deal with cases arising under the Duni' Nadu General Sales 
Tax Act and Additional Sales Tax Act. 
37, Certain problems have arisen in the functioning of these Tribunals especially in respect of the 
manner in which they exclude the jurisdiction of their respective High Courts. This aspect can be 
illustrated by briefly adverting to the broad facts of two of the matters before us. CA No. 1532-33 of

1993 arises as a result of conflicting orders issued by the West Bengal Taxation Tribunal and the 
Calcutta High Court. Certain petitioners had challenged the constitutional validity of some 
provisions in three legislations enacted by the West Bengal Legislature before the west Bengal 
Taxation Tribunal. After examining the matter and hearing the arguments advanced in response by 
the State of West Bengal, the West Bengal Taxation Tribunal, by this order dated 9ti0.1991, upheld 
the constitutional validity of the impugned provisions. Thereafter, the constitutional validity of the 
same provisions was challenged in a Writ Petition before the Calcutta High Court. During the 
proceedings, the State of West Bengal raised the preliminary objection that by virtue of Section 14 of 
the West Bengal Taxation Tribunal Act, 1987, which excluded the jurisdiction of the High Court in 
all matters within the jurisdiction of the Taxation Tribunal, the Calcutta High Court had no 
jurisdiction to entertain the writ petition. However, the High Court proceeded with the case and, by 
its judgment dated 25.11.1692, declared the impugned provisions to be unconstitutional. These 
developments have resulted in an interesting situation, where the same provisions have alternately 
been held to be constitutional and unconstitutional by two different form, each of which considered 
itself to be empowered to exercise jurisdiction. 
38. S.L.P. No. 17768 of 1961 seeks to challenge a judgment of the Madras High Court which has held 
that the establishment of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms Special Appellate Tribunal will not affect 
the powers of the Madras High Court to issue writs. This decision is based on the reasoning that the 
Legislature of the State had no power" to infringe upon the High Courts' powers to issue writs under 
Article 226 of the Constitution and to exercise its powers of superintendence under Article 227 of 
the Constitution." 
39. It is against these circumstances that we must now test the propositions put forth for our 
consideration. 
Submissions of Counsel. 
4n. We have heard the submission of several learned senior counsel who appeared for the various 
parties before us. Mr. Rama This and Mr. Shanti Bhushan, through their respective arguments, 
urged us to review the decision in Sampath Kumar's case and to hold Article 323A (2)(d) and Article 
323 B (3)(d) of the Constitution to be unconstitutional to the extent they allow Tribunals created 
under the Act to exclusively exercise the jurisdiction vested in the High Courts under Articles 226 
and 227 of the Constitution. On the other hand, Mr. Bhat, the learned Additional Solicitor General, 
Mr. P.P. Rao, and Mr. K.K. Venugopal urged us to uphold the validity of the impugned 
constitutional provisions and to allow such Tribunals to exercise the jurisclietion under Article 226 
of the Constitution. We have also heard arguments advanced on behalf of the Registrar of the 
Principal Bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal, who was represented before us by Mr. Kapil 
Sibal. Mr. VS. Reddy, the learned Additional Solicitor General, urged us to set aside the judgment 
of the Madras High Court which affects the jurisdiction of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms Special 
Appellate Tribunal. Certain other counsel have also addressed us in support of the main arguments 
advanced.

L Cif andra Kumar vs Union Of India And Others on 18 March, 1907 
41. Mr. Rama Jois, learned Counsel for the petitioner in W.P. No. 918 of 1992, contended as follows: 
(i) Section 5(6) of the Act, insofar as it allows a single Member Bench of a Tribunal to test the 
constitutional validity of a statutory provision, is unconstitutional. This proposition flows from the 
decisions in Sampath Kumar's case, Antalya Chandra's case and Dr. Mahabal Ram's case. In 
Sampath Kumads case, this Court had required a Bench of a Tribunal to ordinarily consist of a 
Judicial Member and an Administrative Member. Consequently, Section 5 (2) of the Act was 
accordingly amended; however, since Section 5(6) was not amended simultaneously, the import of 
the observations in Sampath Kumar's case can still be frustrated. Even if the theory of alternative 
institutional mechanisms adopted in Sampath Kumar's case, is presumed to be correct, Section 5(6) 
of the Act will have robe struck down as a single Member Bench of a Tribunal cannot be considered 
to be a substitute for the exercise of the power of a High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution; 
(ii) The impugned provisions of the Constitution, insofar as they exclude the jurisdiction of the 
Supreme Court and the High Courts under Articles 32 and of the Constitution, are unconstitutional, 
This is for the reason that: (a) Parliament cannot, in exercise of its constituent power, confer power 
on Parliament and the State Legislatures to exclude the constitutional jurisdiction conferred on the 
High Courts as the power to amend the Constitution cannot be conferred on the Legislatures; and 
(b) These provisions violate the basic structure of the Constitution insofar as they take away the 
power of judicial review vested in the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution and the 
High Courts under Articles 226 and 227 the Constitution. While the Tribunals constituted under 
Articles 323A and 323 B can be vested with the power of judicial review over administrative action, 
the power ofjudicial review of legislative action cannot be conferred upon them. This proposition 
flows from Kesavananda Bharati's case where it was held that under our constitutional scheme, only 
the constitutional courts have been vested with the power of judicial review of legislative action; (iii) 
While the provisions of the Act do not purport to affect the sacrosanct jurisdiction of the Supreme 
Court under Article 32 of the Constitution, Articles 323A and 323B allow Parliament to pursue such 
a course in future and are therefore liable to be struck down; 
(iv) The decision in Smooth Kumar's case was founded on the hope that the Tribunals would be 
effective substitutes for the High Courts. This position is neither factually nor legally correct on 
account of the following differences between High Courts and these Tribunals: (a) High Courts enjoy 
vast powers as a consequence of their being Courts of record under Article 215 of the Constitution 
and also process the power to issue Certificates of Appeal under Articles 132 and 133 of the 
Constitution in cases where they feel that a decision of this Court is required. This is not so for 
Tribunals; (b) the qualifications for appointment of a High Court Judge and the constitutional 
safeguards provided ensure the independence of and efficiency of the Judges who man the High 
Courts. The conditions prescribed for Members of Tribunals are not comparable; (c) While the 
jurisdiction of the High Courts is constitutionally protected, a Tribunal can be abolished by simply 
repealing its parent statute; (d) While the expenditure of the High Courts is charged to the 
Consolidated Fund of the States, the Tribunals are dependent upon the appropriate Government for 
the grant of funds for meeting their expenses. These and other differences give rise to a situation 
whereby the Tribunals, being deprived of constitutional safeguards for ensuring their independence, 
arc incapable of being effective substitutes for the High Courts; (v) Under our constitutional scheme, 
every High Court has, by virtue of Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, the power to issue 
prerogative writs or orders to all authorities and instrumentalities of the State which function within 
Indian Kaman Otto indianaanoon ocoldool 152518)

its territorial jurisdiction. In such a situation, no authority or Tribunal located within the territorial 
jurisdiction of a High Court can disregard the law declared by it. The impugned constitutional 
provisions, insofar as they seek to divest the High Courts of their power of superintendence over all 
Tribunals and Courts situated within their territorial jurisdiction, violate the basic structure of the 
constitution, and (vi) In view of the afore-stated propositions, the decision in Sampath Kumar's case 
requires a comprehensive reconsideration. 
42. Mr. Shoal Bhushan, appearing for the respondent in C.A. No. g32-33/96, advanced the 
following submissions: (i) The 42nd Amendment to the Constitution, which introduced the 
impugned constitutional proaisions, must be viewed in its historical context. The 42nd Amendment, 
being motivated by a feeling of distrust towards the established judicial institutions, sought, in letter 
and spirit, to divest constitutional courts of their jurisdiction. The aim was to vest such 
constitutional jurisdiction in creatures whose establishment and functioning could be controlled by 
the executive. Such an intent is manifest in the plain words of Articles 323A and 3236 which oust 
the jurisdiction vested in this Court and the High Courts under Articles 32, 226 and 227 of the 
Constitution; (ii) The validity of the impugned provisions has to be determined irrespective of the 
manner in which the power conferred by them has been exercised. In Sampath Kumar's ease, this 
Court restricted its enquiry to the Act, which did not oust the jurisdiction under Article 32, and did 
not explore the larger issue of the constitutionality of Article 323A (2)(d), which in express terms 
permits Parliament to oust the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. This was not correct approach as 
the constitutionality of a provision ought not to be judged only against the manner in which power is 
sought to be exercised under it. The correct test is to square the provision against the constitutional 
scheme and then pronounce upon its compatibility. The vice in Article 323A (2)(d) is that it permits 
Parliament to enact, at a future date, a law to exclude the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32. 
Being possessed of such potential for unleashing constitutional mischief in the future, its vines 
cannot be sustained; (iii) The power ofjudicial review vested in this Court under Article 32 and the 
High Court under Article 226 is part of the basic structure of the Constitution. The relevant portions 
of the decisions in Kesavananda Bhararts ease, Fertiliser Corporation Kamgar Union v. Union of 
India : H981)ILIalio3SC and Delhi Judicial Service Association v. State of Gujarat : AIRroorSCmgo 
highlight the importance accorded to Article 32 of the Constitution; (iv) The theory of alternative 
institutional mechanisms advocated in Sampath Kumar's case ignores the fact that judicial review 
vested in the High Courts consists not only of the power conferred upon the High Courts but also of 
the High Courts themselves as institutions endowed with glorious judicial traditions. The High 
Courts had been in existence since the loth century and were possessed of a hoary past enabling 
them to win the confidence of the people. It is this which prompted the Framers of our Constitution 
to vest such constitutional jurisdiction in them. A Tribunal, being a new creation of the executive, 
would not be able to recreate a similar tradition and environment overnight. Consequently, the 
alternative mechanisms would not, in the absence of an atmosphere conducive to the building of 
traditions, be able to act as effective alternatives to High Courts for the exercise of constitutional 
Jurisdiction In Pratibha Bonnoriea v Union of India : AlRa996SC693 , this Court has analysed the 
special constitutional status of Judges of High Courts and explained how they are distinct from 
other tiers of the judiciary.

43. Mr. AK. Ganguli, appearing for the second and third respondents in CA.1532-33/93, adopted 
the arguments of Mr. Rama Jois and Mr. Bhushan. In addition, he cited certain authorities in 
support of his contention that the power to interpret the provisions of the Constitution is one which 
has been solely vested in the constitutional courts and cannot be bestowed on newly created 
quasi-judicial bodies which are susceptible to executive influences. 
44. Mr. K.N. Bhat, the learned Additional Solicitor General of India represented the Union of India 
which is a party in C.A. No. 169 of 1994 and CA. No. 481 of 1989. His contentions are as follows: (i) 
Clause a(d) of Article 323A and Clause 3(d) of Article 323B ought not to be struck down on the 
ground that they exclude the jurisdiction of this Court under:kr-dole 32 of the Constitution. On 
account of several decisions of this Court, it is a well-established proposition in law that the 
jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution is sacrosanct and is indisputably a part 
of the basic structure of the Constitution. This position had been clearly enunciated well before the 
42nd Amendment to He Constitution was conceived. Therefore, Parliament must be deemed to have 
been aware of such a position and it must be concluded that the jurisdiction under Article 32 was 
not intended to be affected. However, the jurisdiction of the High Courts under Article 226 was 
sought to be removed by creating alternative institutional mechanisms. The theory enunciated in 
Sampath Kumar's case is based on sound considerations and does not require any reconsideration; 
(ii) Alternatively, Articles 323A and 3233 do not seek to exclude the supervisoryjurisdiction of the 
High Courts over all Tribunals situated within their territorial jurisdiction. Viewed from this 
perspective, the High Courts would still he vested with Constitutional powers to exercise corrective 
or supervisory jurisdiction; (iii) Since the decisions of this Court in Amulya Chandra's case and Dr. 
Mahabal Ram's case had clearly held that matters relating to the vires of a provision arc to be dealt 
with by a Bench consisting of a judicial member and these guidelines will be followed in future, 
there is no vice of unconstitutionality in Section 5 (6). 
45. Mr. HP. Rao, learned Counsel for the State of Andhra Pradesh in CA. No. 196 of 1994 and the 
connected special leave petitions, put forth the following submissions: (i) The matter before us 
involves a very serious, live problem which needs to be decided by adopting a pragmatic, cooperative 
approach instead of by a dogmatic, adversarial process. It is a fact that the Administrative Tribunals 
which were conceived as substitutes for the High Courts have not lived upto expectations and have 
instead, proved to be inadequate and ineffective in several ways. However, the striking down of the 
impugned constitutional provisions would, instead of remedying the problem, contribute to its 
worsening. The problem of pendency in High Courts which has been a cause for concern for several 
decades, has been focused upon by several expert committees and commissions. The problem of 
enormous increase in the volume of fresh institution coupled with massive areas has necessitated 
the sacking of realistic solutions in order to prevent High Courts from becoming incapable of 
discharging their functions. The consistent view of thaw expert committees has been that the only 
manner in which the situation can be saved is by transferring some of the jurisdiction of the High 
Courts, in relatively less important areas, to specially constituted Tribunals which would act as 
substitutes for the High Courts. In Sampath Kumar's case, this Court was required to test the 
constitutional validity of providing for such a substitute to the High Court in the shape of 
Administrative Tribunals. While deciding the case, this Court had actually monitored the 
amendments to the Act by a series of orders and directions given from time to time as the learned 
Indian Kennon hitp7hickankani0Onarg/639115251911

L. Chandra Kumar vs Union Of India And Others on 18 Maven. 1997 
Attorney General had offered to effect the necessary amendments to the Act to remove its defects. 
After the necessary amendments were made to the Act, this Court was satisfied that there was no 
need to strike, it down as it was of the view that the Act would provide an effective alternative forum 
to the High Courts for the resolution of service disputes. However, the actual functioning of the 
Tribunals during the last decade has brought forth several deficiencies which need to be removed. 
The remedy, however, lies not in striking down the constitutional provisions involved but in 
allowing the Union of India to further amend the Act so as to ensure that the Tribunals become 
effective alternative form; (ii) Article 323A (2)(d) does not violate the basic structure of the 
Constitution. The relevant observations m Keshvananda Bharati's case, show that there is an 
inherent distinction between the individual provisions of the Constitution and the basic features of 
the Constitution. while the basic features of the Constitution cannot be changed even by amending 
the Constitution each and every provision of the Constitution can be amended under Article 363. 
The majority judgments in Keshavananda Bhard's case emphatically state that the concept of 
separation of powers is a basic feature of the Constitution, It, therefore, follows that the powers of 
judicial review, which is a necessary concomitant of the independence of the judiciary, is also a basic 
feature of our Constitution. However, it does not follow that specific provisions such as Article 32 or 
Article 226 are by themselves part of the basic structure of the Constitution. In this regard, the 
history of Article 31, which contained a Fundamental Right to Property and was shifted from Part III 
to Chapter IV of Part XII can be cited by way of an example; (iii) the essence of the power ofjudicial 
review is that it must always remain with the judiciary and must not be surrendered to the executive 
or the legislature. Since the impugned provisions save the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 
136, thereby allowing the judiciary to have the final say in every form of adjudication, it cannot be 
said that the basic feature of judicial review had been violated. The constitutional bar is against the 
conferment of judicial power on agencies outside the judiciary. However, if within the judicial 
set-up, arrangements are made in the interests of bolter administration ofjustice to limit the 
jurisdiction under Article 32 and 226 of the Constitution, there can be no grievance. In fact, it is in 
the interest of better administration ofjustice that this Court has developed a practice, even in the 
case of violation of Fundamental Rights, of requiring parties to approach the concerned High Court 
under Article 226 instead of directly approaching this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution. 
This, undoubtedly, has the effect of limiting the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 but, being 
necessary for proper administration ofjustice, cannot be challenged as unconstitutional. Service 
matters, which are essentially in the nature of in-house disputes, being of lesser significance than 
those involving Fundamental Rights, can also be transferred to Tribunals on the same reasoning; 
(iv) By virtue of Order XXVII-A, Rule IA, ordinary civil courts are empowered to adjudicate upon 
questions of sires of statutory rules and instruments. In view of this situation, there is no 
constitutional difficulty in empowering Tribunals to have similar powers; (v) Alternatively, in ease 
we are inclined to take view that the power of judicial review of legislative enactments cannot in any 
event be conferred on any other Court or Tribunal, we may use the doctrine of reading down to save 
the impugned constitutional provisions. So construed, the High Courts would continue to have 
jurisdiction to decide the sires of an Act even in the area of service disputes and would, therefore, 
perform a supervisory role over Tribunals in respect of matters involving constitutional questions. 
46. Mr. K.K. Venugopal, representing the State of West Bengal in S.L.P. No.1063 of 1996 and C.A. 
No.1532-33 of 1993, began by reiterating the contention that the impugned provisions do not seek

—got 
L. Chandra Ku mai 8S Union 011ndia And Others on 18 March.1887 
to oust the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 which is a basic feature of the Constitution. His 
alternative contention was that since the provisions do not exclude the jurisdiction under Ardcle 136 
and since Article 32 (3) itself conceives of the delegation of Mat jurisdiction, the ouster of the 
jurisdiction under Article 32 was not unconstitutional. This submission was based on the reasoning 
that, in the absence of any specific constitutional prohibition, both Parliament and the State 
legislatures were vested with sufficient legislation powers to effect changes in the original 
jurisdiction of this Court as well as the High Courts. He then stated that in the event that we are not 
inclined to hold in accordance with either of the earlier contentions, the doctrine of severability 
should he applied to excise the words "under Article 136" from the provisions and thus save them 
from the vice of unconstitutionality. Thereafter, he endeavoured to impress upon us the 
jurisprudential soundness of the theory of alternative institutional mechanism propounded in 
Sampath Komar's case. He then contended that the shortfalls in the Constitution of the Tribunals, 
the selection of their personnel, the methods of their appointment etc. are a consequence of 
legislative and executive errors of judgment; these shortfalls cannot affect the constitutionality of 
the parent constitutional provisions. He concluded by declaring that these constitutional 
amendments were lawfully incorporated by the representatives of the people in exercise ofthe 
constituent power of Parliament to remedy the existing problem of inefficacious delivery ofjustice in 
the High Courts. He counseled us not to substitute our decision for that of the policy evolved by 
Parliament in exercise of its constituent power and urged us to suggest suitable amendments, as was 
done in Sampath Kumars case, to make up for the shortfalls in the e,dsting system. 
47. Mr. Khan IL Shall, the petitioner in W.P. No. 789 of 1990, who is a lawyer practicing before the 
Ahmedabad Bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal, sought to apprise us of the practical 
problems faced by advocates in presenting their cases before the Central Administrative Tribunal 
and of several complaints regarding the discharge of their official duties. 
48. The Registrar of the Principle Bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal, who is the Second 
respondent in Cel No. 481 of 1989, was represented before us by Mr. Kapil Sibs). The case of the 
Registrar is that the Tribunals, as they are functioning at present, arc not effective substitutes for the 
High Courts. However, the creation of alternative institutional mechanisms is not violative of the 
basic structure so long as it is as efficacious as the constitutional courts. He urged us to discontinue 
the appointment of Administrative Members to the Tribunals and to ensure that the Members of the 
Tribunals have security of tenure, which is a necessary pre-requisite for securing their 
independence. 
49. Mr. V.R. Reddy, the learned Additional Solicitor General of India, drew our attention towards 
the judgment of the Madras High Court which is the subject of challenge in S.L.P. No.17768 of 1991. 
Mr. Reddy endeavoured to convince us that the amendments incorporated in the legislation which 
created the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms Special Appellate Tribunal after the decision in Sampath 
Rum £1185 case have the effect of making it a proper and effective substitute for the High Courts. He 
also submitted that the functioning of the Land Reforms Tribunal was essential for the effective 
resolution of disputes in that branch of law.

so. We may now address the main issues which have been identified at the beginning of this 
judgment as being central to the adjudication of this batch of matters. This would involve an 
appreciation of the power ofjudicial review and an understanding of the manner and the 
instrumentalities through which it is to be exercised. 
sr The underlying theme of the impugned judgment of the A.P. High Court rendered by M.N. Rao, 
J. is that the power of judicial review is one of the basic features of our Constitution and that aspect 
of the power which enables courts to test the constitutional validity of statutory provisions is vested 
exclusively in the constitutional courts, i.e., the High Courts and the Supreme Courts. In this 
Regard, the position in American Constitutional Law in respect of Courts created under Article III of 
the Constitution of the United States has been analysed to state that the functions of Article III 
Courts (constitutional courts) cannot be performed by other legislative courts established by the 
Congress in exercise of its legislative power. The following decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court have 
been cited for support : National Mugal Insurance Co. of the District of Columbia v. Tidewater 
Transfer Co. 93 L. Ed. A56 337 US 582, Thomas S. William v. United States 77 L. Ed. 1372 289 US 
553, Cooper v. Aaron 3 L. Ed. ed5358 US r, Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon 
Pipeline Co. and United States 73 L. Ed. vd 59 458  US 5o. 
52. We may briefly advert to the position in American Constitutional Law to the extent that it is 
relevant for our purpose. As pointed out by Henery J. Abraham, an acclaimed. American 
Constitutional Law scholar, judicial review in the United States comprises the power of any court to 
hold unconstitutional and hence unenforceable any law, any official action based upon a law or any 
other action by a public official that it deems to be in conflict with the Basic Law, in the United 
States, its Constitution. It further stated that in the United States, the highly significant power of 
judicial review is possessed, theoretically, by every court of record, no matter how high or low on the 
judicial ladder. Though it occurs only infrequently, it is quite possible for a Judge in a low-level 
court of one of the 5o States to declare a Federal Law unconstitutional. 
53. The position can be better appreciated by analysing the text of Section r of Article Ill of the US. 
Constitution: 
Article III, Section - TheJudicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court, 
and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, 
both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good behavior, and shall, at 
stated times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not he diminished during their 
Continuance in Office. 
(Emphasis added) 
54. The judgment of the A.P. High Court is, therefore, correct in asserting that the judicial power 
vested in Article III of the U.S. Constitution can only be exercised by courts created under Section 
of Article III. However, what must be emphasised is the fact that Article III itself contemplates the 
conferment of such judicial power by the U.S. Congress upon inferior courts so long as the 
independence of the Judges is ensured in terms of Section t to Article III. The proposition which 
Inman Kanoon httpdeindiankanOOn orgicioc,119251a 	
15 
- 
L Chandra KLnar vs Union Of India AnCOlhers on 18 March, 1997 
emerges from this analysis is that in the United States, though the concept of judicial power has 
been accorded great constitutional protection, there is no blanket prohibition on the conferment of 
judicial power upon courts other than the U.S. Supreme Court. 
55. Henry J. Abraham's definition of judicial review in the American context is, subject to a few 
modifications, equally applicable to concept as it is understood in Indian Constitutional Law. 
Broadly speaking, judicial review in India comprises three aspects: judicial review of legisladve 
action, judicial review of judicial decisions and judicial review of administrative action. We are, for 
the present, concerned only with understanding the first two aspects. 
56. In the modern era, the origin of the power of judicial review of legislative action may well be 
traced to the classic enunciation of the principle by Chief, Justice John Marshall of the U.S Supreme 
Court in Marbury v. Mad' Cr 137 (18038: 
It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. Those who 
apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound and interpret that rule.A law 
repugnant to the Constitution is void.. Courts as well as other departments are bound by that 
instrument. 
(Emphasis added) The assumption of such a power unto itself by the U.S. Supreme Court was never 
seriously challenged and, over the years, it has exercised this power in numerous cases despite the 
persisting criticism that such an exercise was undemocratic. Indeed, when the Framers of our 
Constitution set about their monumental task, they were well aware that the principle that courts 
possess the power to invalidate duly enacted legislations had already acquired a history of nearly a 
century and a half. 
dy. At a very early stage of the history of this Court, when it was doubted whether it was justified in 
exercising such a power, Patanjali Sastri, C.1, While emphatically laying down the foundation of the 
principle held as follows State of Madras v V G. Roll: 1952Cu1.1966 : 
..[O]ur Constitution contains express provisions for judicial review of legislation as to its conformity 
with the Constitution, unlike as in America where the Supreme Court has assumed extensive powers 
of soliciting legislative acts under cover of the widely interpreted "due process" clause in the Fifth 
and Fourteenth Amendments. If, then, the courts, in this country face up to such important and 
none too easy task, it is not out of any desire to tilt at legislative authority in a crusader's sprit, but in 
discharge of a duty plainly laid upon them by the constitution. This is especially lame as regards the 
"fundamental rights", as to which this Courts has been assigned the role of a sentinel on the qui vive. 
While the Court naturally attaches great weight to the legislative judgment, it cannot desert its own 
duty to determine finally the constitutionality of an impugned statute. 
(Emphasis added) 
58. Over the years, this Court has had many an opportunity to express its views on the power of 
judicial review of legislative action. What follows is an analysis of the leading pronouncements on 
Indian Kanoon

the issue. 
59. While delivering a separate but concurring judgment in the Eve-Judge Constitution Bench 
Decision in Bidi Supply Co. v, The Union of India and Ors-: [1956129ITRTINSC) , Bose, J. made the 
following observations which are apposite to the Present context: 
The heart and core of democracy has in the judicial process, and that means independent and 
fearless judges free from executive control brought up in judicial traditions and training to judicial 
ways of working and thinking. The main bulwarks of liberty of freedom lie there and it is clear to me 
that uncontrolled powers of discrimination in matters that seriously affect the lives and properties of 
people cannot be left to executive or quasi executive bodies even if they exercise quasi judicial 
functions because they are then invested with an authority that even Parliament does not possess. 
Under the Constitution, Acts, of Parliament are subjected to judicial review particularly when they 
are said to infringe fundamental rights, therefore, if under the Constitution Parliament itself has not 
uncontrolled freedom, of action, it is evident that it cannot invest lesser authorities with that power. 
60. Special Reference No. r of 064, was a case where a seven-Judge Constitution Bench of this 
Court had to express itself on the thorny issue of Parliamentary privileges. While doing so, the Court 
was required to consider the manner in which our Constitution has envisaged a balance of power 
between the three wings of Government and it was in this context that Gajendragadkar, CJ made the 
following observations: 
..[Wjhether or not there is distinct and rigid separation of powers under the Indian Constitution, 
there is no doubt that the Constitution has entrusted to the Judicature in this country the task of 
construing the provisions of the Constitution and of safeguarding the fundamental rights of the 
citizens. When a statute is challenged on the ground that it has been passed by a Legislature without 
authority, or has otherwise unconstitutionally trespassed on fundamental rights, it is for the courts 
to determine the dispute and decide whether the law passed by the legislature is valid or not Just as 
the legislatures are conferred legislative functions, and the functions and authority of the executive 
lie within the domain of executive authority, so the jurisdiction and authority of the Judicature in 
this country lie within the domain of adjudication. lithe validity of any law is challenged before the 
courts, it is never suggested that the material question as to whether legislative authority has been 
exceeded or fundamental rights have been contravened, can be decided by the legislatures 
themselves. Adjudication of such a dispute is entrusted solely and exclusively to the Judicature of 
this country. 
(Emphasis added) 
61. It is interesting to note that the origins of the power ofjudicial review of legislative action have 
not been attributed to one source alone. While Sastri, C.J. found the power mentioned expressly in 
the text of the Constitution, Gajendragadkar, CS. preferred to trace it to the manner in which the 
Constitution has separated powers between the three wings of Government.

62. In Kesvananda MlaraCS Case, a 13 - Judge Constitution Bench, by a majority of 7:6, held that 
though, by virtue of Article 368, Parliament is empowered to amend to Constipation, that power 
cannot be exercised so as to damage the basic features of the Constitution or to destroy its basic 
structure. The identification of the features which constitute the basic structure of our Constitution 
has been the subject-matter of great debate in Indian Constitutional Law. The difficulty is 
compounded by the fact that even the judgments for the majority are not unanimously agreed on 
this aspect. [There were five judgments for the majority, delivered by Sikri, CS., Shelat & Grover, JJ. 
Hegde &Mukherjadi JJ. Jaganmohan Reddy, J. and Khanna, J. While Khanna, J. did not attempt to 
catalogue the basic features, the identification of the basic features by the other Judges are specified 
in the following paragraphs of the Court's judgments Sikri, 	
(para 292), Shelat and Grover, JJ. 
(para 582), Hegde and NIultheljee, JJ. (pares 632, 661) and Jagatamohan Reddy, J. (pares 1159, 
1161)]. The aspect ofjudicial review does not find elaborate mention in all the majority judgments. 
Khanna, J. did, however, squarely address the issue rat pare1520: 
..The power of judicial review is, however, confined not merely to deciding whether in making the 
impugned laws the Central or State Legislatures have acted within the four corners of the legislative 
lists earmarked for them; the courts also deal with the question as to whether the laws are made in 
conformity with and not in violation of the other provisions of the Constitution..As long as some 
fundamental rights exist and are a part of the Constitution, the power ofjudicial renew has also to 
be exercised with a view to see that the guarantees afforded by those rights are not contravened.. 
Judicial review has thus become an integral part of our constitutional system and a power has been 
vested in the High Courts and the Supreme Court to decide about the constitutional validity of 
provisions of statutes. If the provisions of the statute are found to be violative of any article of the 
Constitution, which is touchstone for the validity of all laws, the Supreme Court and the High Courts 
are empowered to strike down the said provisions. 
(Emphasis added) 
69. Shelat & Grover, 	
while reaching the same conclusion in respect of Articles 32& 226, 
however, adopted a different approach to the issue (at pan 577): 
There is ample evidence in the Constitution itself to indicate that it creates a system of checks and 
balances by reason of which powers are so distributed that none of the three organs it sets up can 
become so pre- dominant as to disable the others from exercising and discharging powers and 
functions entrusted to them. Though the Constitution does not lay down the principle of separation 
of powers in all its rigidity as is the case in the United States Constitution but it envisages such a 
separation to a degree as was found in Ranasinghe's case (supra). The judicial review provided 
expressly in our Constitution by means of Articles 226 and 32 is one of the features upon which 
hinges the system of checks and balances. 
(Emphasis added)

Supreme Court, in election matters. Consequently, the Court was required to express its opinion on 
the concept ofjudicial review. Though all five Judges delivered concurring judgments to strike down 
the offending provision, their views on the issue ofjudicial review are replete with variations. Ray, 
CT., was of the view that the concept of judicial review, while a distinctive feature of American 
Constitutional Law, is not founded on any specific Article in our Constitution. He observed that 
judicial review can and has been excluded in several matters; in election matters, judicial review is 
not a compulsion. He, however, held that our Constitution recognises a division of the three main 
functions of Govermnent and that judicial power, which is vested in the judiciary cannot be passed 
to or shared by the Executive or the Legislature. (Paras 32, 43, 46, 52). Khanna, J. took the view that 
it is not necessary, within a democratic set up, (hat disputes relating to the validity of elections be 
settled by Courts of Law; he, however, felt that even so the legislature could not be permitted to 
declare that the validity of a particular election would act be challenged before any forum and would 
be valid despite the existence of disputes. (Para 207). Mathew, J. held that whereas in the United 
States of America and in Australia, the judicial power is vested exclusively in Courts, there is no such 
exclusive vesting ofjudicial power in the Supreme Court of India and the Courts subordinate to it. 
Therefore, the Parliament could, by passing a law within its competence, vest judicial power in any 
authority for deciding a dispute. (Paras 322 and 323). Beg, J. held that the power of Courts to test 
the legality of ordinary laws and constitutional amendments against the norms laid down in the 
Constitution flows from the 'supremacy of the Constitution' which is a basic feature of the 
Constitution. (Para 622). Chandrachud, J. felt that the contention that judicial review is a part of the 
basic structure and that any attempt to exclude the jurisdiction of courts in respect of election 
matters was unconstitutional, was too broadly stated. He pointed out that the Constitution, as 
originally enacted, expressly excluded judicial review in a large number of important: matters. The 
examples of Articles 136(2) and 226(4) [exclusion of review in laws relating to armed forces], Article 
262(2) [exclusion of review in river disputes] Article 103(1) [exclusion of review in disqualification 
of Members of Parliament], Article 329(a) [exclusion of review in laws relating to delimitation of 
constituencies and related matters], were cited for support. Based on this analysis, Chandrachud, 3. 
came to the conclusion that since the Constitution, as originally enacted, did not consider that 
judicial power must intervene in the interests of purity of elections, judicial review cannot be 
considered to be a part of the basic structure in so far as legislative elections are concerned. 
65. The foregoing analysis reveals that the Judges in Indira Gandhi's case, all of whom had been 
party to Kesavananda Bharati's case, did not adopt similar approaches to the concept ofjudicial 
review. While Beg, J. clearly expressed his view that judicial review was a part of the basic structure 
of the Constitution, Ray, CJ and Mathew, J. pointed out that unlike in the American context, judicial 
power had not been expressly vested in the judiciary by the Constitution of India. Khanna, J. did not 
express himself on this aspect, but in view of his emphatic observations in Kesavananda Bharati's 
case, his views on the subject can be understood tn have been made clear. Chandrachud, J. pointed 
out that the Constitution itself excludes judicial review in a number of matters and felt that in 
election matters, judicial review is not a necessary requirement.

the validity of certain provisions of the Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act, 1976 which inter alia,

L Chandra Humor vs Union Of Irmo And Others on 18 March, 1997 
Judges. contained the following observations(at p. 644, pan 21): 
..Our Constitution is founded on a nice balance of power among the three wings of the State, 
namely, the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary. It is the function of the Judges, nay their 
duty, to pronounce upon the validity of laws. If courts are totally deprived of that power, the 
fundamental rights conferred upon the people will become a mere adornment because rights 
without remedies are as writ in water. A controlled Constitution will then become uncontrolled. 
(Emphasis supplied) 
67. The majority judgment held the impugned provisions to be unconstitutional. While giving 
reasons in support, Chandrachud, Cl stated as follows: 
It is for the courts to decide whether restrictions are reasonable and whether they are in the 
interest of the particular subject. Apart from other basic dissimilarities, Article 31-C takes away the 
power of judicial review to an extent which destroys even the semblance of a comparison between its 
provisions and those of Clauses (2) to (6) of Article 19. Human ingenuity, limitless though it may be, 
has yet not devised a system by which the liberty of the people can be protected except through the 
intervention of courts of law. 
68.I1 may, however, be noted that the majority in Minerva Mills did not hold that the concept of 
judicial review was, by itself, part of the basic structure of the Constitution. The judgment of 
Chandrachud, CT in the Minerva Mill's case must be viewed in the context of his judgment in Indira 
Gandhi's case where he had stated that the Constitution, as originally enacted, excluded judicial 
review in several important matters. 
6E. In his minorityjudgment in Minerva Mills case, Bhagivan, J. held as follows: 
..The Constitution has, therefore, created an independent machinery for resolving these disputes 
and this independent machinery is the judiciary which is vested with the power ofjudicial review to 
determine the legality of executive action and the validity of legislation passed by Tie legislature. It 
is the solemn duty of the judiciary under the Constitution to keep the different organs of the State 
such as the executive and the legislature within the limits of the power conferred upon them by the 
Constitution. This power of judicial review is conferred on the judiciary by Articles 32 and 226 of the 
Constitution..The judiciary is the interpreter of the Constitution and to the judiciary is assigned the 
delicate task to determine what is the power conferred on each branch of government, whether it is 
limited, and if so, what are the limits and whether any action of that branch transgresses such limits. 
It is for the judiciary to uphold the constitutional values and to enforce the constitutional 
limitations. That is the essence of the rule of law, which inter alia requires that 	
exercise of 
powers by the government whether it be the legislature or the executive or any other authority, be 
conditioned by the Constitution and the law". The power of judicial review is an integral part of our 
constitutional system the power of judicial reviewais unquestionably-part of the basic structure of 
the Constitution. Of course, when I say this I should not be taken to suggest that effective alternative 
institutional mechanisms or arrangements for judicial review cannot be made by Parliament.

(Emphasis added) 
7o. The A.P. High Court has, through the judgment of M.N. Rao, 3., pointed out that the theory of 
alternative institutional mechanisms enunciated by Bhagwati, 3. in his minority judgment in 
Minerva Mill's case was not supported by or even mentioned in the majority judgment. In fact, such 
a theory finds no prior mention in the earlier decisions of this Court and, in the opinion of the AY. 
High Court, did not represent the correct legal position. It is to be noted that in Sampath Kumar's 
case, both Bhagwati, CS and Misra, S. in their separate judgment have relied on the observations in 
the minority judgment of Bhagwati, J. in Minerva Mill's case to lay the foundation of the theory of 
alternative institutional mechanisms. 
71. We may, at this stage, taloa note of the decision in Fertiliser Corporation Kamgar Union v. Union 
of India : (1981)ILL1w3SC , where Chandrachud, CI appears to have somewhat revised the view 
adopted by him in Indira Gandhi's case. In that case, speaking for the majority, Chandrachud, CS 
held that "the jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court by Article 32 is an important and integral 
part of the basic structure of the Constitution." (atpara 11). 
72. In Kihoto Hollohan v. Zachillu and Ors., a five-Judge Constitution Bench had to, inter alia, 
consider the validity of Paragraph 7 of the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution which excluded 
judicial review. The judgment for the minority, delivered by Verma, S. struck down the provision on 
the ground that it violated the rule of law which is a basic feature of the Constitution requiring that 
decisions be subject to judicial review by an independent outside authority. (Rams 181-182). Though 
the majority judgment delivered by Venkatachaliali J. also struck down the offending provision, the 
reasoning employed was different. The judgment for the majority contains an observation to the 
effect that in the opinion of the judges in the majority, it was not necessary for them to express 
themselves on the question whether judicial review is part of the basic structure of the Constitution. 
(Para too). 
73. We may now analyse certain other authorities for the proposition that the jurisdiction conferred 
upon the High Courts and the Supreme-Court under Article 226 and 32 of the Constitution 
respectively, is part of' the basic structure of the Constitution. While expressing his views on the 
significance of draft Article 25, which corresponds to the present Article 32 of the Constitution, Dr. 
Ambedkar, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constituent Assembly stated as 
follows (CAD, Vol. WI, T. 
953): 
If I was asked to name any particular Article in this Constitution as the most important - an Article 
without which this Constitution would be a nullity--I could not refer to any other Article except this 
one. It is the very soul of the Constitution and the very heart of it and I am glad th t the House has 
realised its importance.

74. This statement of Dr. Ambedkar has been specifically reiterated in several judgments of this 
Court to emphasise the unique significance attributed to Article 32 in our constitutional scheme. 
(See for instance, Khanna, J. in Kesavananda Bharatik case (p. 318), Bhagwali, J. in Minerva Mills 
(p. 678), Chandrachud, CJ Fertiliser Kamgar (pars u), R. Misra, J. in Sampath Kumar (p.137)1. 
75. In the Special Reference Case, While addressing this issue, Gajendragadhkar, CJ stated as 
follows (supra at PP. 493-  494): 
If the power of the Nigh Courts under Article 226 and the authority of this Court under Article 32 
are not subject to any exceptions, then it would be futile to contend that a citizen cannot move the 
High Courts or this Court to invoke their jurisdiction even in cases where his fundamental rights 
have been violated. The existence ofjudicial power in that behalf must necessarily and inevitably 
postulate the existence of a right in the citizen to move the Court in that behalf; otherwise the power 
conferred OD the High Courts and this Court would be rendered virtually meaningless. Let it not be 
forgotten that the judicial power conferred on the High Courts and this Court is meant for the 
protection of the citizens' fundamental rights, and so, in the existence of the said judicial power 
itself is necessarily involved the right of the citizen to appeal to the said power in a proper case. 
(Emphasis added) 
76. To express our opinion on the issue whether the power of judicial review vested in the High 
Courts and into the Supreme Court under Articles 226/227 and 32 is part of the basic structure of 
the Constitution, we must first attempt to understand what constitutes the basic structure of the 
Constitution. The Doctrine of basic structure was evolved in Kesvananda Bharafi's case. However, as 
already mentioned, that case did not lay down that the specific and particular features mentioned in 
that judgment alone would constitute the basic structure of our Constitution. Indeed, in the 
judgments of Shelat Ft Grover, JJ., Hegde & Multherjee, JJ. and Jaganmohan Reddy, J., there are 
specific observations to the effect that their list of essential features comprising the basic structure 
of the Constitution are illustrative and are not intended to be exhaustive. In Indira Gandhi's case, 
Chandrachud, J. held that the proper approach for a Judge who is confronted with the question 
whether a particular facet of the Constitution is part of the basic structure, is to examine, in each 
individual case, the place of the particular feature in the scheme of our Constitution, its object and 
purpose, and the consequences of its denial on the integrity of our Constitution as a fundamental 
instrument for the governance of the country, (supra at pp. 751-752). This approach was specifically 
adopted by Shag-watt. J. in Minerva Mill's case (supra at pp. 671-672) and is not regarded as the 
definitive test in this field of Constitutional Law. 
77. We find that the various factors mentioned in the test evolved by Chandrachud, J. have already 
been considered by decisions of various Benches of this Court that have been referred to in the 
course of our analysis. From their conclusions, many of which have been extracted by us in toto, it 
appears that this Court has always considered the power of judicial review vested in the High Courts 
and in this Court under Articles 226 and 32 respectively, enabling legislative action to be subjected 
to the scrutiny of superior courts, to be integral to our constitutional scheme. liThile several 
judgments have made specific references to this aspect iGajendragadlikar, Cl in Special Reference

Minerva Mills, Chandrachud, CJ in Fertiliser Kamgar, K.N. Singh, J. in Delhi Judicial Service 
Association, etc.] the rest have made general observations highlighting the significance of this 
feature. 
78. The legitimacy of the power of Courts within constitutional democracies to review legislative 
action has been questioned since the time it was first conceived. The Constitution of India, being 
alive to such criticism has while conferring such power upon the higher judiciary, incorporated 
important safeguards. An analysis of the manner in which the Framers of our Constitution 
incorporated provisions relating to the judiciary would indicate that they were very greatly 
concerned with securing the independence of the judiciary. These attempts were directed at 
ensuring that the judiciary would be capable of effectively discharging its wide powers ofjudicial 
review. While the Constitution confers the power to strike diem laws upon the High Courts and the 
Supreme Court, it also contains elaborate provisions dealing with the tenure, salaries, allowances, 
retirement age of Judges as well as the mechanism for selecting Judges to the superior courts. The 
inclusion of such elaborate provisions appears to have been occasioned by the belief that, armed by 
such provisions, the superior courts would be insulated from any executive or legislative attempts to 
interfere with the making of their decisions. The Judges of the superior courts have been entrusted 
with the task of upholding the Constitution and to this end, have been conferred the power to 
interpret it It is they who have to ensure that the balance of power envisaged by the Constitution is 
maintained and that the legislature and the executive do not, in the discharge of their functions, 
transgress constitutional limitations. It is equally their duty to oversee that the judicial decisions 
rendered by those who man the subordinate courts and tribunals do not fall foul of strict standards 
of legal correctness and judicial independence. The constitutional safeguards which ensure the 
independence of the Judges of the superior judiciary, are not available to the Judges of the 
subordinate judiciary or to those who man Tribunals created by ordinary legislations. Consequently, 
Judges of the latter category can never be considered full and effective substitutes for the superior 
judiciary in discharging the function of constitutional interpretation. We, therefore, hold that the 
power of judicial review over legislative action vested in the High Courts under Articles 226 and in 
this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution is an integral and essential feature of the 
Constitution, constituting part of its basic structure. Ordinarily, therefore, the power of High Courts 
and the Supreme Court to test the constitutional validity of legislations can never be ousted or 
excluded. 
79. We also hold that the power vested in the High Courts to exercise judicial superintendence over 
the decisions of all Courts and Tribunals within their respective jurisdictions is also part of the basic 
structure of the Constitution. This is because a situation where the High Courts are divested of all 
other judicial functions apart from that of constitutional interpretation, is equally to be avoided. 
So. However, it is important to emphasise that though the subordinate judiciary or Tribunals 
created under ordinary legislations cannot exercise the power ofjudicial review of legislative action 
to the exclusion of the High Courts and the Supreme Court, there is no constitutional prohibition 
against their performing a supplemental—as opposed to a substitution-role in this respect. That 
such a situation is contemplated within the constitutional scheme becomes evident when one

analyses Clause (3) of Article 32 of the Constitution which reads as under: 
32. Remedies for enforcement of rights conferred by this Part.--(1).. 
(3) Without prejudice to the powers conferred on the Supreme Court by Clauses (1) and (2), 
Parliament may by law empower ally other court to exercise within the local limits of its jurisdiction 
all or any of the powers exercisable by the Supreme Court under Clause (2). 
(Emphasis supplied) 
81.1f the power under.  rticle 32 of the Constitution, which has been described as th "heart" and 
"sour of the Constitution, can be additionally conferred upon "any other court", there is no reason 
why the same situation cannot subsist in respect of the jurisdiction conferred upon the High Courts 
under Article 226 of the Constitution. So long as the jurisdiction of the High Courts under Articles 
226/227 and that of this Court under Article 32 is retained, there is no reason why the power to test 
the validity of legislations against the provisions of the Constitution cannot he conferred upon 
Administrative Tribunals created under the Act or upon Tribunals created under Article 323B of the 
Constitution. It is to be remembered that, apart from the authorisation that flows from Articles 
232A and 323E, both Parliament and the State Legislatures possess legislative competence to effect 
changes in the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the High Courts. This power is 
available to Parliament under Entries yy, 78, 79 and 95 of List I and to the State Legislatures under 
Entry 65 of List II; Entry 46 of List III can also be availed of both by Parliament and the State 
Legislatures for this purpose. 
82. There are pressing reasons why we are anxious to preserve the conferment of such a power on 
these Tribunals. When the Framers of our Constitution bestowed the powers ofjudicial review of 
legislative action upon the High Courts and the Supreme Court, they ensured that other 
constitutional safeguards were created to assist them in effectively discharging this onerous burden. 
The expectation was that this power would be required to be used only occasionally However, in the 
five decades that have ensued since Independence, the quantity of litigation before the High Courts 
has exploded in an unprecedented manner. The decision in Sampath Kumar's case was rendered 
against such a backdrop. We are conscious of the fact that when a Constitution Bench of this Court 
in Sampath Kumar's case adopted the theory of alternative institutional mechanisms, it was 
attempting to remedy an alarming practical situation and the approach selected by it appeared to be 
most appropriate to meet the exigencies of the time. Nearly a decade later, we are now in a position 
to review the theoretical and practical results that have arisen as a consequence of thc adoption of 
such an approach. 
83. We must, at this stage, focus upon the factual position which occasioned the adoption of the 
theory of alternative institutional mechanisms in Sampath Kumar's case. In his leading judgment, R. 
Misra, J. refers to the fact that since independence, the population explosion and the increase in 
litigation had greatly increased the burden of pendency in the High Courts. Reference was made to 
I nu inn Kennon IMM todienionoon wick:ball 152518 
-93- 
L Chandra Kumar vs Union Of India And others on 18 Marcie 1997 
studies conducted towards relieving the High Courts of their increased load. In this regard, the 
recommendations of the Shah Committee for setting up independent Tribunals as also the 
suggestion of the Administrative Reforms Commission that Civil Service Tribunals be set up, were 
noted. Reference was also made to the decision in K,R. Dutta v Union of India : (198°)IILL.H82SC , 
where this Court had, while emphasising the need for speedy resolution of service disputes, 
proposed the establishment of Service Tribunals. 
84. The problem of clearing the backlogs of High Courts, which has reached colossal proportions in 
our times is, nevertheless, one that has been the focus of study far close to a half century. Over time, 
several Expert Committees and Commissions have analysed the intricacies involved and have made 
suggestions, not all of which have been consistent. Of the several studies that have been conducted 
in this regard, as many as twelve have been undertaken by the Law Commission of India 
(hereinafter referred to as "the LCI") or similar high level Committees appointed by the Central 
Government, and are particularly noteworthy. 
85. An appraisal of the daunting task which confronts the High Courts can be made by referring to 
the assessment undertaken by the LCI in its 124th Report which was released sometime after the 
judgment in Sampath Kumar's case. The Report was delivered in 1988, nine years ago, and some 
changes have occurred since, but the broad perspective which emerges is still, by and large, true: 
..The High Courts enjoy civil as well as criminal, ordinary as well as extraordinary, and general as 
well as SpeCial jUriSdietiOn. The source of the jurisdiction is the Constitution and the various statutes 
as well as letters patent and other instruments constituting the High Courts. The High Courts in the 
country enjoy an original jurisdiction in respect of testamentary, matrimonial and guardianship 
matters. Original jurisdiction is conferred on the High Courts under the Representation of the 
People Act, 1951, Companies Acto956, and several other special statutes. The High Courts, being 
courts of record, have the power to punish for its contempt as well as contempt of its subordinate 
courts. The High Courts enjoy extraordinaryjurisdiction under Articles 226 and 227 of the 
Constitution enabling it to issue prerogative writs, such as, the one in the nature of habeas corpus, 
mandamus, prohibition, QUO warranto and certiorari. Over and above this, the High Courts of 
Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Madras also exercise 
ordinary original civil jurisdiction. The High Courts also enjoy advisory jurisdiction, as evidenced by 
Section 256 of the Indian Companies Act, 1556, Section 27 of the Wealth Tax Act, 1957, Section 26 of 
Gift Tax Act, 1958, and Section 18 of Companies (Profits) Surtax Act, 1964. Similarly, there are 
parallel provisions conferring advisoryjurisdiction on the High Courts, such as Section 130 of 
Customs Act, 1962, and Section 354 of Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944. The High Courts ha 7e also 
enjoyed jurisdiction under the Indian Divorce Act, 1869, and the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 
1936. Different types of litigation coming before the High Court in exercise of its wide jurisdiction 
bear different names. The vast area of jurisdiction can be appreciated by reference to those names, 
vin, (a) first appeals; 
(b) appeals under the letters patent; (c) second appeals; (d) revision petitions; (e) criminal appeals; 
(0 criminal revisions; (g) civil and criminal references; (h) writ petitions: Ca) writ appeals; (j) 
references under direct and indirect tax laws; (f) matters arising under the Sales Tax Act; (a)

election petitions under the Representation of the People Act,; 
(m) petitions under the Companies Act, Banking Companies Act and other special Acts and (n) 
wherever the High Court has original jurisdiction, suits and other proceedings in exercise of that 
jurisdiction. This varied jurisdiction has to some extent been responsible for a very heavy institution 
of matters in the High Courts. 
86. After analysing the situation existing in the High Courts at length, the LCI made specific 
recommendations towards the establishment of specialist Tribunals thereby lending force to the 
approach adopted in Sampath Kumar's case. The LCI noted the erstwhile international judicial 
trend which pointed towards generalist courts yielding their place to specialist Tribunals. Describing 
the pendency in the High Courts as "catastrophic crisis ridden, almost unmanageable, imposing ..an 
immeasurable burden on the system", the LCI stated that the prevailing view in Indian 
Jurisprudence that the jurisdiction enjoyed by the High Court is a holy cow required a reviewIt, 
therefore, recommended the trimming of thejurisdiction of the High Courts by setting up specialist 
courts/Tribunals while simultaneously eliminating the jurisdiction of the High Courts. 
82. It is important to realise that though the theory of alternative institutional mechanisms was 
propounded in Sampath Kumar's case in respect of the Administrative Tribunals, the concept 
itself—that of creating alternative modes of dispute resolution which would relieve High Courts of 
their burden while simultaneously providing specialised justice-is not new. In fact, the issue of 
having a specialised Tax Court has been discussed for several decades; though the Report ofthe 
High Court Arrears Committee (1972) dismissed it as "ill-conceived", the LCI, in its ntith Report 
(1986) revived the recommendation of setting up separate Central Tax Courts. Similarly, other 
Reports of the LCI have suggested the setting up of 'Gram Nyayalayas' (1986) LCI, ii4th Report, 
Industrial/Labour Tribunals 1987 LCI, 122nd Report and Education Tribunals (1987) [1.0, 123rd 
Report. 
 
88. In R.IC Jain's case, this Court had, in order to understand how the theory of alternative 
institutional mechanisms had functioned in practice, recommended that the LCI or a similar expert 
body should conduct a survey of the functioning of these Tribunals. It was hoped that such a study, 
conducted after gauging the working of the Tribunals over a sizeable period of mom than five years 
would provide an answer to the questions posed by the critics of the theory. Unfortunately, we do 
not have the benefit of such a study. We may, however, advert to the Report of the Arrears 
Committee (1989-90), popularly Isnotni as the Malimath Committee Report, which has elaborately 
dealt with the aspect. The observations contained in the Report, to this extent they contain a review 
of the functioning of the Tribunals over a period of three years or so after their institution, will be 
useful for our purpose. Chapter VIII of the second volume of the Report, "Alternative Modes and 
Forums for Dispute Resolution", deals with the issue at length. After forwarding its specific 
recommendations on the feasibility of setting up 'Gram Nyayalayas', Industrial Tribunals and 
Educational Tribunals, the Committee has dealt with the issue of Tribunals set up under Articles 
323A and 3238 of the Constitution. The relevant observations in this regard, being of considerable 
significance to our analysis, arc extracted in full as under:

Functioning of Tribunals 8.63 Several tribunals are functioning in the country. Not all of them, 
however, have inspired confidence in the public mind.The reasons are not far to seek. The foremost 
is the lack of competence, objectivity and judicial approach. The next is their constitution, the power 
and method of appointment of personnel thereto, the inferior status and the casual method of 
working. The last is their actual composition; men of calibre are not willing to be appointed as 
presiding officers in view of the uncertainty of tenure, unsatisfactory-  conditions of service, executive 
subordination in matters of administration and political interference in judicial functioning. For 
these and other reasons, the quality of justice is stated to have suffered and the cause of expedition 
is not found to have been served by the establishment of such tribunals. 
8.64 Even the experiment of setting up of the Administrative Tribunals under the Administrative 
Tribunals Act, 1985, has not been widely welcomed. Its members have been selected from all kinds 
of services including the Indian Police Service. The decision of the State Administrative Tribunals 
are not appealable except under Article 136 of the Constitution. On account of the heavy cost and 
remoteness of the forum, there is virtual negation of the right of appeal. This has led to denial of 
justice in many cases and consequential dissatisfaction. There appears to be a move in some of the 
State where they have been established for their abolition. 
Tribunals--Test for Including High Court's Jurisdiction 8.6s A Tribunal which substitutes the High 
Court as an alternative institutional mechanism for judicial review must be no less efficacious than 
the High Court. Such a tribunal must inspire confidence and public esteem that it is a highly 
competent and expert mechanism with judicial approach and objectivity. What is needed in a 
tribunal, which is intended to supplant the High Court, is legal training and experience, and judicial 
acumen, equipment and approach. When such a tribunal is composed of personnel drawn from the 
judiciary as well as from services or from amongst experts in the field, any weightage in favour of the 
service members or expert members and value- discounting the judicial members would render the 
tribunal less effective and efficacious than the High Court The Act setting up such a tribunal would 
itself have to be declared as void under such circumstances. The same would not at all be conducive 
to judicial independence and may even tend, directly or indirectly, to influence their decision 
making process, especially when the Government is a litigant in most of the cases coming before 
such tribunal See S.F. Samnath Kumar v Union of I dia reported in: 0337)11.1.ha8SC . The 
protagonists of specialist tribunals, who simultaneously with their establishment want exclusion of 
the Writ jurisdiction of the High Courts in regard to matters entrusted for adjudication to such 
tribunals, ought not to overlook these vital and important aspects. It must not be forgotten that what 
is permissible to be supplant by another equally effective and efficacious institutional mechanism is 
the High Courts and not the judicial review itself. Tribunals arc not an end in themselves but a 
means to an end; even if the laudable objectives of speedyjustice, uniformity of approach, 
predictability of decisions and specialist justice are to be achieved, the frame work of the tribunal 
intended to be set up to attain them must still retain its basic judicial character and inspire public 
confidence. Any scheme of decentralisation of administration ofjustice providing for an alternative 
institutional mechanism in substitution of the High Courts must pass the aforesaid test in order to 
be constitutionally valid.

L Chandra Kumar vs Union 01 India And Others on 18 March, 1997 
8.66 The overall picture regarding the tribunalisation ofjustice in our country is not satisfactory and 
encouraging. There is a need for a fresh look and review and a serious consideration before the 
experiment is extended to new areas of fields, especially if the constitutional jurisdiction of the High 
Courts is to be simultaneously ousted. Not many tribunals satisfying the aforesaid tests can possibly 
be established. 
(Emphasis added) 
89. Having expressed itself in this manner, the Malimath Committee specifically recommended that 
the theory of alternative institutional mechanisms be abandoned. Instead, it recommended that 
institutional changes be carried out within the High Courts, dividing them into separate divisions 
for different branches of law, as is being done in England. It stated that appointing more Judges to 
an the separate divisions while using the existing infrastructure would be a better way of 
remedying the problem of pendency in the High Courts. 
90. In the years that have passed since the Report of the Malimath Committee was delivered, the 
pendency in the High Courts has substantially increased and we are of the view that its 
recommendation is not suited to our present context. That the various Tribunals have not 
performed upto expectations is a self-evident and widely acknowledged truth. However, to draw an 
inference that their unsatisfactory performance points to their being founded on a fundamentally 
unsound principle would not be correct. The reasons for which the Tribunals were constituted still 
persist; indeed, those reasons have become even more pronounced in our times. We have already 
indicated that our constitutional scheme permits the setting up of such Tribunals. However, drastic 
measures may have to be resorted to in order to elevate their standards to ensure that they stand up 
to constitutional scrutiny in the discharge of the power ofjudicial review conferred upon them. 
91. We may first address the issue of exclusion of the power of judicial review of the High Courts. We 
have already held that in respect of the power of judicial review, the jurisdiction of the High Courts 
under Article 226/227 cannot wholly be excluded. It has been contended before us that the 
Tribunals should not be allowed to adjudicate upon matters where the tires of legislations is 
questioned, and that they should restrict themselves to handling matters where constitutional issues 
are not raised. We cannot bring ourselves to agree to this proposition as that may result in splitting 
up proceedings and may cause avoidable delay. If such a view were to be adopted, it would be open 
forlitigants to raise constitutional issues, many of which may be quite frivolous, to directly approach 
the High Courts and thus subvert the jurisdiction of the Tribunals. Moreover, even in these special 
branches of law, some areas do involve the consideration of constitutional questions on a regular 
basis: for instance, in service law matters, a large majority of cases involve an interpretation of 
Articles 14, cg and 16 of the Constitution. To hold that the Tribunals have no power to handle 
matters involving constitutional issues would not sent the purpose for which they were constituted. 
On the other hand, to hold that all such decisions will be subject to the jurisdiction of the High 
Courts under Articles 226/227 of tbe Constitution before a Division Bench of the High Court uithin 
whose territorial jurisdiction the Tribunal concerned falls will serve two purposes. While saving the 
power ofjudicial review of legislative action vested in the High Courts under Article 226(227 of the 
Constitution, it will ensure that frivolous claims are filtered out through the process of adjudication 
Kanaon hap itharkanoon orgidoo11525122 	
32 
-97- 
L. Chandra Kumar vs Union Of Ind is And Others on IS March, 1997 
in the Tribunal. The High Court will also have the benefit of a reasoned decision on merits which 
will be of use to it in finally deciding the matter. 
92. It has also been contended before us that even in dealing with cases which are properly before 
the Tribunals, the manner in which justice is dispensed by them leaves much to be desired. 
Moreover, the remedy provided in the parent statutes, by way of an appeal by special leave under 
Article 136 of the Constitution, is too costly and inaccessible for it to be real and effective. 
Furthermore, the result of providing such a remedy is that the docket of the Supreme Court is 
crowded with decisions of Tribunals that are challenged on relatively trivial grounds and it is forced 
to perform the role of a First Appellate Court. We have already emphasised the necessity for 
ensuring that the High Courts are able to exercise judicial superintendence over the decisions of 
Tribunals under Article guy of the Constitution. In R.K. grain's case, after taking note of these facts, it 
was suggested that the possibility of an appeal from the Tribunals on questions of law to a Division 
Bench of a High Court within whose territorial jurisdiction the Tribunal falls, be pursued. It appears 
that no follow-up action has been taken pursuant to the suggestion. Such a measure would have 
improved matters considerably. Having regard to both the afore-stated contentions, we hold that all 
decisions of Tribunals, whether created pursuant to Article 3a3A or Article 32313 of the Constitution, 
will be subject to the High Court's writ jurisdiction under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution, 
before a Division Bench of the High Court within whose territorial jurisdiction the particular 
Tnbunal falls. 
93. We may add here that under the existing system, direct appeals have been provided from the 
decisions of all Tribunals to the Supreme Court under Article 136 of the Constitution. In view of our 
above-mentioned observations, this situation will also stand modified. In the view that we have 
taken, no appeal from the decision of a Tribunal will directly lie before the Supreme Court under 
Article 136 of the Constitution; but instead, the aggrieved party will be entitled to move the High 
Court under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution and from the decision of the Division Bench of the 
High Court the aggrieved party could move this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution. 
ug. Before moving on to other aspects, we may summarise our conclusions on the jurisdictional 
powers of these Tribunals. The Tribunals are competent to hear matters where the vires of statutory 
provisions arc questioned. However, in discharging this duty, they cannot act as substitutes for the 
High Courts and the Supreme Court which have, under our constitutional setup, been specifically 
entrusted with such an obligation. Their function in this respect is only supplementary and all such 
decisions of the Tribunals will be subject to scrutiny before a Division Bench of the respective High 
Courts. The Tribunals will consequently also have the power to test the Ares of subordinate 
legislations and rules. However, this power of the Tribunals will be subject to one important 
exception. The Tribunals shall not entertain any question regarding the tires of their parent statutes 
following the settled principle that a Tribunal which is a creature of an Act cannot declare that very 
Act to be unconstitutional. In such cases alone, the concerned High Court may be approached 
directly. All other decisions of these Tribunals, rendered in cases that they are specifically 
empowered to adjudicate upon by virtue of their parent statutes, will also be subject to scrutiny 
before a Division Bench of their respective High Courts. We may add that the Tribunals will, 
however, continue to act as the only courts of first instance in respect of the areas of law for which 
Indian Kasoon AtIrssndpankanoon callelosS152518I 	
33 
L manors Kumar VS union Of India And Oner on 15 Mann 1997 
they have been constituted. By this, we mean that it will not be open for litigants to directly 
approach the High Courts even in cases where they question the vireo of statutory legislations 
(except, as mentioned, where the legislation which creates the particular Tribunal is challenged) by 
overlooking the jurisdiction of the concerned Tribunal. 
%. The directions issued by us in respect of making the decisions of Tribunals amenable to scrutiny 
before a Division Bench of the respective High Courts will, however, come into effect prospectively 
i.e. will apply to decisions rendered hereafter. To maintain the sanctity of judicial proceedings, we • 
have invoked the doctrine of prospective over-ruling so as not to disturb the procedure in relation to 
decisions already rendered. 
96. We are also required to address the issue of the competence of those who man the Tribunals and 
the question of who is to exercise administrative supervision over them. It has been urged that only 
those who have had judicial experience should be appointed to such Tribunals. In the case of 
Administrative Tribunals, it has been pointed out that the administrative members who have been 
appointed have little or no experience in adjudicating such disputes; the Malimath Committee has 
noted that at times, IPS Officers have been appointed to these Tribunals. It is stated that in the short 
tenures that these Administrative Members are on the Tribunal, they arc unable to attain enough 
experience in adjudication and in cases where they do acquire the ability, it is invariably on the eve 
of the expiry of their tenures. For these reasons it has been urged that the appointment of 
Administrative Members to Administrative Tribunals be stopped. We find it difficult to accept such 
a contention. It must be remembered that the setting-up of these Tribunals is founded on the 
premise that specialist bodies comprising both trained administrators and those with judicial 
experience would, by virtue of their specialised knowledge, be better equipped to dispense speedy 
and Lfficient justice. It was expected that a judicious mix of judicial members and those with grass-
roots experience would best serve this purpose. To hold that the Tribunal should consist only of 
judicial members would attack the primary basis of the theory pursuant to which they have been 
constituted. Since the Selection Committee is now headed by a Judge of the Supreme Court, 
nominated by the Chief Justice of India, we have reason to believe that the Committee would take 
care to ensure that administrative members are chosen from amongst those who have some 
background to deal with such cases. 
97. It has been brought to our notice that one reason why these Tribunals have been functioning 
inefficiently is because there is no authority charged with supervising and fulfilling their 
administrative requirements. To this end, it is suggested that the Tribunals be made subject to the 
supervisory jurisdiction of the High Courts within whose territorial jurisdiction they fall. We are, 
however, of the view that this may not he the best way of solving the problem. We do not think that 
our constitutional scheme requires that all adjudicatory bodies which fall within the territorial 
jurisdiction of the High Courts should be subject to their supervisoryjurisdiction. If the idea is to 
divest the High Courts of their onerous burdens, then adding to their supervisory functions cannot, 
in any manner, be of assistance to them. The situation at present is that different Tribunals 
constituted under different enactments are administered by different administrative departments of 
the Central and the State Governments. The problem is compounded by the fact that some Tribunals 
have been created pursuant to Central Legislations and some others have been created by State

Legislations. However, even in the case of Tribunals created by Parliamentary legislations, there is 
no uniformity in administration. We are of the view that, until a wholly independent agency for the 
administration of all such Tribunals can be set-up, it is desirable that all such Tribunals should be, 
as far as possible, under a single nodal Ministry which will be in a position to oversee the working of 
these Tribunals. For a number of reasons that Ministry should appropriately be the Ministry of Law. 
It would be open for the Ministry, in its turn, to appoint an independent supervisory body to oversee 
the working of the Tribunals. This will ensure that if the President or Chairperson of the Tribunal is 
for some reason unable to take sufficient interest in the working of the Tribunal, the entire system 
mill not languish and the ultimate consumer ofjustice will not suffer. The creation of a single 
umbrella organisation will, in our view, remove many of the ills of the present system. If the need 
arises, there can be separate umbrella organisations at the Central and the State levels. Such a 
supervisory authority must try to ensure that the independence of the members of all such Tribunals 
is maintained. To that extent, the procedure for the selection of the members of the Tribunals, the 
manner in which funds arc allocated for the functioning of the Tribunals and all other consequential 
details will have to be clearly spelt out. 
98. The suggestions that we have made in respect of appointments to Tribunals and the supervision 
of their administrative function need to be considered in detail by those entrusted with the duty of 
formulating the policy in this respect. That body will also have to take into consideration the 
comments of experts bodies like the LEI and the Malimath Committee in this regard. We, therefore, 
recommend that the Union of India initiate action in this behalf and after consulting all concerned, 
place all these Tribunals under one single nodal department, preferably the Legal Department. 
99. Since we have analysed the issue of the constitutional validity of Section 5(6) of the Act at length, 
we may no pronounce our opinion on this aspect. Though the vices of the provision was not in 
question in Dr. Mahabal Ram's case, we a believe that the approach adopted in that case the 
relevant portion of which has been extracted in the first part of this judgment, is correct since it 
harmoniously resolves the manner in which Sections 5(2) and 5(6) can operate together. We wish to 
make it clear that where a question involving the interpretation of a statutory provision or rule in 
relation to the Constitution arises for the consideration of a single Member Bench of the 
Administrative Tribunal, the proviso to Section 5(6) will automatically apply and the Chairman or 
the Member concerned shall refer the matter to a Bench consisting of at least two Members, one of 
whom must be a Judicial Member. This will ensure that questions involving the wires of a statutory 
provision or rule will never arise for adjudication before a single Member Bench or a Bench which 
does not consist of a Judicial Member. So construed, Section 5(6) will no longer be susceptible to 
charges of unconstitutionality. 
moo. In view of the reasoning adopted by us, we hold that Clause 2(d) of Article 323A and Clause 
3(d) of Article 32311, to the extent they exclude the jurisdiction of the High Courts and the Supreme 
Court under Articles 226/227 and 32 of the Constitution, are unconstitutional. Section 28 of the Act 
and the "exclusion of jurisdiction" clauses in all other legislations enacted under the aegis of Articles 
323A and 323B would, to the same extent, be unconstitutional. The jurisdiction conferred upon the 
High Courts tinder Articles 226/227 and upon the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the 
Constitution is part of the inviolable basic structure of our Constitution. While this jurisdiction

cannot be ousted, other courts and Tribunals may perform a supplemental role in discharging the 
powers conferred by Articles 226/227 and 32 of the Constitution. The Tribunals created under 
Article 323A and Article 323B of the Constitution are possessed of the competence to test the 
constitutional validity of statutory provisions and rules. All decisions of these Tribunals will, 
however, be subject to scrutiny before a Division Bench of the High Court within whose jurisdiction 
the concerned Tribunal fans. The Tribunals urI11, nevertheless, continue to act like Courts of first 
instance in respect of the areas of law for which they have been constituted. It will not, therefore, be 
open for litigants to directly approach the High Courts even in cases where they question the vires of 
statutory legislations (except where the legislation which creates the particular Tribunal is 
challenged) by overlooking the jurisdiction of the concerned Tribunal. Section 5(6) of the Act is valid 
and constitutional and is to he interpreted in the manner we have indicated. 
log All these matters may now be listed before a Division Bench to enable them to be decided upon 
their individual facts in the light of the observations contained in this judgment.

The Controversy:  
1. 	
All the above cases are being disposed of by this common judgment. The 
issue which arises for consideration before us, in the present bunch of cases. 
Page 1 
• 10).- 
pertains to the constitutional validity of the National Tax Tribunal Act, 2005 
(hereinafter referred to as, the NTT Act). Simultaneously, the constitutional 
validity of the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 has been 
assailed, by asserting, that the same violates the basic structure of the 
Constitution of India (hereinafter referred to as, the Constitution), by impinging on 
the power of "judicial review" vested in the High Court. In the event of this Court 
not acceding to the aforementioned prayers, a challenge in the alternative, has 
been raised to various provisions of the NTT Act, which has led to the 
constitution of the National Tax Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as, the NTT). 
The NTT, according to the learned counsel for the petitioners, is styled as a 
quasi-judicial appellate tribunal. It has been vested with the power of 
adjudicating appeals arising from orders passed by Appellate Tribunals 
(constituted under the Income Tax Act, the Customs Act. 1962, and the Central 
Excise Act, 1944). Hitherto before, the instant jurisdiction was vested with High 
Courts. The pointed issue canvassed in this behalf is, that High Courts which 
discharge judicial functions, cannot be substituted by an extra-judicial body. 
Additionally, it is maintained that the NTT in the manner of its constitution 
undermines a process of independence and fairness, which are sine qua non of 
an adjudicatory authority. 
The Historical Perspective:  
The Income Tax Legislation in India:  
2(i). Law relating to income tax dates back to 1860, when legislation pertaining 
to levy of tax on income, was introduced in India for the first time. The original 
2 
Page 2 
--- 103 - 
enactment was replaced by subsequent legislations, enacted in 1865, 1886, 
1918 and 1922. The Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 (hereinafter referred to as, the 
1922 Act) was brought about, as a result of the recommendations of the All India 
Tax Committee. The 1922 Act can be described as a milestone in the evolution 
of direct tax laws in India. Detailed reference needs to be made to the provisions 
of the 1922 Act. 
(ii) 
After the procedure provided for assessment of tax had run its course, and 
tax had been assessed, an executive-appellate remedy was provided for, before 
the Appellate Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax (under Section 30 of the 
1922 Act). A further quasi-judicial appellate remedy, from decisions rendered by 
the first appellate authority, lay before an appellate tribunal (hereinafter referred 
to as the Appellate Tribunal). Section 33A was inserted by the Indian Income 
Tax (Amendment) Act, 1941. It provided for a remedy by way of revision before 
a Commissioner of Income Tax. 
(iii) 
The remedy before the Appellate Tribunal (provided under Section 5A of 
the 1922 Act, by Section 85 of the Indian Income Tax (Amendment) Act, 1939), 
was required to be exercised by a bench comprising of one Judicial Member and 
one Accountant Member. It was permissible for the President of the Appellate 
Tribunal or any other Member thereof, to dispose of appeals, sitting singly 
(subject to the condition, that the total income of the assessee, as computed by 
the assessing officer, did not exceed Rs.15,000/-). It was also open to the 
President of the Appellate Tribunal to constitute larger benches of three 
3 
Page 3 
-1 - 
Members (subject to the condition, that the larger bench would comprise of at 
least one Judicial Member and one Accountant Member). 
(iv) 
Section 5A of the 1922 Act, laid down the conditions of eligibility for 
appointment as a Judicial Member - a person who had served on a civil judicial 
post for 10 years was eligible, additionally an Advocate who had been practicing 
before a High Court for a period of 10 years, was also eligible. Under the 1922 
Act, a person who had practiced in accountancy as a Chartered Accountant 
(under the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949) for a period of 10 years, or was a 
Registered Accountant (or partly a Registered Accountant, and partly a 
Chartered Accountant) for a period of 10 years (under any law formerly 
enforced), was eligible for appointment as an Accountant Member. Only a 
Judicial Member could be appointed as the President of the Appellate Tribunal. 
(v) 
Section 67 of the 1922 Act, barred suits in civil courts pertaining to income 
tax related issues. Additionally, any prosecution suit or other proceedings could 
not be filed, against an officer of the Government, for an act or omission, in 
furtherance of anything done in good faith or intended to be done under the 1922 
Act. 
(vi) 
The 1922 Act, did not provide for an appellate remedy, before the 
jurisdictional High Court. The only involvement of the jurisdictional High Court, 
was under Section 66 of the 1922 Act. Under Section 66, either the assessee or 
the Commissioner of Income Tax, could move an application to the Appellate 
Tribunal, requiring it to refer a question of law (arising out of an assessment 
order) to the jurisdictional High Court. In case of refusal to make such a 
4 
Page 
reference, the aggrieved assessee or the Commissioner of Income Tax, could 
assail the refusal by the Appellate Tribunal, before the jurisdictional High Court. 
A case referred to the High Court under Section 66, was to be heard by a bench 
of not less than two judges of the High Court (Section 66A of the 1922 Act - 
inserted by the Indian Income Tax (Amendment) Act, 1926). Section 66 of the 
1922 Act, was amended by the Indian Income Tax (Amendment) Act, 1939, 
whereby the power to make a reference became determinable by the 
Commissioner of Income Tax (in place of the Appellate Tribunal). 
(vii) In exercise of the reference jurisdiction, a question of law, which had 
arisen in an appeal pending before the Appellate Tribunal, had to be determined 
by the High Court. After the jurisdictional High Court had answered the 
reference, the Appellate Tribunal would dispose of the pending appeal in 
consonance with the legal position declared by the High Court. 
3(i) The 1922 Act was repealed by the Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter 
referred to as, the Income Tax Act). As in the repealed enactment, so also under 
the Income Tax Act, an order passed by an assessing officer, was assailable 
through an executive-appellate remedy. The instant appellate remedy, was 
vested with the Deputy Commissioner (Appeals)/Commissioner (Appeals). The 
orders appealable before the Deputy Commissioner (Appeals) were distinctly 
mentioned (in Section 246 of the Income Tax Act). Likewise, the orders 
appealable before the Commissioner (Appeals) were expressly enumerated (in 
Section 246A of the Income Tax Act). 
5 
Page 5 
(ii) 
As against the order passed by the executive-appellate authority, a further 
appellate remedy was provided before a quasi-judicial appellate tribunal 
(hereinafter referred to as, the Appellate Tribunal, under Section 252 of the 
Income Tax Act). Section 255(6) of the Income Tax Act provides as under:- 
'M. 	
The Appellate Tribunal shall, for the purpose of discharging its 
functions, have all the powers which are vested in the income-tax 
authorities referred to in section 131 and any proceeding before the  
Appellate Tribunal shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the  
meanin  of sections 193 and 228 and for the purpose of section 196 of the  
Indian Penal Code (45 of 18601. and the Appellate Tribunal shall be  
deemed to be a civil court for all the purposes of section 195 and Chapter  
XXXV of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 (5 of 1898)f  
By a deeming fiction of law, therefore, the Appellate Tribunal was considered as 
a civil court , dealing with "judicial proceedings". 
(iii) 
To be eligible for appointment as the President of the 'TAT, the incumbent 
had to be a sifting or retired judge of a High Court, with not less than 7 years of 
service as a judge. Alternatively, the Central Government could appoint a Senior 
Vice President or a Vice President of the Appellate Tribunal, as its President. It 
is, therefore apparent, that the Appellate Tribunal was to be comprised of a 
President, Senior Vice President(s), Vice President(s) and Members. 
(iv) 
The benches of the Appellate Tribunal, under the Income Tax Act (was 
similar to the one under the 1922 Act), were to be comprised of at least one 
Judicial Member and one Accountant Member. The authority to constitute 
benches of the Appellate Tribunal was vested with the President. The 
composition of the benches under the Income Tax Act, was similar to that 
postulated under the 1922 Act. When authorized by the Central Government, it 
6 
Page 6 
/b7 — 
was open to the Appellate Tribunal, to dispose of appeals sitting singly (subject 
to the condition, that the appeal pertained to a dispute, wherein the concerned 
assessee's total income was assessed as not exceeding Rs.5 lakhs). The 
President of the Appellate Tribunal, had the authority to constitute special 
benches, comprising of three or more Members (one of whom had to be a 
Judicial Member, and one, an Accountant Member). In case of difference of 
opinion, the matter was deemed to have been decided in terms of the opinion 
expressed by the majority. 
(v) 
An assessee or the Commissioner, could move an application before the 
Appellate Tribunal, under Section 256 of the Income Tax Act, requiring it to make 
a reference to the High Court on a question of law (arising in an appeal pending 
before the Appellate Tribunal). In case the prayer made in the application was 
declined by the Appellate Tribunal, the order (declining the prayer) was 
assailable before the High Court. 
(vi) 
Section 257 of the Income Tax Act provided for a reference directly to the 
Supreme Court. The instant reference could be made by the Appellate Tribunal. 
if it was of the opinion, that the question of law which had arisen before it, had 
been interpreted differently, by two or more jurisdictional High Courts. 
(vii) Section 260A was inserted in the Income Tax Act by the Finance (No. 2) 
Act, 1998, with effect from 1.10.1998. Under Section 260A, an appellate remedy 
was provided for, to raise a challenge to orders passed by the Appellate Tribunal. 
The instant appellate remedy, would lie before the jurisdictional High Court. In 
terms of the mandate contained in Section 260B of the Income Tax Act, an 
7 
Page 7 
appeal before the High Court was to be heard by a bench of not less than two 
judges. The opinion of the majority, would constitute the decision of the High 
Court. Where there was no majority, on the point(s) of difference, the opinion of 
one or more judges of the High Court, was to be sought. Thereupon, the majority 
opinion of the judges (including the judges who had originally heard the case) 
would constitute the decision of the High Court. 
(viii) A further appellate remedy was available as against a decision rendered 
by the jurisdictional High Court. The instant appellate remedy was vested with 
the Supreme Court under Section 261 of the Income Tax Act, 
The Customs Legislation. in India:  
4(i). The Customs Act, 1962 (hereinafter referred to as, the Customs Act) was 
enacted to consolidate and amend the law relating to customs. The Customs Act 
vested the power of assessment of customs duty, with the Deputy Collector of 
Customs or the Collector of Customs. An executive-appellate remedy was 
provided under Section 128 of the Customs Act, before a Collector of Customs 
(where the impugned order had been passed by an officer, lower in rank to the 
Collector of Customs), and before the Central Board of Excise and Customs 
(constituted under the Central Boards of Revenue Act, 1963), where the 
impugned order had been passed by a Collector of Customs. The Board had 
also been conferred with executive revisional powers (under Section 130 of the 
Customs Act), to suo moth, or on an application of an aggrieved person, examine 
the record of any proceeding, pertaining to a decision or order under the 
provisions of the Customs Act. Revisional powers, besides those expressly 
8 
Page 
05 - 
vested in the Board (under Section 130 of the Customs Act), were also vested 
with the Central Government (under Section 131 of the Customs Act). 
(ii) 
By the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1980, Sections 128 to 131 of the original Act 
were substituted. The power to entertain the first executive-appellate remedy, 
was now vested with the Collector (Appeals), under Sections 128 and 128A of 
the Customs Act. On exhaustion of the above remedy. a further quasi-judicial 
appellate remedy was provided for, under Sections 129 and 129A before the 
Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to 
as, the CEGAT/Appellate Tribunal). CEGAT was also the appellate authority, 
against orders passed by the Board. With introduction of Service Tax, under 
Chapter V of the Finance Act, 1994, CEGAT was conferred the jurisdiction to 
hear appeals in cases pertaining to service tax disputes as well. The Appellate 
Tribunal is now known as the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate 
Tribunal — the CESTAT. By Act 22 of 2003, the expression "Gold (Control)" was 
substituted with ''Service Tax" in the definition of the "Appellate Tribunal" (w.e.f. 
14.5.2003). 
(iii) 
Section 129 of the Customs Act delineated the constitution of the CEGAT. 
It was to comprise of as many Judicial and Technical Members, as the Central 
Government thought fit. The instant provision, also laid down the conditions of 
eligibility for appointment of Judicial/Technical Members. A Judicial Member 
could be chosen out of persons, who had held a civil judicial post for at least 10 
years, or out of persons who had been in practice as an Advocate for at least 10 
years, as also, from out of Members of the Central Legal Service (not below 
9 
Page 9 
lip 
Graded), who had held such post for at least 3 years. A Technical Member could 
be appointed out of persons. who had been members of the Indian Customs and 
Central Excise Service (Group A), subject to the condition, that such persons had 
held the post of Collector of Customs or Central Excise (Level I), or equivalent or 
higher post, for at least 3 years. The Finance (No.2) Act, 1996 amended Section 
129(3) of the Customs Act, whereby it enabled the Central Government to 
appoint a person to be the President of the Appellate Tribunal. The Central 
Government could make such appointment, subject to the condition, that the 
person concerned had been a judge of the High Court, or was one of the 
Members of the Appellate Tribunal. Likewise, it was open to the Central 
Government to appoint one or more Members of the Appellate Tribunal to be its 
Vice President(s). 
(iv) Powers and functions of the Appellate Tribunal were to be exercised 
through benches constituted by its President, from amongst Members of the 
Appellate Tribunal (in terms of Section 129C of the Customs Act). Each bench 
was required to be comprised of at least one Judicial Member and one Technical 
Member. It was open to the President to constitute a special bench of not less 
than three Members (comprising of at least one Judicial and one Technical 
Member). The composition of the bench, was modified by an amendment which 
provided, that a special bench of the Appellate Tribunal was to consist of not less 
than two Members (instead of three). It was also open to the President and/or 
Members (as authorized by the President of the Appellate Tribunal) to dispose of 
appeals, sitting singly, subject to the condition, that the value of goods 
10 
Page 10 
confiscated, or the difference in duty involved, or duty involved, or the amount of 
fine or penalty involved, did not exceed Rs.10,000/- — the limit was first revised to 
Rs.50,000/), then to Rs.1 lakh, later to Rs.10 lakhs, and at present, the same is 
Rs.50 lakhs. A case involving a dispute where the determination of any question 
having a relation to the rate of duty of customs or to the value of goods for 
purposes of assessment is the sole or one of the points in issue, must however 
be heard by a bench comprising of a Judicial and a Technical Member [Section 
129C(4)(b)] In case of difference of opinion on any point(s), the opinion of the 
majority was to constitute the decision of the Appellate Tribunal. If Members 
were equally divided, the appeal was to be referred by the President, for hearing 
on such point(s), by one or more other Members of the Appellate Tribunal. 
Whereupon, the majority opinion was to be considered as the decision of the 
Appellate Tribunal. Sub-sections (7) and (8) of Section 129C provided as under:- 
"(7) The Appellate Tribunal shall, for the purposes of discharging its 
functions, have the same powers as are vested in a court under the Code 
of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), when trying a suit in respect of the 
following matters, namely:- 
(a) 
discovery and inspection; 
(b) 
enforcing the attendance of any person and examining him on 
oath; 
(c) 
compelling the production of books of account and other 
documents; and 
(d) 
issuing commissions. 
(8) Any proceeding before the Appellate Tribunal shall be deemed to be  
a judicial proceeding within the meaning of Sections 193 and 228 and for 
the purpose of Section 196 of the Indian Penal Code 945 of 1860) and the 
Appellate Tribunal shall be deemed to be a Civil Court for all the purposes 
of Section 195 and Chapter XXVI of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 1973 
(2 of 1974)." 
I I 
Page 11 
IIR 
It is apparent from the above provision, that by a fiction of law, proceedings 
before the Appellate Tribunal are treated as judicial proceedings. 
(v) The Customs and Excise Revenues Appellate Tribunal Act, 1986 came 
into force with effect from 23.121986. Section 26 of the instant enactment, 
excluded the jurisdiction of courts except the Supreme Court. Section 28 thereof 
provided as under'- 
"28. Proceedings before the Appellate Tribunal to be judicial proceedings 
— ailproceedinas before the Appellate Tribunal shall be deemed to be  
judicial proceedings within the meaning of Sections 193, 219 and 228 of 
the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).'' 
A perusal of the above amendment reveals, that by a fiction of law, the Appellate 
Tribunal was deemed to be discharging "judicial proceedings". Therefore, the 
position prevailing prior to the amendment, was maintained, so far as the instant 
aspect was concerned. 
(vi) Just as in the case of the 1922 Act, which did not provide for an appellate 
remedy, but allowed a reference to be made to a jurisdictional High Court, under 
Section 66, likewise, Section 130 of the Customs Act provided for a reference on 
a question of law, to the High Court. A reference could be made, on an 
application by the Collector of Customs or the person on whom customs duty has 
been levied, to the Appellate Tribunal. If the Appellate Tribunal refused to make 
a reference, the aggrieved party could assail the determination of the Appellate 
Tribunal, before the jurisdictional High Court. Where a reference on a question 
of law was entertained, it had to be heard by a bench of not less than two judges 
of the High Court. In case of difference of opinion on any point(s), the opinion 
12 
Page 12 
- 113 — 
expressed by the majority, was to be treated as the decision of the High Court. 
Where the opinion was equally divided, on the point(s) of difference, the matter 
was to be heard by one or more other judges of the High Court. Thereupon, the 
majority opinion of the judges (including the judges who had originally heard the 
case) would constitute the decision of the High Court. A decision of the High 
Court, would then be applied by the Appellate Tribunal, for the disposal of the 
appeal wherefrom the reference had arisen. 
(vii) The Appellate Tribunal was also authorized to make a reference directly to 
the Supreme Court (under Section 130A of the Customs Act). This could be 
done, in case the Appellate Tribunal was of the view, that there was a conflict of 
decisions of High Courts in respect of a question of law pending before it for 
decision. The decision of the Supreme Court, would then be applied by the 
Appellate Tribunal, for the disposal of the appeal out of which the reference had 
arisen. 
(viii) The Finance (No. 32) Act, 2003 introduced a new Section 130. The 
remedy of a reference to the jurisdictional High Court, was substituted by a 
remedy of an appeal to the High Court. The amended Section 130 of the 
Customs Act provided, that an appeal would lie to the High Court from every 
order passed by the Appellate Tribunal (on or after 1.7.2003), subject to the 
condition, that the High Court was satisfied, that the case involved a substantial 
question of law. In such an eventuality, the High Court would formulate the 
substantial question(s) of law. It was open to the High Court in exercise of its 
instant appellate jurisdiction, also to determine any issue which had not been 
13 
Page 13 
, II 
decided by the Appellate Tribunal, or had been wrongly decided by the Appellate 
Tribunal. The appeal preferred before the High Court, could be heard by a bench 
of not less than two judges. 
(ix) 
After amendment to Section 130, Section 130E was also amended. The 
latter amended provision, provided for an appeal to the Supreme Court, from a 
judgment of the Hiah Court, delivered on an appeal filed under Section 130, or on 
a reference made under Section 130 by the Appellate Tribunal (before 1.7.2003), 
or on a reference made under Section 130A 
(x) 
The NTT Act omitted Sections 130, 130A, 1308, 130C and 130D of the 
Customs Act. The instant enactment provided for an appeal from every order 
passed by the Appellate Tribunal to the NTT, subject to the condition, that the 
NTT arrived at the satisfaction, that the case involved a substantial question of 
law. On admission of an appeal, the NTT would formulate the substantial 
question of law for hearing the appeal. Section 23 of the NTT Act provided, that 
on and from the date, to be notified by the Central Government, all matters and 
proceedings including appeals and references, pertaining to direct/indirect taxes, 
pending before the High Court, would stand transferred to the NTT. Section 24 
of the NTT Act provides for an appeal from an order passed by the NTT, directly 
to the Supreme Court. 
The Central Excise Legislation. in India:  
5(I). The Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944 (hereinafter referred to as, the 
Excise Act) was enacted to consolidate and amend, the law related to central 
duties on excise, and goods manufactured and produced in India, and to salt. 
:4 
Page 19 
Under the said enactment, the power to assess the duty, was vested with the 
Assistant Collectors of Central Excise, and Collectors of Central Excise. An 
executive-appellate remedy was provided for under Section 35 before the 
Commissioner (Appeals). 
(II) 	
The Board was vested with revisional jurisdicfion. Revisional jurisdiction 
was additionally vested with the Central Government, In 1972, the Board was 
empowered under Section 35A of the Excise Act, to exercise the power of 
revision, from a decision/order/rule made/passed, under the Excise Act, subject 
to the condition, that no revision would he under the instant provision, as against 
an appellate order passed under Section 35 of the Excise Act, by the 
Commissioner (Appeals). The Central Government was vested with revisional 
jurisdiction against appellate orders passed by the Commissioner (Appeals) 
under Section 35, In 1978, the revisional jurisdiction which hitherto before lay 
with the Board, was vested with the Collector of Central Excise. 
(iii) 	
On the exhaustion of the first executive-appellate remedy, a further quasi- 
judicial appellate remedy was provided for, under Section 358 of the Excise Act, 
to an Appellate Tribunal. The remedy of appeal before the Appellate Tribunal, 
could be availed of (a) against a decision or order passed by the Collector of 
Central Excise as an adjudicating authority, (b) against an order passed by the 
Collector (Appeals) under Section 35A of the Excise Act (as substituted by the 
Finance (No. 2) Act, 1980), (c) against an order passed by the Board or the 
Appellate Collector of Central Excise under Section 35 (as it stood before 
:5 
Page 15 
_11b- 
21.8.1980), and (d) against an order passed by the Board or the Collector of 
Central Excise under Section 35A (as it stood before 21.8.1980). 
(iv) The Appellate Tribunal was to be comprised of such number of 
Judicial/Technical Members as the Central Government would think fit. 
Appointment of Judicial Members could only be made from amongst persons 
who had held a judicial office in India for at least 10 years, or who had been 
practicing as an Advocate for at least 10 years, or who had been a member of 
the Indian Legal Service (having held a post in Grade I of the said service, or any 
equivalent or higher post) for at least 3 years. Only such persons could be 
appointed as Technical Members who had been, members of the Indian 
Customs and Central Excise Service, Group A, and had held the post of 
Collector of Customs or Central Excise (or any equivalent or higher post) for at 
least 3 years. The Central Government had the power to appoint a person, who 
was or had been a judge of a High Court, or who was one of the Members of the 
Appellate Tribunal, as the President of the Appellate Tribunal. The functions of 
the Appellate Tribunal were to be discharged through benches constituted by its 
President. The Central Government also had the authority to appoint one or 
more Members of the Appellate Tribunal as Vice-President(s). Each bench was 
to consist of at least one Judicial Member and one Technical Member. In case of 
difference of opinion on any point(s), the opinion of the majority would constitute 
the decision of the Appellate Tribunal. If the Members of the bench were equally 
divided, the President was required to refer the disputed opinion for hearing, on 
the point(s) of difference, by one or more other Members of the Appellate 
16 
Page 16 
- 117- 
 
Tribunal. The majority opinion after such reference, would be the decision of the 
Appellate Tribunal. It was also permissible for the President, and the Members 
(authorized by the President) of the Appellate Tribunal, to hear and dispose of 
appeals, sitting singly (subject to the condition, that the difference in duty or the 
duty involved, or the amount of fine or penalty involved, did not exceed 
Rs.10,000/- -- the limit was first revised to Rs.50,000/-, then to Rs.1 lakh, later 
to Rs 10 lakhs, and at present, the same is Rs.50 lakhs). Similar provision (as in 
respect of appeals to the Appellate Tribunal under Customs Act) with regard to 
matters to be heard by a division bench, is enjoined in Section 35D(3)(a) of the 
Excise Act. 
(v) 
The Customs and Excise Revenues Appellate Tribunals Act, 1986, came 
into force on 23.12.1986. Section 26 of the instant enactment excluded the 
jurisdiction of courts except the Supreme Court. Section 14, provided for 
jurisdiction, powers and authority of the Appellate Tribunal. Section 28 provided 
as under:- 
"28. Proceedings before the Appellate Tribunal to be judicial proceedings 
— All proceedings before the Appellate Tribunal shall be deemed to be  
'fic within the meaning of Sections 193, 219 and 228 of 
the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860)." 
A perusal of the above amendment reveals, that by a fiction of law, the Appellate 
Tribunal was deemed to be discharging "judicial proceedings". 
(vi) 
Section 35G provided for a reference on any question of law, by the 
Appellate Tribunal, to the High Court. The aforesaid remedy could be availed of 
by filing an application before the Appellate Tribunal. Such an application could 
be filed by either the Collector of Central Excise, or the person on whom the 
17 
Page 17 
— 
excise duty was levied. A reference, on a question of law. made by the Appellate 
Tribunal, to the High Court, would be heard by a bench of not less than two 
judges. On the Appellate Tribunal's refusal to refer a question of law, the 
aggrieved party could assail the decision of the Appellate Tribunal (declining to 
make a reference), before the High Court. The jurisdictional High Court, on the 
acceptance of a reference, would render its decision, on the question of law. In 
case of difference of opinion, the opinion expressed by the majority would 
constitute the decision of the High Court. If the opinion by the bench was equally 
divided, the paint(s) of difference were to be heard by one or more other judges 
of the High Court, whereafter, the opinion expressed by the majority would be 
treated as the decision of the High Court. The Appellate Tribunal would 
thereupon, decide the pending appeal, in consonance with the decision rendered 
by the High Court. 
(vii) Section 35H of the Excise Act provided for a reference, by the Appellate 
Tribunal, directly to the Supreme Court. The instant reference by the Appellate 
Tribunal, could be made after the Appellate Tribunal had arrived at the 
conclusion, that the question of law arising for adjudication in an appeal pending 
before it, was differently interpreted by two or more jurisdictional High Courts. 
The decision of the Supreme Court, would then be applied by the Appellate 
Tribunal, to decide the pending appeal. Section 35L provided for appeal to the 
Supreme Court against the judgment rendered by the High Court (upon a 
reference made to the High Court by the Appellate Tribunal). The decision of the 
18 
Page 18 
Supreme Court would then be applied by the Appellate Tribunal, in the disposal 
of the appeal pending before it. 
(viii) The Finance (No. 32) Act, 2003 substituted Section 35G of the Excise Act 
and in place of the remedy of reference, the amended provision provided for a 
direct appeal to the jurisdictional High Court (after the cut-off date, i.e., 1.7.2003). 
The jurisdictional High Court was to entertain an appeal from an order passed by 
the Appellate Tribunal, on its being satisfied, that the appeal raised a substantial 
question of law. In such an eventuality, the High Court would formulate the 
substantial quesfion(s) of law. It was open to the High Court in exercise of its 
instant appellate jurisdiction, also to determine any issue which had not been 
decided by the Appellate Tribunal, or had wrongly been decided by the Appellate 
Tribunal. The appeal preferred before the High Court, would be heard by a 
bench of not less than two judges. Section 35L of the Excise Act was also 
amended. The amended provision provided for an appeal from any judgment of 
the High Court (in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction under Section 35G of the 
Excise Act, or on a reference made under Section 35G by the Appellate Tribunal 
before 1.7.2003, or on a reference made under Section 35H), to the Supreme 
Court. 
(ix) The NTT Act omitted Sections 35G, 35H, 351 and 35J of the Excise Act. 
The instant enactment provided for an appeal from every order passed by the 
Appellate Tribunal to the NTT, subject to the condition, that the NTT was 
satisfied, that the case involved a substantial question of law. On admission of 
an appeal, the NTT would formulate the substantial question of law, for hearing 
19 
Page 19 
-120 - 
the appeal. Section 23 of the NTT Act provided, that on and from the date to be 
notified by the Central Government, all matters and proceedings including 
appeals and references, pertaining to direct/indirect taxes, pending before the 
jurisdictional High Courts, would stand transferred to the NTT. Section 24 of the 
NTT Act provided for an appeal from an order passed by the NTT, to the 
Supreme Court. 
Facts leading to the promulgation of the NTT Act:  
6. 	
The first Law Commission of independent India was established in 1955 
for a three year term under the chairmanship of Mr. M.C. Setalvad, who was also 
the first Attorney General for India. The idea of constituting a 'National Tax 
Court" was mooted by the first Law Commission in its 12th  Report, suggesting the 
abolition of the existing appellate tribunal, under the framework of the Income 
Tax Act. It recommended a direct appeal to the High Courts, from orders passed 
by appellate Commissioners. This recommendation was not accepted. 
7. 	
A Direct Taxes Enquiry Committee was set up by the Government of India 
in 1970, with Mr. K.N. Wanchoo a retired Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of 
India, as its Chairman. The Enquiry Committee was assigned the following 
objectives: (1) to recommend ways to check avoidance of tax, through various 
legal lacunae; (2) to examine the exemptions allowed by tax laws, and evaluate 
scope of their reduction: and (3) to suggest methods for better tax assessment. 
and improvements in tax administration. 	
The Wanchoo Committee 
recommended creation of a "National Court", which would be comprised of 
20 
?age 20 
judges with special knowledge of tax laws. The recommendation made by the 
Wanchoo Committee, was for creation of permanent "Tax Benches" in High 
Courts, and appointment of retired judges to such benches, under Article 224A of 
the Constitution. The suggestion was aimed at clearing the backlog of tax cases. 
The Wanchoo Committee did not suggest the establishment of any separate tax 
courts as that, according to the Committee, would involve an amendment to the 
provisions of the Constitution, besides other statutory and procedural changes. 
B. 	
Another Direct Tax Laws Committee was constituted in 1977, under the 
chairmanship of Mr. N.K. Palkhivala, an eminent jurist. The Committee was later 
headed by Mr G.C. Choke', The Committee was constituted, to examine and 
suggest legal and administrative measures, for simplification and rationalization 
of direct tax laws. The Choksi Committee recommended the establishment of a 
"Central Tax Court" with an all-India jurisdiction. It was suggested, that such a 
court be constituted under a separate statute. Just like the recommendations of 
the Wanchoo Committee, the recommendations of the Chokst Committee also 
necessitated amendments in the provisions of the Constitution. As an interim 
measure to the above recommendation, the Choksi Committee suggested, the 
desirability of constituting ''Special Tax Benches' in High Courts, to deal with the 
large number of pending tax cases, by continuous sitting throughout the year. It 
was also suggested, that judges who sit on the "Special Tax Benches', should be 
selected from those who had special knowledge, to deal with matters relating to 
direct tax laws. The Choksi Committee recommended, that the judges selected 
for the "Special Tax Benches" would be transferred to the "Central Tax Court", as 
21 
Page 21 
ia~- 
and when the same was constituted. It is, therefore apparent, that according to 
the recommendations of the Choksi Committee, the "Central Tax Court" was to 
comprise of judges of High Courts, or persons qualified to be appointed as High 
Court Judges. The recommendations of the Choksi Committee reveal, that the 
suggested "Central Tax Court" would be a special kind of High Court, to deal with 
issues pertaining to direct tax laws. This was sought to be clarified in paragraph 
622 of the Choksi Committee's Report. 
9. 	
None of the recommendations referred to hereinabove were implemented, 
till a similar recommendation was again mooted in the early 1990s. After 
deliberating on the issue for a few years, the Union of India promulgated the 
National Tax Tribunal Ordinance, 2003. The Ordinance inter aka provided, for 
the transfer of appellate jurisdiction (under direct tax laws) vested in High Courts, 
to the NTT. After the Ordinance lapsed, the National Tax Tribunal Bill, 2004 was 
introduced. The said Bill was referred to a Select Committee of the Parliament. 
The Select Committee granted a personal hearing to a variety of stakeholders, 
including the representatives of the Madras Bar Association (i.e., the petitioner 
before this Court in Transferred Case (C) no. 150 of 2006). The Committee 
presented its report on 2.8.2005. In its report, it suggested serious reservations 
on the setting up of the NTT. The above Bill was presented before the Lok 
Sabha in 2005. The Bill expressed four main reasons for setting up the NTT: (1) 
to reduce pendency of huge arrears, that had mounted in High Courts all over the 
country, (2) huge tax recovery was statedly held up, in tax litigation before 
various High Courts, which directly impacted implementation of national 
22 
Page 22 
-1023 — 
projects/welfare schemes of the Government of India. (3) to have a uniformity in 
the interpretation of tax laws. In this behalf it was suggested, that different 
opinions were expressed by different High Courts on identical tax issues, 
resulting in the litigation process being tied up in higher Courts, and (4) the 
existing judges dealing with tax cases, were from civil courts, and therefore, were 
not well-versed to decide complicated tax issues. 
The issues canvassed on behalf of the petitioners:  
10. The submissions advanced on behalf of the petitioners, for purposes of 
convenience, deserve to be examined from a series of distinct and separate 
perspectives. Each perspective is truly an independent submission. It is, 
therefore necessary, in the first instance, to clearly describe the different 
submissions, advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the petitioners. 
The same are accordingly being delineated hereunder:- 
The first contention: 	
That the reasons for setting up the NTT, were fallacious 
and non-existent. Since the foundational basis is untrue, the structure erected 
thereupon, cannot be accepted as valid and justified. And therefore, the same is 
liable to be struck down. 
The second contention: It is impermissible for the legislature to abrogate/divest 
the core judicial appellate functions, specially the functions traditionally vested 
with the High Court. Furthermore, the transfer of such functions to a quasi-
judicial authority, devoid of essential ingredients of the superior court, sought to 
be replaced was constitutionally impermissible, and was liable to be set aside. 
Besides the appellate jurisdiction, the power of judicial review vested in High 
23 
Page 23 
-taut - 
Courts under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, has also been negated by 
the NTT Act. And therefore, the same be set aside. 
The third contention: Separation of powers, the rule of law, and judicial review, 
constitute amongst others, the basic structure of the Constitution. Article 323B 
inserted by the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976, to the extent it 
is violative of the above mentioned components of the basic structure of the 
Constitution., is liable to be declared ultra vices the Constitution. 
The fourth contention: A number of provisions including Sections 5, 6, 7, 8 and 
13 of the NH Act, undermine the independence of the adjudicatory process 
vested in the NTT, and as such, are liable to be set aside in their present format. 
11. 
We shall now narrate each of the above contentions advanced by the 
learned counsel for the petitioners, in the manner submissions were advanced 
before us. 
The first contention:  
12. 
As regards arrears of tax related cases before High Courts is concerned, it 
was submitted, that the figures indicated by the Department were incorrect. In 
this behalf it was asserted, that the stance adopted at the behest of the Revenue, 
that there were about 80,000 cases pending in different courts, was untrue. It 
was the emphatic contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners, that as of 
October, 2033 (when the National Tax Tribunal Ordinance, was promulgated), 
the arrears were approximately 29,000. Of the total pendency. a substantial 
number was only before a few High Courts, including the High Court of Bombay 
and the High Court of Delhi. In the petition filed by the Madras Bar Association, it 
24 
Page 21 
was asserted, that in the Madras High Court, the pending appeals under Section 
260A of the Income Tax Act, were less than 2,000. It was also sought to be 
asserted, that the pendency of similar appeals in most southern States was even 
lesser. It was pointed out, that the pendency of such appeals in the High Court 
of Karnataka and the High Court of Kerala, was even lesser than 2,000. 
13. 	
In respect of the Revenues assertion, that huge tax recovery was held up, 
in tax litigation, before High Courts, it was submitted, that the figures projected at 
the behest of the Department were incorrect. It was pointed out, that according 
to the Revenue, the pending cases in the High Courts involved an amount of 
approximately Rs.80,000 crores (relatable to direct tax cases). It was submitted, 
that the figures projected by the Department, included not only the basic tax, but 
interest and penalty imposed thereon, as well. It was pointed out, that interest 
could be as high as 40% per annum, under tax statutes, besides penal interest. 
It was accordingly sought to be canvassed, that if the main appeals were set 
aside by the High Court, there would hardly be any dues payable to the 
Government at all. Additionally, it was sought to be asserted, that many tax 
appeals pending before the High Courts, were filed by assessees, and 
accordingly, in the event of the assessees succeeding, the amount could not be 
considered as having been held up, but may have to be refunded. It was further 
asserted, that in most cases, the Revenue was able to recover a substantial 
amount from the assessees, by the time the matter reached the High Court (on 
account of pre-deposits). It was, therefore sought to be submitted, that the 
25 
Page 25 
figures indicated by the Revenue, with reference to the amount of tax held up in 
pending cases, before High Courts was wholly flawed and deceptive. 
14. 	
It was also the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners, that 
the mere establishment and creation of the NTT, would not result in uniformity of 
decisions pertaining to tax laws. In this behalf it was sought to be asserted, that 
just as in the manner two High Courts could differ with one another, so also, 
could two tax benches, of the NTT. On the factual front, it was pointed out that 
divergence of opinion in High Courts was very rare. It was, as a matter of 
approximation, suggested, that in most cases (approximately 99%), one High 
Court would follow the view taken by another High Court. Learned counsel, 
however pointed out, that in High Courts an age-old mechanism, to resolve 
conflicts of views, by either placing such matters before larger benches, or before 
a higher court, was in place. Pointing out illustratively to the FAT and the 
CESTAT, it was asserted, that there had been many cases of divergence of 
opinion, which were resolved by larger benches. R was, therefore sought to be 
canvassed, that the instant basis for constituting the NTT, was also not based on 
a prudent or sensible rationale. 
15. On the subject of High Court Judges being not well-versed to determine 
complicated interpretation of tax-law related issues, it was submitted, that the 
very mention of the above as a basis, for creating the NTT, was extremely 
unfortunate. It was submitted, that well before the independence of this country, 
and even thereafter, High Courts have been interpreting and construing tax 
related disputes, in a legitimate, tenable and lawful manner. The fairness and 
26 
Page 26 
- 1,27 - 
rationale of tax related issues, according to learned counsel, was apparent from 
the faith reposed in High Courts both by the Revenue, as well as, by the 
assessees. Furthermore, the veracity and truthfulness, of the instant assertion, 
according to the learned counsel, could be gauged from the fact, that 
interference by the Supreme Court, in the orders passed by the High Courts on 
tax matters, has been minimal. 
16. 	
During the course of hearing, our attention was also invited to the fact, that 
the legislations of the instant nature would have a lopsided effect. In this behalf it 
was sought to be pointed out, that while jurisdiction vested in High Courts was 
being excluded, the burden was being transferred to the Supreme Court of India. 
This assertion was sought to be substantiated by the learned counsel for the 
petitioners, by inviting our attention to the legislations, wherein the power of 
judicial review traditionally vested in the High Courts, has been excluded, and a 
remedy of appeal has been provided from the tribunals constituted directly to the 
Supreme Court. In this behalf, reference may illustratively be made to the 
following provisions:- 
(i) 
The Electricity Act, 2003 
125. Appeal to Supreme Court - Any person aggrieved by any 
decision or order of the Appellate Tribunal, may, file an appeal to the 
Supreme Court within sixty days from the date of communication of 
the decision or order of the Appellate Tribunal to him, on any one or 
more of the grounds specified in Section 100 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908): 
Provided that the Supreme Court may, if it is satisfied that the 
appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing the appeal 
within the said period, allow it to be filed within a further period not 
exceeding sixty days. 
(ii) 
The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 
Page 27 
— ag -- 
Section 22. Appeal to Supreme Court — Any person aggrieved by 
any award, decision or order of the tribunal, may, file an appeal to 
the Supreme Court, within ninety days from the date of 
communication of the award, decision or order of Tribunal, to him, 
on any one or mare of the grounds specified in Section 100 of the 
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) 
Provided that the Supreme Court may, entertain any appeal after the 
expiry of ninety days, if it is satisfied that the appellant was 
prevented by sufficient cause from preferring the appeal. 
(iii) 	
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1997 
Section 18. Appeal to Supreme Court — (1) Notwithstanding 
anything contained in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) 
or in any other law, an appeal shall lie against any order, not being 
an interlocutory order, of the Appellate Tribunal to the Supreme 
Court on one or more of the grounds specified in section 100 of that 
code. 
(2) 
No appeal shall lie against any decision or order made by the 
Appellate Tribunal with the consent of the parties. 
(3) 
Every appeal under this section shall be preferred within a 
period of ninety days from the date of the decision or order appealed 
against: 
Provided that the Supreme Court may entertain the appeal after the 
expiry of the said period of ninety days, if it is satisfied that the 
appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from preferring the 
appeal in time. 
(iv) 
The Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 
Section 15Z. Appeal to Supreme Court. — Any person aggrieved by 
any decision or order of the Securities Appellate Tribunal may file an 
appeal to the Supreme Court within sixty days from the date of 
communication of the decision or order of the Securities Appellate 
Tribunal to him on any question of law arising out to such order: 
Provided that the Supreme Court may, if it is satisfied that the 
applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing the appeal 
within the said period, allow it to be filed within a further period not 
exceeding sixty days. 
(v) 
Companies Act, 1956 
Section 10GF. Appeal to Supreme Court. — Any person aggrieved 
by any decision or order of the Appellate Tribunal may file an appeal 
to the Supreme Court within sixty days from the date of 
communication of the decision or order of the Appellate Tribunal to 
him on any question of law arising out of such decision or order' 
Provided that the Supreme Court may, if it is satisfied that the 
appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing the appeal 
within the said period, allow it to be filed within a further period not 
exceeding sixty days. 
28

17. 
It was also pointed out, that the enactment of the NTT Act per se lacks 
bonafides. In this behalf the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner 
was, that there is a Parliamentary convention that if a Select Committee rejects a 
Bill, it is normally not passed by the Parliament. At the very least, the 
reservations expressed by the Select Committee are taken into account, and the 
Bill in question is appropriately modified. It was submitted, that the bill under 
reference was presented before the Lok Sabha on 29.11.2005, and the same 
was passed without making a single amendment. 
18. 
It was. therefore, the vehement contention of the learned counsel for the 
petitioners, that the foundational facts being incorrect, and the manner in which 
the bill was passed, being devoid of bonafides, the legislation itself i.e.. the NTT 
Act, deserved to be set aside. 
The second contention'.  
19. 
It was the emphatic contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners, 
that it was impermissible for the legislature to abrogate/divest the core judicial 
appellate functions traditionally vested with the High Court, and to confer/vest the 
same, with an independent quasi-judicial authority, which did not even have the 
basic ingredients of a superior Court, like the High Court (whose jurisdiction is 
sought to be transferred). In conjunction with the instant contention, it was also 
the submission of the learned counsel, that the jurisdiction vested in the High 
Courts under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, is not only in respect of the 
rightful implementation of statutory provisions, but also of supervisory jurisdiction, 
over courts and tribunals, cannot be curtailed under any circumstances. 
29 
Page 29 
— 136 -- 
2D. 	
In order to supplement the instant contention, learned counsel also placed 
reliance on Article 225 of the Constitution which is being extracted hereunder:- 
"225. Jurisdiction of existing High Courts - Subject to the provisions of this 
Constitution and to the provisions of any law of the appropriate Legislature 
made by virtue of powers conferred on that Legislature by this Constitution, 
the jurisdiction of, and the law administered in, any existing High Court, 
and the respective powers of the Judges thereof in relation to the 
administration of justice in the Court, including any power to make rules of 
Court and to regulate the sittings of the court and of members thereof 
sitting alone or in Division Courts shall be the same as immediately before 
the commencement of this Constitution: 
Provided that any restriction to which the exercise of original jurisdiction by 
any of the High Courts with respect to any matter concerning the revenue 
or concerning any act ordered or done in the collection thereof was subject 
immediately before the commencement of this Constitution shall no longer 
apply to the exercise of such jurisdiction." 
Inviting the Court's attention to the proviso to Article 225 of the Constitution it was 
submitted, that the original jurisdiction of High Courts on matters pertaining to 
revenue or the collection thereof, even if considered as barred, the said bar was 
ordered to be expressly done away with, by the proviso to Article 225 of the 
Constitution. In the present context, learned counsel for the petitioners invited 
our attention to Section 226(1) of the Government of India Act, 1935. The said 
Section is reproduced hereunder:- 
'226(1) 	
Until otherwise provided by Act of the appropriate Legislature, 
no High Court shall have any original Jurisdiction in any matter concerning 
the revenue, or concerning any act ordered or done in the collection 
thereof according to the usage and practice of the country or the law for 
the time being in force." 
It was submitted, that under the above statutory provision, a High Court could not 
issue a writ in the nature of mandamus, to call upon a Revenue authority to 
discharge its statutory obligations, in respect of the assessment of tax. Likewise. 
30 
Page 30 
-131 - 
it was not open to the High Court, to issue a writ in the nature of certiorari or 
certiorarifed mandamus, in order to set aside or modify an order of assessment, 
passed in violation of or in contravention of any statutory provision(s). It was 
submitted, that the proviso to Article 225 of the Constitution, as has been 
extracted hereinabove, was omitted by the Constitution (Forty-second 
Amendment) Act, 1976 (with effect from 1.2.1977). It was however pointed out, 
that the Parliament having realized its mistake, restored the proviso to Article 225 
of the Constitution, as was originally enacted by the Constitution (Forty-fourth 
Amendment) Act, 1978 (with effect from 20.A1979). Thus viewed, according to 
the learned counsel for the petitioners, under the provisions of the Constitution, 
prevailing at the present juncture, the original jurisdiction of the High Court (i.e., 
the jurisdiction under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution), as also, the law 
administered by a High Court at the time of enactment of the Constitution, cannot 
be restricted. Accordingly, it was asserted, that on matters pertaining to revenue 
or the collection thereof, the adjudication authority of High Courts, could not be 
curtailed. 
21. Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, on which emphatic reliance has 
been placed by the learned counsel, are being reproduced hereunder:- 
"226. Power of High Courts to issue certain writs — 
(1) Notwithstanding anything in article 32, every High Court shall have 
power, throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises 
urisdiction, to issue to any person or authority, including in appropriate 
cases, any Government, within those territories directions, orders or writs, 
ncluding writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo 
warrant° and certiorari, or any of them, for the enforcement of any of the 
rights conferred by Part III and for any other purpose. 
Page 31 
1S2 - 
(2) 	
The power conferred by clause (1) to issue directions, orders or writs 
to any Government, authority or person may also be exercised by any High 
Court exercising jurisdiction in relation to the territories within which the 
cause of action, wholly or in part, arises for the exercise of such power, 
notwithstanding that the seat of such Government or authority or the 
residence of such person is not within those territories. 
(3) Where any party against whom an interim order, whether by way of 
injunction or stay or in any other manner, is made on, or in any 
proceedings relating to, a petition under clause (1), without — 
(a) 
furnishing to such party copies of such petition and all 
documents in support of the plea for such interim order; and 
(b) 
giving such parry an opportunity of being heard. makes an 
application to the High Court for the vacation of such order and 
furnishes a copy of such application to the party in whose favour

It was submitted, that the above original jurisdiction vested in the High Court to 
issue prerogative writs, has been shown to have been consciously preserved, for 
matters pertaining to levy and collection of tax. It was also submitted, that the 
enactment of the NTT Act has the clear and explicit effect, of excluding the 
jurisdiction of the High Courts. This was sought to be explained by indicating, 
 
that the jurisdiction to adjudicate appeals, traditionally determined by 
jurisdictional High Courts, from orders passed by Appellate Tribunals under the 
Income Tax Act, the Customs Act and the Excise Act (all taxing legislations) have 
been taken out of the purview of the High Courts, and have been vested with the 
NH, by the NH Act. It was further submitted, that even the jurisdiction vested 
in High Courts under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, has been 
practically done away with. In this behalf the explanation was, that by providing 
for an appellate remedy against an order passed by the NTT, directly to the 
Supreme Court, the above original jurisdiction of the High Courts, had practically 
been frustrated and effectively neutralized. It is pointed out, that the curtailment 
of the jurisdiction of the High Courtg under Articles 226 and 227 of the 
Constitution, must be viewed as submission, distinct and separate from the one 
emerging out of the substitution of, the jurisdiction of the High Courts under 
Section 260A of the Income Tax Act, 1961, Section 130 of the Customs Act, and 
Section 35G of the Excise Act. Whilst the former contention is based on a clear 
constitutional right, the submission based on the provisions of the taxing statutes. 
33

emerges from a well accepted constitutional convention, coupled with the clear 
intent expressed in the proviso to Article 225 of the Constitution. 
22. 	
In order to support the second contention advanced by the petitioners, he 
following decisions were relied upon: 
(i) 	
Reliance was first of all, placed on the decision of the Privy Council in 
Hinds v. The Queen Director of Public Prosecutions V. Jackson Attorney General 
of Jamaica (Intervener), 1976 All ER Vol. (1) 353. The factual/legal position 
which arose for determination in the cited case pertained to the Gun Court Act, 
1974. enacted by the Parliament of Jamaica. The aforesaid enactment was 
made, without following the special procedure prescribed by Section 49 of the 
Constitution of Jamaica (to alter the provisions of the Constitution of Jamaica). 
The Gun Court Act, 1974, had the effect of creating a new Court — "the Gun 
Court', to sit in three different kinds of divisions: A Resident Magistrate's Division, 
a Full Court Division and a Circuit Court Division. One or the other of these 
divisions, was conferred with the jurisdiction to try, different categories of 
offenders of criminal offences. Prior to the passing of the Act, and at the date of 
coming into force of the Constitution, these offences were cognizable only before 
a Resident Magistrate's Court, or before the Circuit Court of the Supreme Court 
of Jamaica. The Gun Court Act, 1974, also laid down the procedure to be 
followed (in each of the divisions). For certain specified offences relating to 
unauthorized possession, acquisition or disposal of firearms and ammunition, 
"the Gun Court" was required to mandatorily impose a sentence of detention on 
hard labour. A detenue could only be discharged, at the direction of the 
34 
Page 34 
135-- 
 
Governor-General, acting in accordance with the advice of the Review Board. 
The Review Board was a non-judicial body under the Gun Court Act, 1974. 
Lord Diplock while recording the majority view in Hinds case (supra), 
observed as under:- 	
In seeking to apply to the interpretation of the Constitution of 
Jamaica what has been said in particular cases about other constitutions, 
care must be taken to distinguish between judicial reasoning which 
depended on the express words used in the particular constitution under 
consideration and reasoning which depended on what, though not 
expressed, is nonetheless a necessary implication from the subject-matter 
and structure of the constitution and the circumstances in which it had 
been made. Such caution is particularly necessary in cases dealing with a 
federal constitution in which the question immediately in issue may have 
depended in part on the separation of the judicial power from the 
legislative or executive power of the federation or of one of its component 
states and in part upon the division of judicial power between the 
federation and a component state. 
Nevertheless all these constitutions have two things in common  
which have an important bearing on their interpretation. They differ  
fundamentally in their nature from ordinary legislation passed by the  
parliament of a sovereign state. They embody what is in substance an  
agreement reached between representatives of the various shades of  
political opinion in the state as to the structure of the organs of government  
through which the plenitude of the sovereign power of the state is to be  
exercised in future. All of them were negotiated as well as drafted by  
persons nurtured in the tradition of that branch of the common law of  
England that is concerned with public law and familiar in particularvith the 
basic concept of separation of legislative executive and judicial power as it  
had been developed in the unwritten constitution of the United Kingdom.  
As to their subject-matter the peoples for whom new constitutions were  
being provided were already living under a system of public law in which  
the local institutions through which government was carried on the  
legislature the executive and the courts reflected the same basic conce  
The new constitutions particularly in the case of unitary states were  
evolutionary not revolutionary. They provided for continuity of government  
through successor institutions legislative executive and judicial of which  
the members were to be selected in a different way. but each institution  
was to exercise powers which although enlarged remained of a similar  
character to those that had been exercised by the corresponding institution 
 
that it had replaced.  
35 
Page 35 
136 
Because of this a great deal can be and in drafting practice often is  
left to necessary implication from the adoption in the new constitution of a  
governmental structure which makes provision for a legislature an  
executive and a iudicature. It is taken for granted that the basic principle of  
separation of powers will apply to the exercise of their respective functions  
by these three organs of government. Thus the constitution does not  
normally contain any express prohibition on the exercise of legislative  
powers by the executive or of iudicial powers by either the executive or the  
legislature. As respects the iudicature particularly if it is intended that the  
previously existing courts shall continue to function the constitution itself  
may even omit any express provision conferring iudicial power upon the  
judicature. Nevertheless it is well established as a rule of construction  
applicable to constitutional instruments under which this governmental  
structure is adopted that the absence of express words to that effect does  
not prevent the legislative the executive and the iudicial powers of the new 
 
state being exercisable exclusively by the legislature by the executive and  
by the iudicature respectively. To seek to apply to constitutional 
instruments the canons of construction applicable to ordinary legislation in 
the fields of substantive criminal or civil law would, in their Lordships' view, 
be misleading - particularly those applicable to taxing statutes as to which 
it is a well-established principle that express words are needed to impose a 
charge on the subject. 
In the result there can be discerned in all those constitutions which 
have their origin in an Act of the Imperial Parliament at Westminster or in 
an Order in Council, a common pattern and style of draftsmanship which 
may conveniently be described as 'the Westminster model.' 
Before turning to those express provisions of the Constitution of 
Jamaica upon which the appellants rely in these appeals, their 
Lordships will make some general observations about the interpretation of 
constitutions which follow the Westminster model. 
All Constitutions on the Westminster model deal under separate  
Chapter headings with the legislature the executive and the iudicature.  
The Chapter dealing with the iudicature invariably contains provisions  
dealing with the method of appointment and security of tenure of the  
members of the iudiciary which are designed to assure to them a degree of 
 
independence from the other two branches of government. It may, as in 
the case of the Constitution of Ceylon, contain nothing more. To the extent 
to which the Constitution itself is silent as to the distribution of the plenitude 
of judicial power between venous courts it is implicit that it shall continue to 
be distributed between and exercised by the courts that were already in 
existence when the new Constitution came into force; but the legislature, in 
the exercise of its power to make laws for the 'peace, order and good 
government' of the state, may provide for the establishment of new courts 
and for the transfer to them of the whole or part of the jurisdiction 
previously exercisable by an existing court. What. however is implicit in  
36 
Page 36 
-137- 
 
the very structure of a Constitution on the Westminster model is that  
judicial power however it be distributed from time to time between various  
courts is to continue to be vested in persons appointed to hold judicial  
office in the manner and on the terms laid down in the Chapter dealincy
Lj .11-1 
the judicature. even though this is not expressly stated in the  
Constitution (Livanage v. R. 119661 1 All ER 650 at 658 119671 A.0 259 at 
287. 288). 
The more recent constitutions on the Westminster model, unlike 
their earlier prototypes, include a Chapter dealing with fundamental rights 
and freedoms. The provisions of this Chapter form part of the substantive 
law of the state and until amended by whatever special procedure is laid 
down in the Constitution for this purpose, impose a fetter upon the exercise 
by the legislature, the executive and the judiciary of the plenitude of their 
respective powers. The remaining Chapters of the Constitutions are 
primarily concerned not with the legislature, the executive and the 
judicature as abstractions, but with the persons who shall be entitled 
collectively or individually to exercise the plenitude of legislative, executive 
or judicial powers - their qualifications for legislative, executive or judicial 
office, the methods of selecting them, their tenure of office, the procedure 
to be followed where powers are conferred on a class of persons acting 
collectively and the majorities required for the exercise of those powers. 
Thus where a constitution on the Westminster model speaks of a  
• articular 'court' alread 
in existence when the Constitution comes into 
force it uses this expression as a collective description of all those  
individual iudoes who whether sitting alone or with other iudoes or with a  
jury. are entitled to exercise the iurisdiction exercised by that court before  
the Constitution came into force. Any express provision in the constitution  
for the appointment or security of tenure of judges of that court will apply to  
all individual Fudges subsequently appointed to exercise an analogous  
jurisdiction. whatever other name may be given to the 'court' in which they  
sit (Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada) 119251  
A.C. 750. 
Where, under a constitution on the Westminster model, a law is 
made by the Parliament which purports to confer jurisdiction on a court 
described by a new name, the question whether the law conflicts with the 
provisions of the constitution dealing with the exercise of the judicial power 
does not depend upon the label (in the instant case The Gun Court) which 
the Parliament attaches to the judges when exercising the jurisdiction 
conferred on them by the law whose constitutionality is impugned. It is the 
substance of the law that must be regarded, not the form. What is the 
nature of the jurisdiction to be exercised by the judges who are to compose 
the court to which the new label is attached? Does the method of their 
appointment and the security of their tenure conform to the requirements of 
the constitution applicable to judges who, at the time the constitution came 
into force, exercised jurisdiction of that nature? (Attorney-General for  
37 
Page 37 
Australia v. R. and Boilermakers' Society of Australia 119571 A C 288 
 
309-310).

....So in deciding whether any provisions of a law passed by the 
Parliament of Jamaica as an ordinary law are inconsistent with the 
Constitution of Jamaica, neither the courts of Jamaica nor their Lordships' 
Board are concerned with the propriety or expediency of the law 
impugned. They are concerned solely with whether those provisions, 
however reasonable and expedient, are of such a character that they 
conflict with an entrenched provision of the Constitution and so can be 
validly passed only after the Constitution has been amended by the 
method laid down by it for altering that entrenched provision." 
The question examined by the Privy Council in the background of the 
factual/legal position expressed above, was recorded in the following words:- 
"The attack on the constitutionality of the Full Court Division of the Gun 
Court may be based on two grounds. The first is that the Gun Court Act 
1974 purports to confer on a court consisting of persons qualified and 
appointed as resident magistrates a jurisdiction which under the provisions 
of Chapter VII of the Constitution is exercisable only by a person qualified 
and appointed as a judge of the Supreme Court. The second ground is 
much less fundamental. It need only be mentioned briefly, for it arises only 
if the first ground fails. It is that even if the conferment of jurisdiction on a 
Full Court Division consisting of three resident magistrates is valid section  
112 of the Constitution requires that any assignment of a resident 
magistrate to sit in that division should be made by the Governor-General 
acting on the recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission and not 
by the Chief Justice as the 1974 Act provides: 
The question was dealt with, by opining as under:- 
"Chapter VII of the Constitution, The Judicature.' was in their 
Lordships' view intended to deal with the appointment and security of 
enure of all persons holding any salaried office by virtue of which they are 
entitled to exercise civil or criminal jurisdiction in Jamaica. For this purpose 
hey are divided into two categories: (i) a higher judiciary, cons sting of 
udges of the Supreme Court and judges of the Court of Appeal, and (ii) a 
awer judiciary, consisting of those described in section 112 (2) , viz 
'... Resident magistrate, judge of the Traffic Court, Registrar of the 
Supreme Court, Registrar of the Court of Appeal and such other 
offices connected with the courts of Jamaica as, subject to the 
provisions of this Constitution, may be prescribed by Parliament.' 
Apart from the offices of judge and registrar of the Court of Appeal 
which were new, these two categories embraced all salaried members of 
38 
Page 38 
/3?- 
the judiciary who exercised civil or criminal jurisdiction in Jamaica at the 
date when the Constitution came into force. A minor jurisdiction, 
particularly in relation to juveniles, was exercised by justices of the peace 
but, as in England, they sat part-time only, were unpaid and were not 
required to possess any professional qualification. 
Common to both categories. with the exception of the Chief Justice  
of the Supreme Court and the President of the Court of Appeal is the  
recuirement under the Constitution that they should be appointed by the  
Governor-General on the recommendation of the Judicial Service  
Commission - a body established under section 111 whose composition is  
different from that of the Public Service Commission and consists of  
•ersons like] to be •ualified to a sess the fitness of a candidate for 
 
udicial office.  
The distinction between the higher judiciary and the lower judiciary is 
hat the former are given a greater degree of security of tenure than the 
atter. There is nothing in the Constitution to protect the lower judiciary 
against Parliament passing ordinary laws (a) abolishing their office (b) 
educing their salaries while they are in office or (c) providing that their 
appointments to judicial office shall be only for a short fixed term of years. 
Theft independence of the good-will of the political party which commands 
a bare majority in the Parliament is thus not fully assured. The only 
protection that is assured to them by section 112 is that they cannot be 
removed or disciplined except on the recommendation of the Judicial 
Service Commission with a right of appeal to the Privy Council. This last is 
a local body established under section 82 of the Constitution whose 
members are appointed by the Governor-General after consultation with 
the Prime Minister and hold office for a period not exceeding three years. 
 
In contrast to this judges of the Supreme Court and of the Court of  
Appeal are given a more firmly rooted security of tenure. They are  
protected by entrenched provisions of the Constitution against Parliament  
passing ordinary laws (a) abolishing their office (b) reducing their salaries  
while in office or (c) providing that their tenure of office shall end before  
they attain the age of 65 years They are not subiect to any disciplinary  
control while in office. They can only be removed from office on the advice  
of the Judicial Committee of Her Maiesty's Privy Council in the United  
Kingdom given on a reference made on the recommendation of a tribunal  
of inquiry consisting of persons who hold or have held high iudicial office in  
some part of the Commonwealth. 
The manifest intention of these provisions is that all those who hold  
any salaried iudicial office in Jamaica shall be appointed on the  
recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission and that their  
independence from political pressure by Parliament or by the Executive in  
the exercise of their ludicial functions shall be assured by granting to them  
such degree of security of tenure in their office as is iustified by the  
importance of the jurisdiction that they exercise. A clear distinction is 
39 
Page 39 
--RIB RI 
drawn between the security of tenure appropriate to those judges who 
exercise the jurisdiction of the higher judiciary and that appropriate to 
those judges who exercise the jurisdiction of the lower judiciary.

do• he am) jar words used b Viscount  Simonds in Attorne -General of 
Australia R. and Boiler akers' Socie of Austr lia 1957 A.C. 288 309-
310 it would make a mocke of the Constitution if Par ie ent could

offices named in Chaster V I of the Constitution to ho ders of new 'udicia 
affces to which some different name was attached and to • rovide tha 
•er ons ho d' • the new'udicial offices should not be 
• • ointed in the 
manner and on the ter 	
•rescribed in Chaster VII fort e a ointment of 
members of the judicature. If this were the case there would be nothing to 
prevent Parliament from transferring the whole of the judicial power of 
Jamaica (with two minor exceptions referred to below) to bodies compot be 
osed 
of persons who, not being members of the Judicature,' would n  
enttled to the protection of Chapter VII at all. 
What the Attorney-General does not concede is that Parliament is 
prohibited by Chapter VII from transferring to a court composed of duly 
appointed members of the lower judiciary jurisdiction which, at the time the 
Constitution came into force, was exercisable only by a court composed of 
duly appointed meinbe s of the higher judiciary. 
In their Lordships' view sn1 1ffi
a 	
of the Constitution makes it 
apparent that in provid ng in secsL03  Cl) 
 that 'There shall be a Court of 
Appeal for Jamaica ...' the draftsman treated this form of words as carrying 
with it by necessary implication that the judges of the court required to be 
Page 40 
6-- I 9/ — 
established under section 103 should exercise an appellate jurisdiction in 
all substantial civil cases and in all serious criminal cases; and that the 
words that follow, viz. 'which shall have such jurisdiction and powers as 
may be conferred upon it by this Constitution or any other law,' do not 
entitle Parliament by an ordinary law to deprive the Court of Appeal of a 
significant part of such appellate jurisdiction or to confer it on judges who 
do not enjoy the security of tenure which the Constitution guarantees to 
judges of the Court of Appeal. Section 110 (” of the Constitution which 
grants to litigants wide rights of appeal to Her Majesty in Council but only 
from 'decisions of the Court of Appeal,' clearly proceeds on this 
assumption as to the effect of section 103, Section 110 would be rendered 
nugatory if its wide appellate jurisdiction could be removed from the Court 
of Appeal by an ordinary law without amendment of the Constitution. 
Their Lordships see no reason why a similar implication should not 
be drawn from the corresponding words of section 97. The Court of Appeal 
of Jamaica was a new court established under the Judicature (Appellate 
Jurisdiction) Law 1962 , which came into force one day before the 
Constitution, viz. on 5 August, 1962. The Supreme Court of Jamaica had 
existed under that title since 1880. In the judges of that court there had 
been vested all that jurisdiction in Jamaica which in their Lordships' view 
was characteristic of a court to which in 1962 the description 'a Supreme 
Court' was appropriate in a hierarchy of courts which was to include a 
separate 'Court of Appeal.' The three kinds of jurisdiction that are 
characteristic of a Supreme Court where appellate jurisdiction is vested in 
a separate court are: (1) unlimited original jurisdiction in all substantial civil 
cases; (2) unlimited original jurisdiction in all serious criminal offences; (3) 
supervisory jurisdiction over the proceedings of inferior courts (viz. of the 
kind which owes its origin to the prerogative writs of certiorari, mandamus 
and prohibition). 
That section 97 (1) of the Constitution was intended to preserve in 
Jamaica a Supreme Court exercising this characteristic jurisdiction is, in 
their Lordships' view, supported by the provision in section 13 (1) of the  
Jamaica (Constitution) Order in Council 1962 that 'the Supreme Court in 
existence immediately before the commencement of this Order shall be the 
Supreme Court for the purposes of the Constitution.' This is made an 
entrenched provision of the Constitution itself by section 21 (11 of the 
Order in Council. and confirms that the kind of court referred to in the 
words 'There shall be a Supreme Court for Jamaica' was a court which 
would exercise in Jamaica the three kinds of jurisdiction characteristic of a 
Supreme Court that have been indicated above. 
If, as contended by the Attorney-General, the words italicised above 
in section 97 (1) entitled Parliament by an ordinary law to strip the 
Supreme Court of all jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases other than that 
expressly conferred upon it by section 25 and section 44, what would be 
left would be a court of such limited jurisdiction that the label 'Supreme 
41 
Page 41 
Court' would 
would be a false description', so too if all its jurisdiction (with those 
two exceptions) were exercisable concurrently by other courts composed 
of members of the lower judiciary. But more important, for this is the 
substance of the matter, the individual citizen could be deprived of the 
safeguard, which the makers of the Constitution regarded as necessary, of 
having important questions affecting his civil or criminal responsibilities 
determined by a court, however named, composed of judges whose 
independence from all local pressure by Parliament or by the executive 
was guaranteed by a security of tenure more absolute than that provided 
by the Constitution for judges of inferior courts. 
Their Lordships therefore are unable to accept that the words in  
section 97 I'. u•on which the Attorne -General relies entitle Parliament 
by an ordinary law to vest in a new court composed of members of  
the lower ludiciary a jurisdiction that forms a significant part of the unlimited  
civil criminal or supervisory turisdiction that is characteristic of a 'Supreme  
Court' and was exercised by the Supreme Court of Jamaica at the time 
 
when the Constitution came into force at any rate where such vesting is  
accompanied by ancillary provisions, such as those contained in section 6  
1 of the Gun Court Act 1974 which wou d have the conse•uence that all 
cases fa lin•within the 'urisdiction of the new court would in •ractice be 
heard and determined by it instead of by a court composed of tudges of the 
Su reme Court

In their Lordships' view the •revisions of the 1974 Act in so far as 
the •rovide for the estab ishment of a Ful Court Division of the Gun Court 
cons s 	
of three resident ma•istrates conflict with Chaster VII of the 
Constitution and are accordin•I void b virtue of section 2 
xxxx 	
xxxx 	
xxxx 
Thus Parliament, in the exercise of its legislative power, may make a 
law imposing limits upon the discretion of the judges who preside over the 
courts by whom offences against that law are tried to inflict on an individual 
offender a custodial sentence the length of which reflects the judge'sticu 
own 
assessment of the gravity of the offender's conduct in the particular 
circumstance of his case. What Pa ament cannot do 	
sistent with the 
se•aration of sowers. is to transfer from he 'udicia to an executive b d 
whose members are not a•ointed under Chaster VII of the Consfitution a 
discretion to det rmine the seven of t e •unishiment to be inf icted 
an individual member of a class of offenders. Whilst none would su 
that a Review Board com ased as is •rovided in section 22 of the Gun 
Court Act 1974 would not perform its duties responsibly and impartially the 
fact remains that the rna'ori of its members are no •ersons •ualified b 
the Constitution to exercise 'udicial sowers. A breach of a constitutional 
restriction is not excused by the good intentions with which the legislative  
sower has been exceeded b the •articular law. If consistentl with the 
Constitution it is •ermissible for the Parliament to confer the discretion to 
42 
Page 42 
determine the length of custodial sentences for criminal offences on a body  
composed as the Review Board is it would be equally permissible to a  
less well-intentioned Parliament to confer the same discretion on any other  
person or body of persons not qualified to exercise judicial powers and in  
this way without any amendment of the Constitution. to open the door to  
the exercise of arbitrary power by the executive in the whole field of  
criminal law. 
xxxx 	
xxxx 	
xxxx 
Their Lordships would hold that the provisions of section 8 of the Act  
relating to the mandatory sentence of detention during the Gisfertlor-
General's pleasure and the provisions of section 22 relating to the Review  
Board are a law made after the coming into force of the Constitution which  
is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution relating to the 
separation of powers. They are accordingly void by virtue of section 2 of  
the Constitution."

In the same sequence, learned counsel for the petitioners invited our 
attention to Liyanage v. Reginam, (1966) 1 All ER 650. It is first necessary to 
record the factual/legal matrix, in the cited judgment. All the 11 appellants in the 
matter before the Privy Council, were charged with offences arising out of an 
abortive coup d'e'tat on 27.1.1962. The factum of the said coup d'e'tat, was set 
out in a White Paper issued by the Government of Ceylon on 13.2.1962. The 
White Paper gave the names of 13 alleged conspirators including the appellants. 
The White Paper concluded by observing, that a deterrent punishment of a 
severe character ought to be imposed, on all those who were guilty. On 
16.3.1962, the Criminal Law (Special Provisions) Act, No. 1 of 1962 was passed. 
It was given retrospective effect from 1.1.1962. It was limited in operation to 
those who were accused of offences against the State, on or around 27.1.1962. 
The above Act legalized imprisonment of the appellants, while they were awaiting 
trial. It modified a section of the Penal Code, so as to enact ex post facto. a new 
offence, to meet the circumstance of the abortive coup. It altered ex post facto, 
43 
Page 43 
the law of evidence, regarding settlements made by an accused, while in 
custody. It enacted a minimum punishment, accompanied by forfeiture of 
property, for the offences for which the appellants were tried. Under Section 
440A of the Criminal Procedure Code, trial in case of sedition, could be directed 
to be before three judges without a jury. The instant provision was amended by 
the above Act, so as to extend the same, to the offences for which the appellants 
were charged. Under Section 9 of the above Act, the Minister of Justice was 
empowered to nominate the three judges. In exercise of his powers under 
Section 9, the Minister of Justice had nominated three judges, to try the 
appellants without a jury. The Supreme Court upheld the objection raised by the 
appellants, that Section 9 was ultra vires the Constitution of Ceylon, and that, the 
nomination was invalid. Thereafter, the Criminal Law Act, No, 31 of 1962 was 
passed. It repealed Section 9 of the earlier Act. It amended the power of 
nomination, in that, the power was conferred on the Chief Justice. On appeal by 
the appellants, against the conviction and sentence from their trial before a Court 
of three judges nominated under the Act, it was held, that the Criminal Law 
(Special Provisions) Act, No. 1 of 1962, as well as, the Criminal Law Act, No. 31 
of 1962, were invalid for the two reasons. Firstly, under the Constitution of 
Ceylon, there was a separation of powers. The power of the judicature, while the 
Constitution stood, could not be usurped or infringed by the executive or the 
legislature. Secondly, the Criminal Law (Special Provisions) Act, No. 1 of 1962, 
as well as, the Criminal Law Act, No. 31 of 1962 were aimed at individuals 
concerned in an abortive coup, and were not legislation effecting criminal law of 
44 
Page 44 
- 
general application. Although not every enactment ad hominem, and ex post 
facto, necessarily infringed the judicial power, yet there was such infringement in 
the present case, by the above two Acts. In addition to the above conclusions, it 
was also held, that the joint effect of the Ceylon Constitution Order in Council 
1946, and the Ceylon Independence Act, 1947, was intended to, and resulted in, 
giving the Ceylon Parliament, full legislative powers of an independent sovereign 
State. Consequently. the legislative power of the Ceylon Parliament, was not 
limited by inability to pass laws, which offended fundamental principles of justice. 
The Privy Council while examining the above controversy, rendered the following 
opinion:- 
"In Ceylon however the position was different. The change of sovereignty  
did not in itself produce any apparent change in the constituents or the  
functioning of the Judicature. So far as the courts were concerned their  
work continued unaffected by the new Constitution and the Ordinances  
under which they functioned remained in force. The iudicial system had  
been established in Ceylon by the Charter of Justice in 1833. Clause 4 of  
the Charter read- 
"And to provide for the administration of justice hereafter in Our said 
Island Our will and pleasure is and We do hereby direct that the  
entire administration of iustice. civil and criminal therein shall be  
vested exclusively in the courts erected and constituted by this Our  
Charter ... and it is Our pleasure and We hereby declare that it is  
not and shall not be competent to the Governor of Our said Island  
by any Law or Ordinance to be by him made with the advice of the  
Leaislafive Council thereof or otherwise howsoever to constitute or  
establish any court for the administration of iustice in any case civil  
or criminal save as hereinafter is expressly saved and provided." 
Clause 5 established the Supreme Court and clause 6 a Chief Justice and 
two puisne judges. Clause 7 gave the Governor powers of appointing their 
successors. There follow many clauses with regard to administrative, 
procedural and jurisdictional matters. Some half a century later Ordinances 
(in particular the Courts Ordinance) continued the jurisdiction and 
procedure of the courts. Thereunder the courts have functioned 
continuously up to the present day.

t" 
The Constitution is significantly divided into parts - 'Fart 2 The 
Governor-General," 'Part 3 The Legislature," "Pal 4 Delimitation of 
Electoral Districts," "Part 5 The Executive," "Part 6 The Judicature," 'Part 7 
The Public Service," "Part 8 Finance And although no express mention is 
made of vesting in the judicature the judicial power which it already had 
and was wielding in its daily process under the Courts Ordinance, there is 
provision under Part 6 for the appointment of judges by a Judicial Service 
Commission which shall not contain a member of either House, but shall 
be composed of the Chief Justice and a judge and another person who is 
or shall have been a judge. Any attempt to influence any decision of the 
Commission is made a criminal offence. There is also provision that judges 
shall not be removable except by the Governor-General on an address of 
both Houses. 
These provisions manifest an intention to secure in the iudiciary a  
freedom from political legislative and executive control. They are wholly  
appropriate in a Constitution which intends that iudicial power shall be  
vested only in the judicature. They would be inappropriate in a Constitution  
by which it was intended that iudicial power should be shared by the  
executive or the legislature. The Constitution's silence as to the vesting of  
judicial power is consistent with its remaining where it had lain for more  
than a century. in the hands of the judicature. It is not consistent with any  
intention that henceforth it should pass to or be shared by the executive or  
the legislature.  
Counsel for the appellants succinctly summarises his attack on the 
Acts in question as follows. The first Act was wholly bad in that it was a 
special direction to the judiciary as to the trial of particular prisoners who 
were identifiable (in view of the White Paper) and charged with particular 
offences on a particular occasion. The pith and substance of both Acts was 
a legislative plan ex post facto to secure the conviction and enhance the 
punishment of those particular individuals. It legalised their imprisonment 
while they were awaiting trial. It made admissible their statements 
inadmissibly obtained during that period. It altered the fundamental law of 
evidence so as to facilitate their conviction. and finally it altered ex post 
facto the punishment to be imposed on them. 
In their Lordships' view that cogent summary fairly describes the 
effect of the Acts. As has been indicated already, legislation ad hominem 
which is thus directed to the course of particular proceedings may not 
always amount to an interference with the functions of the judiciary. But in 
the present case their Lordships have no doubt that there was such 
interference. that it was not only the likely but the intended effect of the 
impugned enactments: and that it is fatal to their validity. The true nature 
and purpose of these enactments are revealed by their conjoint impact on 
the specific proceedings in respect of which they were designed, and they 
take their colour, in particular, from the alterations they purported to make 
as to their ultimate objective, the punishment of those convicted. These 
46 
Page 46 
-1W- 
alterations constituted a grave and deliberate incursion into the judicial 
sphere. Quite bluntly, their aim was to ensure that the judges in dealing 
with these particular persons on these particular charges were deprived of 
their normal discretion as respects appropriate sentences. They were 
compelled to sentence each offender on conviction to not less than ten 
years' imprisonment, and compelled to order confiscation of his 
possessions, even though his part in the conspiracy might have been 
trivial. 
The trial court concluded its long and careful judgment with these 
words ((1965), 67 CNLR at p. 424): 
Out we must draw attention to the fact that the Act of 1962 radically 
altered ex post facto the punishment to which the defendants are 
endered liable. The Act removed the discretion of the court as to the 
period of the sentence to be imposed, and compels the court to 
impose a term of 10 years' imprisonment. although we would have 
wished to differentiate in the matter of sentence between those who 
organised the conspiracy and those who were induced to join it. It 
also imposes a compulsory forfeiture of property. These 
amendments were not merely retroactive: they were also ad hoc, 
applicable only to the conspiracy which was the subject of the 
charges we have tried. We are unable to understand this 
discrimination. To the courts, which must be free of political bias, 
treasonable offences are equally heinous, whatever be the 
complexion of the Government in power or whoever be the 
offenders." 
Their Lordships sympathise with that protest and wholly agree with 
it. 
One might fairly apply to these Acts the words of Chase J., in the 
Supreme Court of the United States in Calder v. Bull: "These acts were 
legislative judgments; and an exercise of judicial power." 
Blackstone in his Commentaries, Vol. I (41h  Edition), p. 44, wrote: 
"Therefore a particular act of the legislature to confiscate the goods 
of Titius, or to attaint him of high treason does not enter into the idea 
of a municipal law: for the operation of this act is spent upon Titius 
only and has no relation to the community in General: it is rather a 
sentence than a law." 
If such Acts as these were valid the judicial power could be wholly 
absorbed by the legislature and taken out of the hands of the judges. It is 
appreciated that the legislature had no such general intention. It was beset 
by a grave situation and it took grave measures to deal with it, thinking, 
one must presume, that it had power to do so and was acting rightly; But 
that consideration is irrelevant, and gives no validity to acts which infringe 
the Constitution. What is done once, if it be allowed, may be done again 
and in a lesser crisis and less serious circumstances; and thus judicial 
power may be eroded. Such an erosion is contrary to the clear intention of 
47 
Page 47 
-198- 
 
the Constitution. In their Lordships' view the Acts were ultra vires and 
invalid. 
xxx 	
xxx 	
xxx 
It was agreed between the parties that if the Acts were ultra vires  
and invalid. the convictions cannot stand. Their Lordships have therefore  
humbly advised Her Maiestv that this appeal should be allowed and that  
the convictions should be Quashed." 
(iii) 	
Reference was then made to Director of Public Prosecutions of Jamaica v. 
Mollison, (2003) 2 AC 411. The factual controversy which led to the above cited 
decision of the Privy Council may be noticed. On 16.3.1994, when Kurt Mollison 
was merely 16 years old, he committed a murder in furtherance of a robbery. His 
offence was described as a "capital murder", under the law of Jamaica. After his 
trial, he was convicted on 21.4.1997, when he was 19 years old. On 25.4.997, 
he was sentenced under Section 29(1) of the Juveniles Act, 1951, to be detained 
during the Governor-General's pleasure. On 16.2.2000, although the Court of 
Appeal refused his prayer for leave to appeal against his conviction, it agreed to 
examine his contention, whether the sentence imposed on him was compatible 
with the provisions of the Constitution of Jamaica. The Court of Appeal accepted 
his contention. The sentence of detention, during the Governor-General's 
pleasure, was set aside. In its place, he was sentenced to life imprisonment, with 
the recommendation that, he be not considered for parole till he had served a 
term of 20 years' imprisonment. In the controversy which came up for 
consideration before the Privy Council, there were two main issues. Firstly, 
whether the sentence of detention during the Governor-General's pleasure 
-authorized by Section 29(1), was a power exercised by him in his executive 
capacity. And secondly, whether the power to determine the measure for 
48 
Page 98 
punishment to be inflicted on an offender, is compatible with the Constitution. 
The Privy Council, while examining the controversy, opined as under:- 
"Section 29 of the Juveniles Act 1951 
[3] 
Section 3 of the Offences against the Person Act 1864, as amended, 
provides that every person convicted of capital murder shall be sentenced 
to death. But special provision has been made for those who commit this 
crime when aged under 18. Following a number of amendments made 
pursuant to section 4 of the Jamaica (Constitution) Order in Council 1962 
(SI 1962/1500), section 29 of the Juveniles Act 1951 now provides, so far 
as material to the main issue in this appeal, as follows: 
"(1) Sentence of death shall not be pronounced on or recorded 
against a person convicted of an offence if it appears to the court 
that at the time when the offence was committed he was under the 
age of 18 years, but in place thereof the court shall sentence him to 
be detained during Her Majesty's pleasure, and, if so sentenced, he 
shall, notwithstanding anything in the other provisions of this Law, be 
liable to be detained in such place (including, save in the case of a 
child, an adult correctional centre) and under such conditions as the 
Minister may direct, and while so detained shall be deemed to be in 
legal custody. 
(4) The Governor-General may release on licence any person 
detained under subsection (1) or (3) of this section. Such licence 
shall be in such form and contain such conditions as the Governor-
General may direct, and may at any time be revoked or varied by the 
Governor-General. Where such licence is revoked the person to 
whom it relates shall return forthwith to such place as the Governor-
General may direct, and if he fails to do so may be arrested by any 
constable without warrant and taken to such place." 
[4] 
Section 29 as originally enacted was amended in 1964 to substitute 
"Minister" for ''Governor in subsection (1) and "Governor General" 
for "Governor" in each of the four references originally made to the 
Governor in subsection (4). In 1975 subsection (1) was further amended to 
make plain, reversing the effect of Baker v The Queen [1975] AC 774  
[1975] 3 All ER 55, that the statutory prohibition on pronouncement of the 
death sentence applied to those appearing to be aged under 18 at the time 
when they had committed the offence, not at the time of sentence. In 1985, 
the reference to "an adult correctional centre" was substituted for the 
previous reference to "a prison". The enacted reference to "Her Majesty's 
pleasure has not, however, been amended, no doubt because section 
68(2) of the Constitution of Jamaica provides that the executive authority of 
Jamaica may be exercised on behalf of Her Majesty by the Governor-
General. In recognition of this constitutional reality, it appears to be the 
practice where section 29(1) applies, as was done in this case, to call the 
49 
Pace 49 
sentence one of detention during the Governor-Generals pleasure, and in 
this opinion that usage will be adopted.

The Constitution

xxx 
The first question: is section 29 compatible with the Constitution of 
Jamaica? 
[11] Both the Director and the Solicitor-General, who appeared with him, 
accepted at the hearing that, subject to their argument based on section 
26(8) of the Constitution, section 29 of the Juveniles Act 1951 infringes the 
rights guaranteed by, and so is inconsistent with, sections 15(1)(b) and 
20(1) of the Constitution. Given this concession, rightly made, it is 
unnecessary to do more than note the reason for it. A person detained  
dtjuirig
i  the Governor-General's pleasure is deprived of his personal liberty  
not in execution of the sentence or order of a court but at the discretion of  
the executive Such a person is not afforded a fair hearing by an  
independent and impartial court because the sentencing of a criminal  
defendant is Dart of the hearing and in cases such as the present sentence  
is effectively passed by the executive and not by a court independent of  
the executive.  
X)0(

XXX 
[13] 	
It does indeed appear that the sentencing provisions under 
challenge in the Hinds case were held to be unconstitutional not because 
of their repugnancy to any of the rights guaranteed by sections in Chapter 
III of the Consfitufion but because of their incompatibility with a principle on 
which the Constitution itself was held to be founded. There appears to be 
no reason why (subject to the other arguments considered below) the 
reasoning in the Hindscase does not apply to the present case. It would no 
doubt be open to the Board to reject that reasoning, but it would be 
reluctant to depart from a decision which has stood unchallenged for 25 
years, the more so since the decision gives effect to a very important and 
salutary principle. Whatever overlap there may be under constitutions on 
the Westminster model between the exercise of executive and legislative 
powers, the separation between the exercise of judicial powers on the one 
hand and leg slative and executive powers on the other is total or 
effectively so. Such separation, based on the rule of law, was recently 
described by Lord Steyn as "a characteristic feature of democracies": R 
(Anderson) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2002] 4 All ER 
1089, [2002] 3 WLR 1800, at pp. 1821-1822, para 5 of the latter report. In 
the opinion of the Board, Mr Fitzgerald has made good his challenge to 
section 29 based on its incompatibility with the constitutional principle that 
judicial functions (such as sentencing) must be exercised by the judiciary 
and not by the executive. 
xxx

Page 50 
.....The nature and purpose of the sentence of detention during the 
Governor-General's pleasure are clear, as explained above. The only 
question is who should decide on the measure of punishment the detainee 
should suffer. Since the vice of section 29 is to entrust this decision to the 
executive instead of the judiciary, the necessary modification to ensure 
conformity with the Constitution is (as in  Browne v The Queen 120001 1 AC 
45) to substitute "the court's" for "Her Majesty's!' in subsection (1) and "the 
court" for each reference to "the Governor-General" in subsection (4)." 
(iv) Our attention was also invited to Harry Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal 
Opportunity Commission, (1995) 183 CLR 245. The instant judgment was 
rendered by the High Court of Australia. The factual controversy which led to the 
above determination is being narrated first. The plaintiff Harry Brandy was 
engaged as an officer of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. 
The third defendant John Bell was also an officer of the said Commission. The 
plaintiff and the third defendant continued to serve the Commission until the 
Commission itself ceased to exist. On 13.3.1990, John Bell lodged a complaint 
with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, wherein he alleged, 
verbal abuse and threatening behaviour on the part of Harry Brandy, while both 
were in the employment of the Commission. Thereafter, John Bell issued a 
notice under Section 24 of the Racial Discrimination Act, 1975. And accordingly, 
the Commissioner referred the complaint to the Commission. The power of the 
Commission, to hold an enquiry under the Racial Discrimination Act, 1975 
against Harry Brandy, was exercised by the second defendant. The second 
defendant had been appointed under Section 24 of the Racial Discrimination Act, 
1975, which empowered the Minister, to appoint a person to perform and 
discharge the functions of the Commissioner. The second defendant returned 
CI 
Page 51 
his findings under Section 25Z of the Racial Discrimination Act, 1975 on 
22.12.1993. The defendants complaint was found to be substantiated. In 
disposing of the controversy, the second defendant required Harry Brandy, the 
plaintiff, to do the following acts/course of conduct:- 
"(1) that the Plaintiff do apologise to the Third Defendant, the form of the 
apology being annexed to the determination: 
(2) that the Plaintiff do pay the sum of $2 500 to the Third Defendant by 
way of damages for the pain, humiliation, distress and loss of personal 
dignity suffered by the Third Defendant; 
(3) that ATSIC do take disciplinary action against the Plaintiff, in relation to 
the conduct which he perpetrated against the Third Defendant; 
(4) that ATSIC do apologise to the Third Defendant in relation to the 
handling of his complaint, the form of the apology being annexed to the 
determination; 
(5) that ATSIC do pay the sum of $10 000 to the Third Defendant by way 
of damages For the pain, humiliation, distress and loss of personal dignity 
suffered by the Third Defendant." 
In order to contest the determination rendered by the second defendant, Harry 
Brandy raised a challenge to the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act, 
1975. The challenge raised by him came to be formulated in the following 
words:- 
"In consequence of the amendments embodied in the Sex Discrimination 
and other Legislation Amendment Act 1992 and/or the Law and Justice 
Legislation Amendment Act 1993 as they affect the Racial Discrimination 
Act 1975 are any, and if so which, of the provisions of Part III of the Racial 
Discrimination Act invalid?" 
While adjudicating upon the matter, the High Court of Australia held as under:- 
"The plaintiff's challenge to the Act- 
Itplainfifts challenge to particular provisions of the Act is based  
upon the proposition that they provide for an exercise of ludicial power  
otherwise than in conformity with Chill of the Commonwealth Constitution  
in that the power is exercised by the Commission which is not a court  
established pursuant to s.71 and constituted in accordance with s.72 of the  
Constitution. The plaintiff further argues that the correctness of this 
52 
Page 52 
- I 5-3- 
 
proposition is not affected by the provisions for review by the Federal 
Court. 
xxx 	
xxx 	
)0(X 
21. Although many decision-making functions may take their character as 
an exercise of judicial, executive or legislative power from their legislative 
setfing, the character of the decision-maker and the nature of the decision-
making process, some decision-making functions are exclusive and 
inalienable exercises of judicial power (34 Reg. v. Davison (1954) 90 CLR 
at 368-370 per Dixon CJ and McTiernan J), As Dixon CJ and McCernan J 
observed in Reg. v. Davison (35 ibid. at 369) : 
"The truth is that the ascertainment of existing_fights by the iudicial  
determination of issues of fact or law falls exclusively within iudicial  
power so that the Parliament cannot confide the function to any  
person or body but a court constituted under ss.71 and 72 of the  
Constitution'. 
In that statement, the expression "judicial determination" means an 
authoritative determination by means of the judicial method, that is, an 
enforceable decision reached by applying the relevant principles of law to 
the facts as found. 
xxx 	
xxx 	
xxx 
25. 
Turning to the case before the Court, whatever might be the 
enforceability of a declaration that the plaintiff "do apologise", a declaration 
that the plaintiff "do pay the sum of $2 500" to the third defendant, once 
registered, attracts the operation of s.53 of the Federal Court of Australia 
Act 1976 (Cth). By that section, a person in whose favour a judgment is 
given is entitled to the same remedies for enforcement, by execution or 
otherwise, as are allowed by the laws of the State or Territory applicable. 
In the present case, this means New South Wales. Section 53 does not 
affect the operation of any provision made by or under any other Act or the 
Rules of Court for the execution and enforcement of judgments of the 
Court (40 s.53(2)) 
26. 
But s.25ZAB goes beyond providing the machinery for the  
enforcement of a determination. It purports to give a registered  
determination effect "as if it were an order made-by the Federal Court". A  
judicial order made by the Federal Court takes effect as an exercise of  
Commonwealth ludiciai power but a determination by the Commission is  
neither made nor registered in the exercise of iudicial power. An exercise  
of executive power by the Commission and the performance of an  
administrative function by the Registrar of the Federal Court simply cannot  
create an order which takes effect as an exercise of judicial power  
conversely an order which takes effect as an exercise of iudicial power  
cannot be made except after the making of a iudicial determination. Thus.  
s.25ZAB purports to prescribe what the Constitution does not permit: 
53 
Page 53 
(v) 	
Our attention was then invited to Reference Re Residential Tenancies Act, 
123 DLR (3d) 554. The factual matrix, in furtherance of which the above 
judgment was rendered by the Supreme Court of Canada, is as follows. The 
provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act, 1979 (Ontario), by which the 
Residential Tenancy Commission was empowered to order eviction of tenants, 
as also, could require landlords and tenants to comply with the obligations 
imposed under the said Act, were assailed, as offending against the limitation 
contained in Section 96 of the British North America Act, 1867, and therefore, 
ultra vires. In recording its conclusions on a similar analogy, as in the judgments 
noticed above, the Supreme Court of Canada observed as under: 
"Under s. 92(14) of the British North America Act, 1867, the 
provincial Legislatures have the legislative power in relation to the 
administration of justice in the Province. This is a wide power but subject to 
subtraction of ss. 96 to 100 in favour of the federal authority. Under s. 96  
the Governor General has the sole power to appoint the iudges of the  
Superior District and County Courts in each Province. Under s 97 the  
Judges who are to be appointed to the Superior District and County  
Courts are tc be selected from the respective bars of each Province. Under 
s 100 the Parliament of Canada is obliged to fix and provide for their  
salaries. Section 92(14) and ss. 96 to 100 represent one of the important  
compromises of the Fathers of Confederation. It N plain that what was  
sought to be achieved through this compromise and the intended effect of  
s. 96 would be destroyed if a Province could pass legislation creating a  
tribunal appoint members thereto. and then confer on the tribunal the  
jurisdiction of the Superior Courts. What was conceived as a strong  
constitutional base for national unity through a unitary iudicial system  
would be gravely undermined. Section 96 has thus come to be regarded 
as limiting provincial competence to make appointments to a tribunal 
exercising s. 96 judicial powers and therefore as implicitly limiting 
provincial competence to endow a provincial tribunal with such powers. 
IV 
The belief that any function which in 1867 had been vested in a s 96  
Court must forever remain in that Court reached its apogee in the  
judgment of Lord Atkin in Toronto Corporation v. York To Et. Al (1936) 1  
DLR 593 (1938) AC 415. (19381 1 VINVR 452 Describing s 96 as one of  
54 
Page 54 
the "three principal pillars in the temple of justice... not to be undermined'  
Lord Atkin held that the Ontario Municipal Board could not validly receive  
fiudicial authority". At the same time he held that the Municipal Board was  
in 'pith and substance' an administrative body. and the impugned 'iudicial  
functions' were severable from the administrative powers given to the  
Board under its enabling le isl lion. There was no analysis of the inter-
relationship between the judicial and administrative features of the 
legislative scheme; the assumption was that any attempt to confer a s. 96 
function on a provincially-appo'nted tribunal was ultra vires the Legislature. 
This sweeping interpretation of s. 96, with its accompanying restrictive 
view of provincial legislative authority under s. 92, was limited almost 
immediately by the judgment of this Court in the Reference to Adoption 
Act and Other Act, etc., (1933) 3 DLR 497. 71 CCC 110, (1938) SCR 398. 
 
Chief Justice Duff held that the jurisdiction of inferior Courts was not 'fixed 
forever as it stood at the date of Confederation". On his view, it was quite 
possible to remove jurisdiction from a Superior Court and vest it in a Court 
of summary jurisd don. The question which must be asked was whether 
"the jurisdiction conferred upon Magistrates under these statutes broadly 
conforms to a type of jur sdiction generally exercisable by Courts of 
summary jurisdicton rathe than the jurisdiction of Courts within the 
purview of s. 96" (p. 514). In the Adoption Reference, Duff C.J. looked to 
the historical practice in England and concluded that the jurisdiction 
conferred on Magistrates under the legislation before the Court in 
the Reference was analogous to the jurisdiction under the English Poor 
Laws, a jurisdiction which had belonged to courts of summary nature 
rather than to Superior Courts. On this basis, the legislation was upheld. 
The Adoption Reference represented a liberalization of the view of s. 96 
adopted by the Privy Council in Toronto v York at least in the context of a 
transfer of jurisdiction from a Superior Court to an inferior Court. 
The same process of liberalization this time in the context of a  
transfer of jurisdiction from a Superior Court to an administrative tribunal  
was initiated by the Priw Council in Labour Relations Board of 
Saskatchewan v. John East Iron Works, Limited, (1948) 4 DLR 673, (1949) 
AC 134, (1948) 2 VVVVR 1055 Lord Simonds proposed a two-fold test.  
The first limb of the test is to ask whether the board or tribunal exercises  
'judicial power". Lord Simonds did not propose a 'final' answer to the  
definition of "judicial power but he suggested at p. 680 DLR p. 149 AC  
that:  
conception of the judicial function is inseparably bound up  
with the idea of a suit between •arties whether between Crown and  
subject or between subject and subject, and that it is the duty of the  
Court to decide the issue between those parties with whom alone it  
rests to initiate or defend or compromise the proceedinql." 
If the answer to the initial question as to "iudicial power" is in the  
negative then that concludes the matter in favour of the provincial board.

If however the Dower is in fact a judicial power then it becomes  
necessary to ask a second question: in the exercise of that power is the  
tribunal analogous to a Superior District or County Court?

Step two involves consideration of the function within its institutional setting 
to determine whether the function itself is different when viewed in that  
settii2stdiga
l 	
rticular can the function still be considered to be a 'judicial'  
function? In addressing the issue, it is important to keep in mind the further 
statement by Rand J. in Dupont v. Inglis (at p. 424 DLR, p. 543 SCR) that 
'...it is the subject-matter rather than the apparatus of adjudication that is 
determinative". Thus the Question of whether any particular function is  
judicial' is not to be determined simply on the basis of procedural  
jappitsga. The primary issue is the nature of the question which the 
tribunal is called upon to decide. Where the tribunal is faced with a private 
dispute between parties, and is called upon to adjudicate through the 
application of a recognized body of rules in a manner consistent with 
fairness and impartiality, then, normally, it is acting in a judicial capacity'. 
To borrow the terminology of Professor Ronald Dworkin the judicial task  
involves questions of 'principle' that is consideration of the competing  
fights of individuals or groups. This can be contrasted with Questions of  
'policy involving competing views of the collective good of the community  
as a whole. (See Dworkin, Taking Rights Seriously (1977) at pp. 82-90 
(Duckworth)" 
A perusal of the conclusions recorded by the Supreme Court of Canada reveals, 
that the court evolved a three step test to determine the constitutional validity of a 
provision which vested adjudicatory functions in an administrative tribunal. The 
first step was determined in the light of the historical conditions existing in 1867, 
i.e. before the British North America Act, 1867 was enacted. The first step 
required a determination whether at the time of Confederation, the power or 
jurisdiction now vested in an administrative tribunal, was exercised through a 
Judicial court process. If the answer to the first step was in the negative, the 
constitution of the administrative tribunal would be valid. If historical evidence 
indicated, that the power, now vested with an administrative tribunal, was 
identical or analogous to a power exercised under Section 96 Courts at 
56 
Page 56 
- 151- 
Confederation, then the matter needed to be examined further. The second step 
was to determine, whether the power to be exercised by the administrative 
tribunal, should be considered as a judicial function. Insofar as the instant aspect 
of the matter is concerned, it was illustratively concluded, that where power 
vested in the administrative tribunal was in respect of adjudication of disputes 
between the parties, which required to be settled through an application of a 
recognized body of rules. in a manner consistent with fairness and impartiality, 
then the said power could be classified as judicial power/function. If, however, 
while applying the second step, the answer was in the negative, it was not 
necessary to proceed with the matter further, and the vesting of the power with 
the administrative tribunal should be considered as valid. If the power or 
jurisdiction is exercised in a judicial manner, then it is imperative to proceed to 
the third and final step. The third step contemplates analysis and review of the 
administrative tribunal's functions as a whole, and to examine the same in its 
entire institutional context. 	
It contemplated an examination of the inter- 
relationship between the administrative tribunal's judicial powers, and the other 
powers and jurisdiction conferred by the legislative enactment. If a judicial 
hearing is a must. whereafter a judgment was required to be rendered, the 
administrative tribunal would be deemed to be exercising jurisdiction which is 
ordinarily vested in a Court . It is after recording a finding in the affirmative on all 
the three steps, that it will be possible to conclude, whether judicial functions 
have been required to be exercised by the concerned administrative tribunal. 
Having examined the controversy in Reference Re Residential Tenancies Act 
57 
Page 57 
— I 5- s 
(supra), the Supreme Court of Canada arrived at the conclusion, that the 
Residential Tenancy Commission could have been authorized to grant orders for 
possession to a landlord or to grant orders for specific performance of a tenancy. 
23. Finally, learned counsel for the petitioners placed reliance on 
"Constitutional Law of Canada', by Peter W. Flagg (third edition, 1992, by 
Carswell, Thomson Professional Publishing) in order to assert, that even under 
Constitutions where the separation of power rule has not been explicitly provided 
for. there would be limitations in delegation of Court functions to tribunals. 
Relevant text on the subject, from the above treatise is being reproduced 
hereunder:- 
'7.3 Implications of Constitution's judicature sections 
(a) Separation of powers 
There is no general "separation of powers' in the Constitution Act, 
1867. The Act does not separate the legislative, executive and judicial 
functions and insist that each branch of government exercise only its  own' 
function. As between the legislative and executive branches, any 
separation of powers would make little sense in a system of responsible 
government; and it is clearly established that the Act does not call for any 
such separation. As between the judicial and the two political branches, 
there is likewise no general separation of powers. Either the Parliament or 
the Legislatures may by appropriate legislation confer non-judicial 
functions on the courts and (with one important exception, to be discussed) 
may confer judicial functions on bodies that are not courts. 
Each Canadian jurisdiction has conferred non-judicial functions on 
its courts, by enacting a statute which enables the government to refer a 
question of law to the courts for an advisory opinion. The rendering of 
advisory opinions to government is traditionally an "executive' function, 
performed by the law officers of the government. For that reason, the 
supreme Court of the United States and the High Court of Australia have 
refused to render advisory opinions, reasoning that a separation of powers 
doctrine in their Constitutions confines the courts to the traditional judicial 
function of adjudicating upon genuine controversies. But in the Reference 
Appeal (1912), A-G Ont. VA.-G. Can. (Reference Appeal) (1912) AC 571, 
the Privy Council refused to read any such limitation into Canada's 
Constitution. Their lordships upheld the federal reference statute, 
55 
Page 58 
apparently as a law in relation to the supreme court of Canada (s.101). 
The provincial reference statutes are also valid as laws in relation to the 
administration of justice in the province (s.92(14)). 
The conferral of judicial functions on bodies which are not courts is 
likewise subject to no general prohibition. However, here there is an 
important qualification to be made. The courts have held that the 
provincial Legislatures may not confer on a body other than a superior, 
district or county court judicial functions analogous to those performed by a 
superior, district or county court. This little separation of powers doctrine 
has been developed to preclude evasion of the stipulations of ss. 96 to 100 
of the constitution Act, 1867. 
If ss. 96 to 100 of the constitution Act 1867 were read literally they  
could easily be evaded by a province which wanted to assume control of  
its iudicial appointments. The province could increase the iurisdiction of its  
inferior courts so that they assumed much of the iurisdiction of the higher  
courts' or the province could best higher-court iurisdiction in a newly-
established tribunal and call that tribunal an inferior court or an  
administrative tribunal. It is therefore not surprising that the courts have  
added a gloss to s 96 and the associated constitutional provisions. What  
they have said is this: if a province invests a tribunal with a iurisdiction of a  
kind that ought property to belong to a superior district or county court  
then that tribunal whatever its official name is for constitutional purposes  
a superior district or county court and must satisfy the requirements of s.  
96 and the associated provisions of the constitution Act 1867. This means  
that such a tribunal will be invalidly constituted unless its members (1) are  
appointed by the federal government in conformity with s. 96 (2) are  
drawn from the bar of the province in conformity with ss. 97 and 98 and  
(3) receive salaries that are fixed and provided by the federal parliament in  
conformity with s. 100.  
So far the law is clear, and the policy underlying it is 
comprehensible. But the difficulty lies in the definition of those functions 
that ought properly to belong to a superior, district or county court. The 
courts have attempted to fashion a judicially enforceable rule which would 
separate ''s. 96 functions" from other adjudicatory functions. The attempt 
has not been successful, and it is difficult to predict with confidence how 
the courts will characterize particular adjudicatory functions. 	
The 
uncertainty of the law, with its risk of nullification, could be a serious 
deterrent to the conferral of new adjudicatory functions on inferior courts or 
administrative tribunals, and a consequent impediment to much new 
regulatory or social policy. For the most part. the courts have exercised 
restraint in reviewing the provincial statutes which create new adjudicatory 
jurisdictions, so that the difficulty has not been as serious as it could have 
been. However, in the last two decades, there has been a regrettable 
resurgence of s. 96 litigation. five challenges to the powers of inferior 
courts or tribunals based on s. 96 have succeeded in the Supreme Court

[1973] S.C.R. 681, and these decisions have spawned many more 
challenges. These developments are described in the text that follows. 
24. 	
It was also the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioners, that 
the proposition of law highlighted hereinabove on the basis of the provisions of 
constitutions of different countries (Jamaica, Ceylon, Australia and Canada) 
decided either by the Privy Council or the highest courts of the concerned 
countries, is fully applicable to India as well. In order to demonstrate this. he 
placed reliance on State of Maharashtra v. Labour Law Practitioners' 
Association, (1998) 2 SCC 638. The controversy in the cited case originated with 
the filing of a writ petition by the respondent Association challenging the 
appointment of Assistant Commissioners of Labour (i.e., Officers discharging 
executive functions under the Labour Department). The above appointments 
had been made, consequent upon amendments to the provisions of the Bombay 
Industrial Relations Act, and the Industrial Disputes (Maharashtra Amendment) 
Act. The submission advanced at the hands of the respondent Association was, 
that Labour Courts had been constituted in the State of Maharashtra, under the 
Industrial Disputes Act, the Bombay Industrial Relations Act, as also, the 
Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions and Prevention of Unfair Labour 
Practices, Act. Qualifications of persons to be appointed as a judge of the 
Labour Court under the Industrial Disputes Act, was stipulated in Section 7, 
which provided as under:- 	
60 
Page 60 
- 
161 - 
"(a) that he was or had been a Judge of a High Court; or 
(b) 
that he had for a period of not less than three years been a District 
Judge or an Additional District Judge; or 
(c) 
that he had held the office of the Chairman or any other Member of 
the Labour Appellate Tribunal or of any Tribunal for a period of not less 
than two years; or 
(d) 
that he had held any judicial office in India for not less than seven 
years; or 
(e) 
that he had been the Presiding Officer of a Labour Court constituted 
under any provincial Act for not less than five years." 
By the Industrial Disputes (Maharashtra Amendment) Act, 1974, Section 7 was 
amended, and three more sources of recruitment for the post of judge of the 
Labour Court were added. These were:- 
"(d-1) 	
he has practiced as an advocate or attorney for not less than 
seven years in the High Court, or any court, subordinate thereto, or any 
Industrial Court or Tribunal or Labour Court, constituted under any law for 
the time being in force; or 
(d-2) 
he holds a degree in law of a University established by law in any 
part of India and is holding or has held an office not lower in rank than that 
of a Deputy Registrar of any such Industrial Court or Tribunal for not less 
than five years; or 
(d-3) 
he holds a degree in law of University established by law in any 
part of India and is holding or has held an office not lower in rank than that 
of Assistant Commissioner of Labour under the State Government for not 
less than five years.” 
Under the Bombay Industrial Relations Act, as it originally stood. Section 9 
provided, that only such persons would be eligible for appointment as a judge of 
the Labour Court, who possessed the qualifications laid down under Article 234 
of the Constitution, for being eligible to enter judicial service in the State of 
Maharashtra. By the Maharashtra Act 47 of 1977, Section 9 of the Bombay 
Industrial Relations Act was amended by substituting a new sub-section (2), 
which replaced the original sub-section (2) of Section 9. The amended sub-
section (2) was as follows:- 
61 
Page 61 
''9. 	
(2) 	
A person shall not be qualified for appointment as the 
presiding officer of a Labour Court, unless: 
(a) 
he has held any judicial office in India for not less than five 
years; or 
(b) 
he has practiced as an Advocate or Attorney for not less than 
seven years in the High Court or any court subordinate thereto, or in 
any Industrial Court, Tribunal or Labour Court constituted under any 
law for the time being in force; or 
(c) 
he holds a degree in law of a University established by law in 
any part of India and is holding or has held an office not lower in 
rank than that of Deputy Registrar of any such Industrial Court or 
Tribunal. or of Assistant Commissioner of Labour under the State 
Government. in both cases for not less than five years.'' 
In the first instance. this Court for the first time declared the salient components 
of the functions exercised by a civil court , as under:- 
JP. 	
In the case of The Bharat Bank Ltd. v. Employees AIR 1950 SC  
188 this Court considered whether an Industrial Tribunal was a court. It 
said that one cannot go by mere nomenclature. One has to examine the 
functions of a Tribunal and how it proceeds to discharge those functions. It 
held that an Industrial Tribunal had all the trappings of a court and 
performed functions which cannot but be regarded as judicial. The Court 
referred to the Rules by which proceedings before the Tribunal were 
regulated. The Court dwelt on the fact that the powers vested in it are 
similar to those exercised by civil courts under the Code of Civil Procedure 
when 'trying a suit. It had the power of ordering discovery, inspection etc. 
and forcing the attendance of witnesses, compelling production of 
documents and so on. It gave its decision on the basis of evidence and in 
accordance with law. Applying the test laid down in the case of Cooper v. 
Wilson, (1937) 2 K.B. 309 at p.340 this Court said that "a true iudicial  
decision presupposes an existence of dispute between two or more parties  
and then involves four requisites - (11 the presentation of their case by the  
parties; (2) ascertainment of facts by means of evidence adduced by the  
parties often with the assistance of argument.  (3) if the dispute relates to a  
question of law submission of legal arguments by the parties-  and (4) by  
decision which disposes of the whole matter by findings on fact and  
application of law to facts so found. Judged by the same tests a Labour  
Court would undoubtedly be a court in the true sense of the term. The 
question, however, is whether such a court and the presiding officer of 
such a court can be said to hold a post in the judicial service of the State 
as defined in Article 236 of the Consfitutionh 
62 
Page 62 
-163- 
The other relevant observations recorded in the above cited judgment are 
reproduced below:- 
"13. Reliance has been placed upon this judgment as showing that 
judicial service is interpreted narrowly to cover only the hierarchy of civil 
courts headed by the District Judge. This Court, however, was not 
considering the position of other civil courts, in the context of the extensive 
definition given to the term "district judge. This Court was concerned with  
preserving independence of the iudiciary from the executive and makina  
sure that persons from non-iudicial services. such as the police excise or  
revenue were not considered as eligible for appointment as District  
Judges. That is why the emphasis is on the fact that the judicial service  
should consist exclusively of iudicial officers. This judgment should not be 
interpreted narrowly to exclude from judicial service new hierarchies of civil 
courts being set up which are headed by a judge who can be considered 
as a District Judge bearing in mind the extensive definition of that term in 
Article 236. 
14. The High Court has. therefore correctly interpreted the observations of  
this Court in Chandra Mohan vs. State of U.P. AIR 1966 SC 1987 as  
(riving paramount importance to the enforcement of the constitutional  
scheme providing for independence of the iudiciarv. The concern of the  
court was to see that this independence was not destroyed by an indirect  
method.  
xxx

18. 	
In the case of Shri Kumar Padma Prasad v. Union of India & Ors.. 
(1992) 2 SCC 428, this Court had to consider qualifications for the purpose 
of appointment as a Judge of the High Court under Article 217 of the 
Constitution. While interpreting the expression 'judicial office" under Article 
217(2)(a), this Court held that the expression "judicial office" must be 
interpreted in consonance with the scheme of Chapters V and VI of Part VI 
of the Constitution. So construed it means a judicial office which belongs to 
the judicial service as defined under Article 236(b). Therefore, in order to 
qualify for appointment as a judge of a High Court, a person must hold a 
judicial office which must be a part of the judicial service of the State. After 
referring to the cases of Chandra Mohan (supra) and Statesman (Private), 
Ltd. vs. H.R. Deb AIR 1968 SC 1495. this Court said that the term ludicial  
office in its generic sense may include a wide variety of offices which are  
connected with the administration of justice in one way or the other.  
Officers holding various posts under the executive are often vested with 
magisterial power to meet a particular situation. The Court said, 
"Did the framers of the Constitution have this type of 'offices' in mind 
when they provided a source of appointment to the high office, of a 
judge of the High Court from amongst the holders of a 'judicial 
office ? The answer, has to be in the negative. We are of the view  
63 
Page 63 
that holder of judicial office under Article 217(2)(a) means the person  
who exercises only judicial functions determines causes inter-
parties and renders decisions in a judicial capacity. He must belong  
to the judicial service which as a class is free from executive control  
and is disciplined to uphold the dignity integrity and independence  
of the judiciary."  
Going by these tests laid down as to what constitutes judicial service under  
Article 236 of the Constitution the Labour Court Woes and the iudaes of  
the Industrial Court can be held to belong to iudicial service. The hierarchy  
contemplated in the case of Labour Court judges is the hierarchy of Labour  
Court judges and Industrial Court judges with the Industrial Court Woes  
holding the superior position of District Judges. The Labour Courts have  
also been held as subject to the Huh Courts power of superintendence  
under Article 227  
xxx 	
xxx 	
xxx 
20. The constitutional scheme under Chapter V of Part VI dealing with 
the High Courts and Chapter VI of Part VI dealing with the subordinate 
courts shows a clear anxiety on the part of the framers of the Constitution 
to preserve and promote independence of the judiciary from the executive. 
Thus Article 233 which deals with appointment of District Judges requires 
that such appointments shall be made by the Governor of the State in 
consultation with the High Court. Article 233(2) has been interpreted as 
prescribing that "a person in the service of the Union or the State can 
refer only to a person in the judicial service of the Union or the State. 
Article 234 which deals with recruitment of persons other than District 
Judges to the judicial service requires that their appointments can be made 
only in accordance with the Rules framed by the Governor of the State 
after consultation with the State Public Service Commission and with the 
High Court. Article 235 provides that the control over district courts and 
courts subordinate thereto shall be vested in the High Court; and Article 
236 defines the expression "District Judge extensively as covering judges 
of a City Civil Court etc. as earlier set out, and the expression "judicial 
service.' as meaning a service consisting exclusively of persons intended 
to fill the post of the District Judge and other civil judicial posts inferior to 
the post of District Judge. Therefore bearing in mind the principle of  
separation of powers and independence of the judiciary. ludicial service  
contemplates a service exclusively of iudicial posts in which there will be a  
hierarchy headed by a District Judge. The High Court has rightly come to  
the conclusion that the persons presiding over Industrial and Labour  
Courts would constitute a iudicial service so defined. Therefore the  
recruitment of Labour Court judges is required to be made in accordance  
with Article 234 of the Constitution  
25. According to the learned counsel for the petitioners, the judgments and 
text cited hereinabove, are fully applicable on the subject of administration of 
Page 64 
justice through courts in India. Insofar as the instant aspect of the matter is 
concerned, learned counsel placed reliance on Article 50 of the Constitution, 
which is reproduced hereunder:- 
650. Separation of judiciary from executive - The State shall take steps to  
separate the iudiciary from the executive in the public services of the  
State" 
Based on Article 50 aforementioned, it was the contention of the learned counsel 
for the petitioners, that the Constitution itself mandates a separate judicial 
hierarchy of courts distinct from the executive. 
26. Coupled with the above mandate, it was the contention of the learned 
counsel for the petitioners, that the provisions of the Income Tax Act, the 
Customs Act, and the Excise Act prior to independence of this country, and even 
thereafter, vested the High Courts with an exclusive jurisdiction to settle 
"questions of law" emerging out of tax disputes. It was further contended, that 
even after the enforcement of the Constitution, with effect from 26.11.1949, the 
adjudicatory power to decide substantial questions of law, continued to be 
vested in the High Courts, inasmuch as, the jurisdictional High Courts continued 
to exercise appellate jurisdiction. The position has remained unaltered till date. 
It is, therefore, the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners, that 
historically, constitutionally and legally, the appellate jurisdiction in direct/indirect 
tax matters, has remained with the High Courts, and it is not permissible either by 
way of an amendment to the Constitution itself, or by enacting a legislation, to 
transfer the said appellate jurisdiction exercised by the High Courts to a quasi-
judicial tribunal. 
65 
Page 65 
The third contention'.  
27. In the course of the submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the 
petitioners on the third contention, wherein it was sought to be submitted, that 
"separation of powers", the 'rule of law" and "Judicial review" constitute amongst 
others. the "basic structure' of the Constitution, it was submitted, that Article 
3238 inserted by the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 was 
violative of the above mentioned components of the basic structure of the 
Constitution. Article 3238 is being extracted hereunder:- 
"323B. 	
Tribunals for other matters - (1) The appropriate Legislature 
may, by law, provide for the adjudication or trial by tribunals of any 
disputes, complaints, or offences with respect to all or any of the matters 
specified in clause (2) with respect to which such Legislature has power to 
make laws. 
(2) 	
The matters referred to in clause (1) are the following. namely:- 
(a) levy, assessment, collection and enforcement of any tax; 
(b) foreign exchange, import and export across customs frontiers; 
(c) industrial and labour disputes; 
(d) land reforms by way of acquisition by the State of any estate as 
defined in article 31A or of any rights therein or the extinguishment 
or modification of any such rights or by way of ceiling on agricultural 
land or in any other way; 
(e) ceiling on urban property; 
(f) elections to either House of Parliament or the House or either 
House of the Legislature of a State, but excluding the matters 
referred to in article 329 and article 329A; 
(g) production, procurement, supply and distribution of foodstuffs 
(including edible oilseeds and oils) and such other goods as the 
President may, by public notification, declare to be essential goods 
for the purpose of this article and control of prices of such goods; 
(h) rent, its regulation and control and tenancy issues including the 
rights, title and interest of landlords and tenants; 
(0 offences against laws with respect to any of the matters specified 
in sub-clauses (a) to (h) and fees in respect of any of those matters; 
(j) any matter incidental to any of the matters specified in sub- 
clauses (a) to (I)- 
(3) A law made under clause (1) may- 
(a) provide for the establishment of a hierarchy of tribunals- 
66 
Page 66 
-167- 
(b) specify the jurisdiction powers (including the power to punish for 
contempt) and authority which may be exercised by each of the said  
tribunals 
(c) provide for the procedure (including provisions as to limitation 
and rules of evidence) to be followed by the said tribunals' 
(d) exclude the jurisdiction of all courts except the jurisdiction of the  
Supreme Court under article 136 with respect to all or any of the  
matters falling within the iurisdiction of the said tribunals' 
(e) provide for the transfer to each such tribunal of any cases  
pending before any court or any other authority immediately before  
the establishment of such tribunal as would have been within the  
jurisdiction of such tribunal if the causes of action on which such  
suits or proceedings are based had arisen after such establishment' 
(1) contain such supplemental incidental and consequential  
provisions (including provisions as to fees) as the appropriate  
Legislature may deem necessary for the effective functioning of and  
for the speedy disposal of cases by. and the enforcement of the  
orders of such tribunals. 
(4) The provisions of this article shall have effect notwithstanding anything  
in any other provision of this Constitution or in any other law for the time  
being in force.  
Explanation. In this article, ''appropriate Legislature", in relation to any 
matter, means Parliament or, as the case may be, a State Legislature 
competent to make laws with respect to such matter in accordance with 
the provisions of Part XL" 
Insofar as the aforesaid provision is concerned it was submitted, that Clause (3) 
of Article 323B clearly violated all the above mentioned ingredients of the 'basic 
structure" theory. In this behalf it was sought to be asserted, that establishment 
of a hierarchy of tribunals implicitly led to the inference, that the existing judicial 
process, where adjudication was before a court of law, was to be substituted in 
its entirety. Thereby, even the existing appellate process which was vested in 
High Courts was sought to be substituted by tribunals. It was submitted, that 
creation of a parallel judicial system. was alien to the provisions of the 
Constitution, which recognized the judiciary as an independent component, 
separate from the executive and the legislature. It was accordingly vehemently 
67 
Page 67 
-168- 
 
asserted, that the process of justice was being substituted, by tribunalization of 
justice, which was clearly unacceptable under the Constitution. Sub-clause (d) of 
Article 323B(3), according to the learned counsel for the petitioners, divested 
jurisdiction vested in all civil courts for the adjudication of the matters on the 
subjects referred to in Article 323B(2), including not only the appellate jurisdiction 
of High Courts, but also, the power of "judicial review" vested in High Courts 
under Articles 226 and 227, of the Constitution. It was also the contention of the 
learned counsel for the petitioners, that despite decisions rendered by this Court, 
the legislature has repeated and reiterated what had been found to be 
unsustainable in law. 
28. While canvassing the aforesaid contention learned counsel for the 
petitioners pointed out, that the above mentioned Article 323B was introduced by 
the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976, which was part of an 
overall scheme, to drastically curtail the power of 'judicial review' vested with the 
higher judiciary. It was pointed out, that all other objectionable provisions were 
deleted, and powers earlier vested in superior courts were restored. However, 
Part XIV A of the Constitution, inserting Articles 323A and 3238 was allowed to 
remain. It was submitted that Articles 323A and 3238, enabled the creation of 
parallel judiciary under executive control. In order to support his aforestated 
contention, learned counsel invited the Courts attention to the expressions 
"adjudication or trial", "disputes, complaints or offences", "transfer of suits or 
proceedings", etc. which could be fashioned in a manner different from that which 
presently prevailed. It was pointed out, that the aforestated mandate contained 
68 
Page 69 
in Article 323B of the Constitution, was incompatible with the "basic structure" of 
the Constitution, which mandates "separation of powers". 
29. 
In view of the aforementioned submissions, it was the vehement 
contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners, that Article 3238(4) should 
be struck down. It was submitted, that if the instant prayer of the petitioners does 
not find favour with this Court, the alternative prayer of the petitioners was, that 
Article 3238 must be purposefully interpreted, so as to bestow equivalence 
commensurate to the Court sought to be substituted by the tribunal. It was 
submitted, that it was imperative to provide for measures to ensure 
independence in the functioning of tribunals substituting functions carried out by 
courts. This could be done, according to learned counsel for the petitioners, by 
extending the conditions of service applicable to judges of the court sought to be 
substituted. In order to support his aforestated contention, learned counsel for 
the petitioners placed reliance on judgments rendered by this Court, laying down 
the limits and parameters within which such tribunals could be created. Despite 
the declaration of law by this Court it was submitted, that the NH Act, has been 
enacted, which suffers from the same vices, which had already been found to be 
unconstitutional. For reasons of brevity, it is considered inappropriate, to refer to 
all the judgments relied upon by the rival parties on the instant issue. Suffice it to 
state, that the same will be examined, only while recording conclusions. 
The fourth contention: 
30. 
While advancing the fourth contention, learned counsel for the petitioners 
referred to various provisions of the NTT Act, which would have the effect of 
69 
Page 69 
compromising the independence of the NTT. We may briefly refer to the 
provisions of the said Act, highlighted by the learned counsel for the petitioners, 
during the course of hearing, as under:- 
0) 	
First and foremost, reference was made to Section 5 of the NTT Act. The 
same is being extracted hereunder:- 
"5. 	
Constitution and jurisdiction of Benches- (1) the jurisdiction of the 
National Tax Tribunal may be exercised by the Benches thereof to be 
constituted by the Chairperson. 
(2) 
The Benches of the National Tax Tribunal shall ordinarily sit at any  
place in the National Capital Territory of Delhi or such other places as the  
Central Government may in consultation with the Chairperson notify: 
Provided that the Chairperson may for adequate reasons permit a 
Bench to hold its temporary sitting for a period not exceeding fifteen days 
at a place other than its ordinary place of seat 
(3) 
The Central Government shall notify the areas in relation to which 
each bench of the National Tax Tribunal may exercise its jurisdiction. 
(4) 
The Central Government shall determine the number of Benches 
and each Bench shall consist of two members. 
(5) 
The Central Government may transfer a Member from headquarters  
of one Bench in one State to the headquarters of another Bench in another  
State or to the headquarters of any other Bench within a State:  
Provided that no member shall be transferred without the concurrence of 
the ChairpersonT 
Referring to sub-section (2) of Section 5 it was sought to be asserted, that 
benches of the NTT are ordinarily to function in the National Capital Territory of 
Delhi. This, according to the learned counsel for the petitioners, would deprive 
the litigating assessee, the convenience of approaching the High Court of the 
State to which he belongs. In this behalf it was sought to be asserted, that in 
every tax related dispute, there is an asseessee on one side, and the Revenue 
on the other. Accordingly, if the NTT is mandated to sit ordinarily in the National 
Capital Territory of Delhi, assessees from far flung States would have to suffer 
extreme hardship for the redressal of their grievance, especially at the appellate 
70 
Page 70 
stage. Besides the hardships, it was painted out, that each asseessee would be 
subjected to unfathomable financial expense. Referring to sub-section (5) of 
Section 5 of the NTT Act, it was the submission of the learned counsel for the 
petitioners, that the Central Government was vested with the power to transfer a 
Member from the headquarters of one bench in one State, to the headquarters of 
another bench in another State. It was also open to the Central Government to 
transfer a Member from one bench to another bench in the same State. It was 
submitted, that in cas of High Courts, such power is exercised exclusively by 
the Chief Justice, in the best interest of the administration of justice. It was 
submitted, that the Central Government, which is a stakeholder, could exercise 
the above power of transfer for harassment and exploitation of sitting Members of 
the NTT. In other words, an inconvenient Member could be moved away, and 
replaced by one who would tow the desired line. 
(ii) Likewise, learned counsel for the petitioners referred to Section 6 of the 
NTT Act to demonstrate, that the same would also have an undermining effect on 
the adjudicatory process. Section 6 of the NTT Act is reproduced hereunder:- 
"6. 	
Qualifications for appointment of Chairperson and other Members — 
(1) 
The Chairperson of the National Tax Tribunal shall be a person who 
has been a Judge of the Supreme Court or the Chief Justice of a High 
Court. 
(2) 
A person shall not be qualified far appointment as Member unless  
he- 
(a) 
is or has been or is eligible to be a Judge of a Hi Court; or 
(b) 
is or has been. a Member of the Income-tax Appellate  
Tribunal or of the Customs. Excise and Service Tax Appellate  
Tribunal for at least five years."  
Learned counsel for the petitioners pointed out, that sub-section (2), 
aforementioned, laid down the qualifications for appointment as Member of the 
71 
Page 71 
NTT. Referring to clause (a) of sub-section (2) of Section 6 of the NTT Act it was 
submitted, that a person who is eligible to be a judge of a High Court, is to be 
treated as eligible as a member of the NTT. Inviting our attention to Article 217 
of the Constitution it was submitted, that a person who is a citizen of India and 
has, for at least 10 years, practiced as an Advocate before one or the other High 
Court, has been treated as eligible for being appointed as a Member of the NTT. 
Referring to Section 8 of the NTT Act it was pointed out, that a Member of the 
NTT is provided with a tenure of five years, from the date of his appointment as 
Member of the NTT. It was pointed out, that in terms of Article 217 of the 
Constitution, a person would easily become eligible for appointment as a judge at 
or around the age of 35-40 years, and as such, if he is assured a tenure of only 
five years, it would not be possible for him to discharge his duties without fear or 
favour, inasmuch as, he would always have a larking uncertainty in his mind 
about his future, after the expiry of the prescribed term of five years, in the event 
of not being granted an extension. Relying on clause (b) of Section 6(2) of the 
NTT Act, it was also the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioners, 
that Members of the Appellate Tribunals constituted under the Income Tax Act, 
the Customs Act, and the Excise Act, are also eligible for being appointed as 
Members of the NTT. In this behalf it was sought to be asserted, that there are 
Accountant Members of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. who too would 
become eligible for appointment as Members of the NTT. It was submitted, that 
judicial experience on the niceties of law, specially on the different aspects, 
which need to be dealt with while adjudicating tax matters, would be alien to 
Page 72 
them, inasmuch as they can only be experts on the subject of accountancy. It 
was pointed out, that the jurisdiction vested in the NTT, is an alternative 
jurisdiction to that of the High Court, and as such, it is difficult to appreciate how 
an Accountant Member of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal can be expected to 
discharge duties relating to settling substantial questions of law in the manner 
judges of the High Court dispense with the aforesaid responsibilities. 
(iii) Learned counsel for the petitioners then invited our attention to Section 7 
of the NTT Act. The said section is reproduced hereunder- 
"7. 	
Appointment of Chairperson and other Members - (1) Subject to 
the provisions of sub-section (2), the Chairperson and every other Member 
shall be appointed by the Central Government. 
(2) 	
The Chairperson and the other Members shall be appointed by the  
Central Government on the recommendations of a Selection Committee  
consisting of- 
(a) 
the Chief Justice of India or a Judge of the Supreme Court 
nominated by him- 
(b) 
the Secretary in the Ministry of Law and Justice (Department  
of Legal Affairs)' 
(c) 
the Secretary in the Ministry of Finance (Department of  
Revenua 
(3) 	
No appointment of the Chairperson or of any other Member shall be 
invalidated merely by reason of any vacancy or any defect in the 
constitution of the Selection Committee." 
A perusal of sub-section (2) of Section 7 reveals the composition of the selection 
committee for selection of the Chairperson and Members of the NTT. It was 
sought to be pointed out, that there were two representatives of the executive, 
out of three member selection committee, and only one member in the selection 
committee was from the judiciary. Accordingly it was asserted, that the two 
representatives belonging to the executive would control the outcome of every 
selection process. Since the NTT was, an alternative to the jurisdiction earlier 
73 
Page 73 
vested with the High Court, it was submitted, that the same process of selection, 
as was prevalent for appointment of judges of the High Court, should be adopted 
for selection of Chairperson and Members of the NTT. All that is imperative and 
essential is, that the selection process should be the same, as is in place, for the 
court sought to be substituted. It was also the contention of the learned counsel 
for the petitioners, that a provision similar to Section 7(2) of the NTT Act, had 
been struck dawn by this Court, in State of Maharashtra v. Labour Law 
Practitioners' Association (supra). 
(iv) 	
Learned counsel for the petitioners then invited our attention to Section 8 
of the NTT Act. Section 8 is being reproduced hereunder:- 
'S. Terms of office of Chairperson and other Members - The  
auaiiperson and every other Member shall hold office as such for a term of 
five years from the date on which he enters upon his office but shall be  
eligible for re-appointment 
Provided that no Chairperson or other Member shall hold office as 
such after he has attained, - 
(a) 
in the case of Chairperson, the age of sixty-eight years; and 
(b) 
in the case of any other Member, the age of sixty-five years." 
According to learned counsel, a perusal of Section 8 reveals, that a Chairperson 
and a Member of the NTT would hold office for a term of five years, from the date 
of his/her appointment to the NTT. It was, however sought to be pointed out, that 
a person appointed as such, is clearly eligible for reappointment. It was sought 
to be asserted, that a provision for reappointment, would itself have the effect of 
undermining the independence of the Members of the NTT. It was sought to be 
asserted, that each one of the appointees to the NTT would be prompted to 
appease the Revenue, so as to solicit reappointment contemplated under 
Section 8 of the NTT Act. In this behalf it was submitted, that the tenure of 
74 
Page 74 
appointment to a tribunal, which is to substitute a High Court, should be akin to 
that of a judge of High Court. 
(v) Our attention was then invited to Section 13 of the NTT Act, which is 
reproduced hereunder:- 
G3, Appearance before National Tax Tribunal - (1) A partv to an  
appeal other than Government may either appear in person or authorize  
one or more chartered accountants or leg al practitioners to present his or  
its case before the National Tax Tribunal. 
(2) 	
The Government may authorize one or more legal practitioners or 
any of its officers to present its case before the National Tax Tribunal. 
Explanation — For the purposes of this Section,- 
(a) 
''chartered accountant' means a chartered accountant as 
defined in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 2 of the Chartered 
Accountants Act, 1949 (38 of 1949) and who has obtained a 
certificate of practice under sub-section (1) of section 6 of that Act: 
(b) 
'legal practitioner' means an advocate, a vakil or any attorney 
of any High Court, and includes a pleader in practice." 
It was submitted, that besides allowing the assessee to represent himself before 
the NTT, Section 13 allows him to be represented through one or more 
Chartered Accountants or legal practitioners_ Thus far, according to learned 
counsel for the petitioners, there seemed to be no difficulty in Section 13(1) of the 
NTT Act_ However, allowing any person duly authorized" by the assessee to 
represent him before the NTT, ffi clearly ununderstandable. It was submitted, 
that the main function of the NTT would be to settle substantial questions of law 
on tax issues. and as such, under Section 13(1), it would be open to an assessee 
to engage an individual to represent him, even though he is totally unqualified in 
the fields on which the adjudicatory process is to be conducted. Likewise, it is 
the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners, besides legal 
practitioners, the Revenue is allowed to be represented through any of its 
75 
Page 75 
— b – 
officers. It was sought to be asserted, that an understanding of the text of the 
provision is one thing, whereas interpreting it in the contemplated context, quite 
another. As such, it was submitted, that officers of the Revenue; who lack in 
interpretative skills, would be wholly unsuited for representing the Revenue 
before the NTT. 
Submissions in opposition, by the respondents/interveners:  
The first contention: 
31. 	
In response to the first contention, namely, that the reasons for setting up 
the NTT were fallacious and non-existent, and as such, the legislative enactment 
under reference creating the NTT as an independent appellate forum to decide 
appeals on "substantial questions" of law, from orders passed by the Appellate 
Tribunals constituted under the Income Tax Act, the Customs Act, and the Excise 
Act deserves to be set aside; it was the contention of the learned counsel for the 
respondents, that the submissions advanced at the hands of the petitioners, were 
premised on an improper understanding of the factual background. In this 
behalf. it is sought to be asserted, that the tax receipts are the primary source of 
revenue in India. The Government of India meets its budgetary requirements 
from revenue receipts. It is sought to be explained, that tax is collected by an 
established administrative and legal structure. On the one hand, while fastening 
of a tax liability would reduce the profits of an assessee, it would enhance the 
revenue receipts of the Government. On the other hand, exemption from a tax 
76 
Page 76 
-117- 
 
liability would increase profits of an assessee, but would reduce the revenue 
receipts of the Government. In view of the above profit and loss scenario, 
administration of tax loss, has an inherent tendency to result in disputes and 
litigation. The process of litigation is primarily based on adoption of innovative 
means of interpretation of law, both by the revenue and by the tax payers. As a 
result, significant amount of time is spent, on long drawn litigation, wherein tax 
payers and the Government lock horns against one another. Naturally, this 
impacts revenue earnings as levy of tax of thousands of crores of rupees, 
remains embroiled in such litigation. It was sought to be pointed out. that as per 
the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Database, Indian companies have a 
vast amount locked in disputed taxes. As per the above report, during the 
Financial Year 2011-2012; 30 companies that make up the Bombay Stock 
Exchange sensex, had money locked in disputed taxes estimated at Rs.42,388 
crores. The above disputed tax liability, according to the learned counsel for the 
respondents, was a 27% increase from the amount of the preceding year, which 
was estimated at Rs.33,339 crores. 
32. 	
In respect of disputes on direct taxes, it was submitted, that in a written 
reply submitted by the Minster of State for Finance, the Lok Sabha was informed 
in April, 2012, that 5,943 tax cases were pending with the Supreme Court, and 
30,213 direct tax cases were pending with High Courts. It was submitted that the 
Lok Sabha was additionally informed, that the disputed amount of tax, at various 
levels, was estimated at Rs.4,36,741 crores, as on 31.12.2011. It was further 
sought to be asserted, that in the preceding year, the estimate in respect of The 
77 
Page 77 
disputed amount at various levels, was to the tune of Rs.243,603 crores. 
Accordingly it was sought to be pointed out, that with each succeeding year, not 
only the tax related litigation was being progressively enhanced, there was also a 
significant increase in the finance blocked in such matters. 
33. 	
It was likewise pointed out, that the number of cases involving levy of 
indirect taxes, projected a similar unfortunate reflection. In this behalf, it was 
sought to be pointed out, that as on 31.12.2012, the number of pending customs 
disputes were approximately 17,800, wherein an amount of approximately 
Rs 7.400 crores was involved. Insofar as the number of pending central excise 
cases as on 31.10.2012 is concerned, the figure was approximately 19,800 and 
the amount involved was approximately Rs.21,450 crores. By adding the figures 
reflected hereinabove, in respect of the disputes pertaining to indirect taxes, it 
was suggested that a total of about 37,600 cases were pending, involving an 
amount of approximately Rs.28,850 crores. Additionally it was submitted, that 
out of the 17,800 customs cases, approximately 6,300 cases had been pending 
for adjudication for periods ranging from one to three years, and approximately 
2,800 customs cases had been pending adjudication for over three years. 
Likewise, out of the 19,800 central excise cases, 1,600 cases were pending for 
decision for a period between one to three years; and 240 cases had been 
pending for decision for over three years. 
34. 	
It was pointed out at the behest of the respondents, that several reasons 
contributed to the prolonged continuation of tax disputes. The main reason 
however was, that there was a lack of clarity in law in tax litigation. It was 
78 
Page 78 
17 - 
submitted, that the above lack of clarity resulted in multiple interpretations. 
Added to that, according to the learned counsel for the respondents, existence of 
multiple appellate levels, and independent jurisdictional High Courts, resulted in 
the existence of conflicting opinions at various appellate forums across the 
country, contributing in unfathomable delay and multiplicity of proceedings. 
35. Based on the factors narrated above, it was the submission of the learned 
counsel for the respondents, that the burden of high volume of disputes had had 
the effect of straining the adjudicatory, as well as, the judicial system. It was 
pointed out, that the judicial system was already heavily burdened by the weight 
of significant number of unresolved cases. It was submitted, that the addition of 
cases each year, added not only to the inconvenience of the taxpayer, but also to 
the revenue earned by the government. It was pointed out, that the instant state 
of affairs created an uncertain and destabilized business environment, with 
taxpayers not being able to budget, for tax costs. Importantly such uncertainty, 
according to the learned counsel, emerged out of the two factors. Firstly, the law 
itself was complex. and therefore, uncertain. And secondly, for an interpretation 
of the law to achieve a degree of certainty at the Supreme Court level, required 
several rounds of litigation. It was submitted, that in view of the above, the 
current scenario called for reforms in the dispute resolution mechanism, and the 
introduction of, conscious practices and procedures, aimed at limiting the 
initiation, as well as, the prolongation of tax disputes. It is, therefore, the 
submission of the learned counsel for the respondents, that the assertions made 
79 
Page 79 
at the hands of the petitioners, while projecting the first contention, were wholly 
misconceived, and as such, are liable to be rejected. 
The second contention: 
36. 	
In response to the second contention, namely, that it is impermissible for 
the legislature to abrogate the core judicial appellate functions, traditionally 
vested with the High Court, or that it is impermissible to vest the same with an 
independent, parallel quasi-judicial hierarchy of tribunals, it was submitted, that 
the petitioners had not been able to appreciate the matter in its correct 
perspective. It was pointed out, that the NTT Act is a legislation which creates an 
appellate forum, in a hierarchy of fora, as a remedy for ventilation of grievances 
emerging out of taxing statutes. To fully appreciate the purport of the special 
remedy created by the statute, the nature of the right and/or the liability created 
by the taxing statutes, and the enforcement for which these remedies have been 
provided, needed to be understood in the correct perspective. Accordingly, in 
order to debate the rightful cause, learned counsel drew our attention to the 
proposition, in the manner, as was understood by the respondents. The 
submissions advanced in this behalf are being summarized hereinafter. 
37. 	
It was the contention of the learned counsel for the respondents, that the 
Income Tax Act, the Customs Act, and the Excise Act, as also, other taxing 
statutes create a statutory liability. The said statutory liability has no existence, 
de hors the statute itself. The said statutory liability, has no existence in common 
law. It was further submitted, that it had been long well settled, that where a right 
to plead liability had no existence in common law, but was the creation of a 
SO 
Page 90 
181 - 
 
statute, which simultaneously provided for a special and particular remedy for 
enforcing it, the remedy provided by the statute was bound to be followed. In 
respect of such statutory liability, it was not competent for the party to proceed, 
by action at common law. In this behalf, our attention was invited to the 
observations recorded by this Court in Dhulabhai v. State of M.P. (1968) 3 SCR 
662 wherein the Court observed as under: 
"9. The question that arises in these appeals has been before this Court 
in relation to other statutes and has been answered in different ways. 
These appeals went before a Divisional Bench of this Court but in view of 
the difficulty presented by the earlier rulings of this Court, they were 
referred to the Constitution Bench and that is how they are before us. At 
the very start we may observe that the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts is all  
embracing except to the extent it is excluded by an express provision of  
law or by clear intendment arising from such law. This is the purport of 
Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure. How Section 9 operates is 
perhaps best illustrated by referring to the categories of cases, mentioned 
by Wiles,J. in Wolverhampton New Waterworks Co. v. 
Hawkesford, [1859] 6 C.B. (NS) 336 - They are: 
 
"One is where there was a liability existing at common law and that  
liability is affirmed by a statute which gives a special and peculiar  
form of remedy different from the remedy which existed at common  
law: there unless the statute contains words which expressly or by  
necessary implication exclude the common law remedy the party  
suing has his election to pursue either that or the statutory remedy.  
The second class of cases is where the statue gives the right to sue  
merely but provides no particular form of remedy: there the party  
can only proceed by action at common law. But there is a third class  
viz. where a liability not existing at common law is created by a  
statute which at the same time gives a special and particular remedy  
for enforcing it 	
The remedy provided by the statute must be  
followed and it is not competent to the party to pursue the course  
applicable to cases of the second class: 
This view of Willes, J. was accepted by the House of Lords in Neville v. 
London 'Express' Newspaper Ltd., [1919] A.G. 368. 
xxx

xxx 
35. Neither of the two cases of Firm of Illud Subayya or Kamla Mills can 
be said to run counter to the series of cases earlier noticed. The result of 
this inquiry into the diverse views expressed in this Court may be stated 
as follows :- 
81 
Page 61 
(1) Where the statute gives a finality to the orders of the special  
tribunals the Civil Courts' iurisdiction must be held to be excluded if  
there is adequate remedy to do what the Civil Courts would normally  
do in a suit. Such provision, however, does not exclude those cases 
where the provisions of the particular Act have not been complied 
with or the statutory tribunal has not acted in conformity with the 
fundamental principles of judicial procedure. 
(2) Where there is an express bar of the iurisdiction of the court- an  
examination of the scheme of the particular Act to find the adequacy  
or the sufficiency of the remedies provided may be relevant but is  
not decisive to sustain the iurisdiction of the civil court. 
Where there is no express exclusion the examination of the  
remedies and the scheme of the particular Act to find out the  
intendment becomes necessary and the result of the inquiry may be  
decisive. In the latter case it is necessary to see if the statute creates  
pecial right or a liability and provides for the determination of the  
right or liability and further lays down that all questions about the  
said r ht and liability shall be determined by the tribunals so  
constituted and whether remedies normally associated with actions  
in Civil Courts are prescribed by the said statue or not. 
(3) Challenge to the provisions of the particular Act as ultra vires  
cannot be brought before Tribunals constituted under that Act Even  
the High Court cannot qo into that Question on a revision or  
reference from the decision of the Tribunals. 
(4) When a provision is already declared unconstitutional or the 
constitutionality of any provision is to be challenged. a suit is open. A 
writ of certiorari may include a direction for refund if the claim is 
clearly within the time prescribed by the Limitation Act but it is not a 
compulsory remedy to replace a suit. 
(5) Where the particular Act contains no machinery for refund of tax 
collected in excess of constitutional limits or illegally collected a suit 
lies. 
(6) Questions of the correctness of the assessment apart from its 
constitutionality are for the decision of the authorities and a civil suit 
does not lie if the orders of the authorities are declared to be final or 
there is an express prohibition in the particular Act. In either case the 
scheme of the particular Act must be examined because it is a 
relevant enquiry. 
(7) An exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is not readily to 
be interred unless the conditions above set down apply." 
33. In addition to the above submissions, it was sought to be asserted that the 
Income Tax Act expressly barred the jurisdiction of civil courts. Reference in this 
82 
Page 82 
- 183- 
 
behalf was made to Section 293 of the Income Tax Act, which is being extracted 
hereunder: 
'293. Bar of suits in civil courts. — No suit shall be brought in any civil court  
to set aside or modify any proceedina taken or order made under this Act  
and no prosecution suit or other proceeding shall lie against the  
Government or any officer of the Government for anything in good faith  
done or intended to be done under this Act." 
39. 	
It has been further held by this Court following the dictum at Barraclough v. 
Brown (1897) AC 615, that if a statute confers a right and in the same breath 
provides for enforcement of such right the remedy provided by such a statute is 
an exclusive one. Applying this doctrine, in Premier Automobiles v. Kamlekar 
Shantaram Wadke, (1976) 1 SCC 496 at 513, this Court held as under: 
"23. To sum up, the principles applicable to the jurisdiction of the Civil 
Court in relation to an industrial dispute may be stated thus: 
(1) If the dispute is not an industrial dispute nor does it relate to  
enforcement of any other right under the Act the remedy lies only in the  
civil Court. 
(2) If the dispute is an industrial dispute arising out of a right or liability  
under the general or common law and not under the Act the iurisdiction of  
the civil Court is alternative leaving it to the election of the suitor  
concerned to choose his remedy for the relief which is competent to be  
granted in a particular remedy. 
(3) If the industrial dispute relates to the enforcement of a right or an 
obligation created under the Act then the only remedy available to the  
suitor is to get an adiudication under the Act. 
(4) If the right which is sought to be enforced is a right created under the  
Act such as Chapter VA then the remedy for its enforcement is either  
Section 33C or the raising of an industrial dispute as the case may be." 
In paragraph 12 of the Premier Automobiles case (supra), this Court quoted the 
words of Lord Watson in Barraclough v. Brown (supra) to the following effect: 
"the right and the remedy are given uno flatu and the one cannot be 
disassociated from the other' 
83 
Page 83 
40. 	
It is for this reason, according to learned counsel for the respondents, that 
civil courts, even the High Court having original jurisdiction, would not entertain 
suits on matters covered by such special statutes creating rights and providing 
remedies. [See Argosam Finance Co. Ltd. v. Oxby (1964) 1 All E.R. 791 at 796- 
H]. 
"The principle underlying those passages seem to me to be applicable to 
the present case Section 341 of the Income Tax Act, 1952, confers the 
right, the right to an adjustment tax liability by reference to loss; that right 
does not exist independently of the section; the section uno flatu in the 
breath gives a specific remedy and appoints a specific tribunal for its 
enforcement, namely the General Commission or Special Commissioners. 
In those circumstances in my judgment, the taxpayer must resort to that 
remedy and that tribunal. In due course if dissatisfied with the decision of 
the commissioners concerned he can appeal to the high court by way 
Case Stated, but any original jurisdiction of the high court by declaration or 
otherwise, is, in my judgment, excluded .° 
The contentions of the petitioners, that substituting Section 260A of the Income 
Tax Act and divesting the High Court of the appellate remedy and vesting it in the 
NTT, is unconstitutional as it constitutes an inroad into the principles of the rule of 
law and independence of judiciary, according to learned counsel, are fallacious. 
41. 	
According to the learned counsel for the respondents, the fallacy in the 
petitioners' argument is, that they are overlooking the fact that as far as the NTT 
Act is concerned, there is no common law remedy which has now been divested. 
Section 260A of the Income Tax Act and Section 35(g). (h), (i) of the Excise Act 
were all statutorily vested appeals, in the High Court, and as such, as has been 
held in the above mentioned cases can be completely divested. According to 
learned counsel, the NTT Act, was on a surer and sounder footing, than the 
provisions of the Companies Act, which came up for consideration in Union of 
84 
Page 84 
135- 
 
India v. Madras Bar Association, (2010) 11 SCC 87. Accordingly, as no common 
law remedy has been substituted under the present Act, it was submitted, that 
the contentions advanced on behalf of the petitioners had no legs to stand. Even 
when the Companies Act set up, the Company Law Tribunal and the Company 
Law Appellate Tribunal, substituting the jurisdiction of the High Courts, this Court 
in Union of India v. Madras Bar Association (supra), held that the said provisions 
were valid and were not unconstitutional. This Court held as under: 
"87. The Constitution contemplates judicial power being exercised by both 
courts and tribunals. Except the powers and iurisdictions vested in superior  
courts by the Constitution powers and iurisdiction of courts are controlled  
and regulated by Legislative enactments. The High Courts are vested with  
the jurisdiction to entertain and hear appeals revisions and references in  
pursuance of provisions contained in several specific legislative  
enactments. If jurisdiction of the High Courts can be created by providing  
for appeals revisions and references to be heard by the High Courts. 
jurisdiction can also be taken away by deleting the provisions for appeals. 
revisions or references. It also follows that the legislature has the power to 
create tribunals with reference to specific enactments and confer 
jurisdiction on them to decide disputes in regard to matters arising from 
such special enactments. Therefore it cannot be said that legislature has 
no power to transfer judicial functions traditionally performed by courts to 
tribunals." 
88. The argument that there cannot be “whole-sale transfer of powers" is 
misconceived. It is nobody's case that the entire functioning of courts in the 
country is transferred to tribunals. The competence of the Parliament to  
make a law creating tribunals to deal with disputes arising under or relating 
to a particular statute or statutes cannot be disputed. When a Tribunal is  
constituted under the Companies Act empowered to deal with disputes  
arising under the said Act and the statute substitutes the word "tribunal" in  
place of "the High Court" necessarily there will be "whole-sale transfer of  
company law matters to the tribunals. It is an inevitable consequence of  
creation of a tribunal for such disputes and will no way affect the validity  
of the law creating the tribunal." 
42. 	
Similarly, statutory provisions providing for a revision to the District Judge, 
with the finality clauses, have been interpreted to exclude the revisionary powers 
85 
Page 05 
of the High Court under Section 115 of CPC. In this behalf reference was made 
to, Aundal Animal v. Sadasivan Pilai, (1987) 1 SCC 183, wherein it was held as 
under: 
515. Under the scheme of the Act it appears that a landlord who wants 
eviction of his tenant has to move for eviction and the case has to be 
disposed of by the Rent Control Court. That is provided by Sub-section(2) 
of Section 11 of the Act. From the Rent Control Court, an appeal lies to the 
Appellate Authority under the conditions laid down under Sub-section (I)(b) 
of Section 18 of the Act. From the Appellate Authority a revision in certain 
circumstances lies in case where the appellate authority is a Subordinate 
Judge to the District Court and in other cases to the High Court. In this 
case as mentioned hereinbefore the appeal lay from Rent Control Court to 
the appellate authority who was the Subordinate Judge and therefore the 
revision lay to the District Judge. Indeed it is indisputed that the 
respondent has in this case taken resort to all these prov sions. After the 
dismissal of the revision by the District Judge from the appellate decision 
of the Subordinate Judge who confirmed the order of the Rent Controller, 
the respondent-landlord chose again to go before the H gh Court under 
Section 115 of the CPC. The question, is, can he have a second revision 
to the High Court? Shri Poti submitted that he cannot. We are of the 
opinion that he is right. This position is clear if Sub-section (5) of 
Section 18 of the Act is read in conjunction with Section 20 of the Act. Sub-
section (5) of Section 16, as we have noted hereinbefore, clearly sapulates 
that the decision of the appellate authority and subject to such decision, an 
order of the Rent Controller 'shall be final' and 'shall not be liable to be 
called in question in any court of law', except as provided in Section 20. By 
Section 20, a revision is provided where the appellate authority is 
Subordinate Judge to the District Judge and in other cases, that is to say, 
where the appellate authority is District Judge, to the High Court. The 
ambits of revisional powers are well-settled and need not be re-stated. It is 
inconceivable to have two revisions. The scheme of the Act does not 
warrant such a conclusion. In our opinion, the expression 'shall be final' in 
the Act means what it says. 
20. The learned judge referred to the decision of the Judicial Committee in 
the case of Maung Ba Thaw and Ant —Insolvents v. Ma Pin, AIR 1934 PC 
81. The learned judge also referred to a decision of this Court in South 
Asia Industries (P) Ltd. v. S.B. Sarup Singh and Ors. (supra). The learned 
judge concluded that so long as there was no specific provision in the 
statute making the determination by the District Court final and excluding 
the supervisory power of the High Court under Section 115 of the CPO, it 
had to be held that the decision rendered by the District Court under 
Section 20(1) of the Act being a decision of a court subordinate to the High 
56 
Page 86 
Court to which an appeal lay to the High Court was liable to be revised by 
the High Court under Section 115 of the CPC. In that view of the matter, 
the Full Bench rejected the view of the division bench of the Kerala High 
Court in Kurien v. Chacko [1960] KLT 1248. With respect, we are unable to 
sustain the view of the Full Bench of the High Court on this aspect of the 
matter. In our opinion, the Full Bench misconstrued the provisions of 
subsection (5) of Section 18 of the Act. Sub-secton (5) of 
Section18 clearly states that such decision of the appellate authority as 
mentioned in Section 18 of the Act shall not be liable to be questioned 
except in the manner under Section 20 of the Act. There was thereby an 
implied prohibition or exclusion of a second revision under Section 115 of 
the CPC to the High Court when a revision has been provided under 
Section 20 of the Act in question. When Section 18(5) of the Act 
specifically states that "shall not be liable to be called in question in any 
Court of law" except in the manner provided under Section 20, it cannot be 
said that the High Court which is a court of law and which is a civil court 
under the CPC under Section 115 of the CPC could revise again an order 
once again after revision under Section20 of the Act. That would mean 
there would be a trial by four courts, that would be repugnant to the 
scheme manifest in the different sections of the Act in question. Public 
policy or public interest demands curtailment of law's delay and justice 
demands finality within quick disposal of case. The language of the 
provisions of Section 18(5) read with Section 20 inhibits further revision. 
The courts must so construe." 
Likewise, our attention was invited to Jetha Bai and Sons v. Sunderdas Rathenai 
(1988) 1 SCC 722, and reliance was placed on the following: 
"15. Even without any discussion it may be seen from the narrative given 
above that there is really no conflict between the two decisions because 
the provisions in the two Acts are materially different. However, to clarify 
matters further we may point put the differences between the two Acts in 
greater detail and clarity. Under the Kerala Act, against an order passed by 
a Rent Control Court presided over by a District Munsif, the aggrieved 
party is conferred a right of appeal under Section 18. The Appellate 
Authority has to be a judicial officer not below the rank of a subordinate 
Judge. The appellate Authority has been conferred powers co-extensive 
with those of the Rent Control Court but having over-riding effect. Having 
these factors in mind, the Legislature has declared that in so far as an 
order of a Rent Control Court is concerned it shall be final subject only to 
any modification or revision by an Appellate Authority, and in so far as the 
Appellate Authority is concerned, its decision shall be final and shall not be 
liable to be called in question in any Court of law except as provided in 
Section 20. As regards Section 29, a division of the powers of revision 
87 
Page 87 
192 
exercisable thereunder has been made between the High Court and the 
District Court. In all those cases where a revision is preferred against a 
decision of an Appellate Authority of the rank of a Subordinate Judge 
under Section 18, the District Judge has been constituted the revisional 
authority. It is only in other cases i.e. where the decision sought to be 
revised is that of a judicial officer of a higher rank than a Subordinate 
Judge, the High Court has been constituted the Revisional authority. The 
revisional powers conferred under Section 20, whether it be on the District 
Judge or the High Court as the case may be are of greater amplitude than 
the powers of revision exercisable by a High Court under 
Section 115 Code of Civil Procedure Under Section 20 the Revisional 
Authority is entitled to satisfy itself about the legality regularity, or propriety 
of the orders sought to be revised. Not only that, the Appellate Authority 
and the Revisional Authority have been expressly conferred powers of 
remand under Section 20A of the Act. Therefore, a party is afforded an 
opportunity to put forth his case before the Rent Control Court and then 
before the Appellate Authority and there after if need be before the Court 
of Revision viz. the District Court if the Appellate Authority is of the rank of 
a Subordinate Judge. The Legislature in its wisdom has thought that on 
account of the ample opportunity given to a party to put forth his case 
before three courts, viz. the Trial Court, the Appellate Court and the 
Revisional Court, there was no need to make the revisional order of the 
District Court subject to further scrutiny by the High Court by means of a 
second revision either under the Act or under the Code of Civil Procedure. 
It has been pointed out in Aundal Ammal's case (supra) that the full Bench 
of the Kerala High Court had failed to construe the terms of 
Section 20 read with Section 18(51 in their proper perspective and this 
failing had effected its conclusion According to the Full Bench, a revisional 
order of a District, Court under Section 20 laid itself open for further 
challenge to the High Court under Section115 Code of Civil Procedure 
because of two factors viz. (1) there was no mention in the Act that the 
order would be final and (2) there was no provision in the Act for an appeal 
being filed against a revisional order under Section 20. The full Bench 
failed to notice certain crucial factors. In the first place, Section 20 is a 
composite section and refers to the powers of revision exercisable under 
that Section by a District Judge as well as by the High Court. Such being 
the case if it is to be taken that an order passed by a District Court under 
Section 20 will not have finality because the Section does not specifically 
say so, then it will follow that a revisional order passed by the High Court 
under Section 20 (11 also will not have finality Surely it cannot be 
contended by anyone that an order passed by a High Court in exercise of 
its powers of revision under Section 20 (1) can be subjected to further 
revision because Section 20(1) has not expressly conferred finality to an 
order passed under that Section. Secondly, the terms of Section 20 
111 have to be read in conjunction with Section 18(51. Section 18(5) as 
SS 
Page 0 
— 189 — 
already seen, declares that an order of a Rent Control Court shall be final 
subject to the decision of the Appellate Authority and an order of an 
Appellate Authority shall be final and shall not be liable to be called in 
question in any court of law except as provided for in Section 20. When the 
Legislature has declared that even an order of the Rent Control Court and 
the decision of the Appellate Authority shall be final at their respective 
stages unless the order is modified by the Appellate Authority or the 
Revisional Authority as the case may be, there is no necessity for the 
legislature to declare once ever again that an order passed in revision 
under Section 20(1) by the District Judge or the High Court as the case 
may be will also have the seal of finality. The third aspect is that the 
Legislature has not merely conferred finality to the decision of an Appellate 
Authority but has further laid down that the decision shall not be liable to 
be called in question in any court of law except as provided for in 
Section 20. These additional words clearly spell out the prohibition or 
exclusion of a second revision under Section 115 Code of Civil Procedure 
to the High Court against a revisional order passed by a District Court 
under Section 20 of the Act. This position has been succinctly set out in 
para 20 of the judgment in Aundal Ammal's case (supra). As was noticed 
in Vishesh Kumar's case, the intent behind the bifurcation of the jurisdiction 
is to reduce the number of revision petitions filed in the High Court and for 
determining the legislative intent, the Court must as far as possible 
construe a statute in such a manner as would advance the object of the 
legislation and suppress the mischief sought to be cured by it.'' 
43. 	
Most importantly, a nine-Judge constitution bench judgment of this Court, 
in Mafatlal Industries v. Union of India (1997) 5 SCC 536, while dealing with the 
validity of Section 11 B(3) of the Excise Act, held as follows: 
"77. Hereinbefore, we have referred to the provisions relating to refund 
obtaining from time to time under the Central Excise and Salt Act. Whether 
it is Rule 11 (as it stood from time to time) or Section 11-B (as it obtained 
before 1991 or subsequent thereto), they invariably purported to be 
exhaustive on the question of refund. Rule 11, as in force prior to August 
6, 1977, stated that "no duties and charges which have been paid or have 
been adjusted„.shall be refunded unless the claimant makes an 
application for such refund under his signature and lodges it to the proper 
officers within three months from the date of such payment or adjustment, 
as the case may be". Rule 11, as in force between 6.8.1977 and 
1T11.1980 contained Sub-rule (4) which expressly declared : "(4) Save as 
otherwise provided by or under this rule, no claim of refund of any duty 
shall be entertained". Section 11-B as in force prior to April, 1991 
contained Sub-section (4) in identical words. It said : "(4) Save as 
otherwise provided by or under this Act, no claim for refund of any duty of 
}39 
Page A9 
excise shall be entertained". Sub-section (5) was more specific and 
emphatic. It said: 
"Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law. the provisions  
of this Section shall also apply to a claim for refund of any amount  
collected as duty of excise made on the ground that the goods in  
respect of which such amount was collected were not excisable or  
were entitled to exemption from duty and no court shall have any  
jurisdiction in respect of such claim," 
It started with a non-obstante clause: it took in every kind of refund and 
every claim for refund and it expressly barred the jurisdiction of courts in 
respect of such claim. Sub-section (3) of Section 11-8 as it now stands. 
it's to the same effect - indeed, more comprehensive and all- 
encompassing. It says: 
"(3) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any  
judgment decree order or direction of the Appellate Tribunal or any  
court or in any other provision of this Act or the rules made  
thereunder or in any law for the time being in force no refund shall  
be made except as provided in sub-section". 
The language could not have been more specific and emphatic. The  
exclusivity of the provision relating to refund is not only express and  
unambi uous but is in addition to the eneral bar arisin from the fact that 
the Act creates new rights and liabilities and also provides forums and  
procedures for ascertaining and adiudicatinq those rights and liabilities and  
all other incidental and ancillary matters as will be pointed out presently.  
This is a bar upon a bar - an aspect emphasised in Para 23 (supra) and  
has  to be respected so long as t stands. The validity of these provisions  
has never been seriously doubted. Even though in certain writ petitions 
now before us, validity of the 1991 (Amendment) Act including the 
amended Section 11-B is ques ioned, no specific reasons have been 
assigned why a provision of the nature of Sub-section (3) of Section11 
B (amended) is unconstitutional. Applying the propositions enunciated by a 
seven-Judge Bench of this Court in Kamala Mills case, AIR 1965 SC 1942, 
it must be held that Section 11-B (both befo e and after amendment) is 
valid and constitutional. In Kamala Mills, this Court upheld the 
constitutional validity of Section 20 of the Bombay Sales Tax Act (set out 
hereinbefore) on the ground that the Bombay Act contained adequate 
provisions for refund, for appeal, revision, rectification of mistake and for 
condonation of delay in filing appeal/revision. The Court pointed out that  
had the Bombay Act not provided these remedies and vet barred the resort  
to civil court the constitutionality of Section 20 may have been in serious  
doubt. but since it does provide such remedies its validity was beyond  
challenge, to repeat - and it is necessary to do so - so long as Section 11-
B is constitutionally valid it has to be followed and given effect to. We can 
see no reason on which the constitutionality of the said provision - or a 
similar provision - can be doubted, It must also be remembered that  
90 
Page 90 
-19i - 
Central Excises and Salt Act is a special enactment creating new and  
special obligations and rights which at the same time prescribes the  
procedure for levy assessment collection refund and all other incidental  
and ancillary provisions. As pointed out in the Statement of Objects and 
Reasons appended to the Bill which became the Act the Act along with  
the Rules was intended to "form a coin Bete central excise code". The idea  
was "to consolidate in a sin  le enactment all the laws relatin to central 
duties of excise". The Act is a self-contained enactment. It contains 
provisions for collecting the taxes which are due according to law but have 
not been collected and also for refunding the taxes which have been 
collected contrary to law, viz., Sections 11-A and 11-B and its allied 
provisions. Both provisions contain a uniform rule of limitation, viz., six 
months, with an exception in ach case. Sections 11-A and 11-B are 
complimentary to each other. To such a situation. Proposition No. 3 
enunciated in Kamala Mills becomes applicable, viz., where a statute 
creates a special right or a liability and also provides the procedure for the 
determination of the right or liability by the Tribunals constituted in that 
behalf and provides further that all questions about the said right and 
liability shall be determined by the Tribunals so constituted, the resort to 
civil court is not available -except to the limited extent pointed out in 
Kamala Mills. Central Excise Act specifically provides for refund. It 
expressly declares that no refund shall be made except in accordance 
therewith. The jurisdiction of a civil Court is expressly barred - vide Sub-
section (5) of Section 11-B prior to its amendment in 1991, and Sub-
section (3) of Section 11-B as amended in 1991. It is relevant to notice  
that the Act provides for more than one appeal against the orders made  
under Section 11-B/Rule 11. Since 1981 an appeal is provided to this  
Court also from the orders of the Tribunal. While Tribunal is not a  
departmental organ. this Court is a civil court. In this view of the matter and  
the express and additional bar and exclusivity contained in Rule  
11/Section 11-B. at all points of fime, it must be held that any and every  
ground including the violation of the principles of natural justice and  
infraction of fundamental principles of iudicial procedure can be urged in  
these appeals obviating the necessity of a suit or a writ peftpn in 
'n matters 
 
relating to refund. Once the constitutionality of the provisions of the Act  
including the provisions relating to refund is beyond question they  
constitute "law" within the meaning of Article 265 of the Constitution. It 
follows that any action taken under and in accordance with the said 
provisions would be an action taken under the "authority of law'', within the 
meaning of Article 265. In the face of the express provision which  
expressly declares that no claim for refund of any duty shall be entertained  
except in accordance with the said provisions it is not permissible to resort  
to Section 72 of the Contract Act to do precisely that which is expressly  
prohibited by the said provisions. In other words it is not permissible to  
claim refund by invoking Section 72 as a separate and independent  
91 
Page 91 
-192- 
remedy when such a course is expressly barred by the provisions in the  
Act viz. Rule 11 and Section 11-8. For this reason a suit for refund would  
also not lie. Taking any other view would amount to nullifying the 
provisions in Rule 11/Section 11-13 which, it needs no emphasis, cannot 
be done. It, therefore, follows that any and every claim for refund of excise 
duty can be made only under and in accordance with Rule 11 or 
Section 11-8 as the case may be, in the forums provided by the Act. No 
suit can be filed for refund of duty invoking Section 72 of the Contract Act. 
So far as the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 - or for that  
matter the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 - is concerned. it is  
obvious that the provisions of the Act cannot bar and curtail these  
remedies. It is however equally obvious that while exercising the power  
under Article 226/Article 32 the Court would certainly take note of the  
gislative intent manifested in the provisions of the Act and would exercise  
their jurisdiction consistent with the provisions of the enactment." 
It was submitted, that a perusal of the above paragraph shows, that this Court 
noticed, that against the order of the tribunal an appeal was provided for to this 
Court. The Court declared, that the tribunal was not a departmental organ and 
the Supreme Court was a civil court as it was hearing a statutory appeal. More 
importantly it held, that every ground including violation and infraction of judicial 
procedure could be urged in these appeals, obviating the necessity of a suit or a 
writ petition in matters relating to refund. This Court took care to hold, that so far 
as the jurisdiction of High Courts under Article 226 or this Court under Article 32 
are concerned, they cannot he curtailed. It further held, that it was equally 
obvious that while exercising the power under Article 226/32 the Court would 
certainly take note of the legislative intent manifested In the provisions of the Act 
and would exercise their jurisdiction consistent with the provisions of the 
enactment. It was accordingly submitted, that in view of the conclusions drawn, 
in the above judgment, all the contentions urged by the petitioners, needed to be 
rejected.

The third contention: 
44. 	
Learned counsel for the respondents, vehemently controverted the 
submissions advanced at the hands of the petitioners, that the NTT Act was ultra 
vices the provisions of the Constitution. Insofar as the instant aspect of the 
matter is concerned, learned counsel for the respondents, first placed reliance on 
Article 246 of the Constitution. Article 246 is being extracted hereunder: 
°246. Subject-matter of laws made by Parliament and by the Legislatures 
of States — (1) 	
Notwithstanding anything in clauses (2) and (3), 
Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the 
matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution 
referred to as the "Union Usti). 
(2) 
Notwithstanding anything in clause (3), Parliament and, subject to 
clause (1), the Legislature of any State also, have power to make laws with 
respect to any of the matters enumerated in List Ill in the Seventh 
Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the "Concurrent List"). 
(3) 
Subject to clauses (1) and (2), the Legislature of any State has 
exclusive power to make laws for such State or any part thereof with 
respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule 
On this Constitution referred to as the 'State List). 
al 
Parliament has power to make laws with respect to any matter for 
any part of the territory of India not included (in  a State) notwithstanding 
that such matter is a matter enumerated in the State List." 
Based on the aforesaid provision, it was sought to be asserted that the 
Parliament had the unqualified and absolute jurisdiction, power and authority to 
enact laws in respect of matters enumerated in Lists I and HI of the Constitution. 
Additionally, placing reliance on Article 246(4), it was asserted, that even on 
subjects not expressly provided for in the three Lists of the Seventh Schedule to 
the Constitution, the Parliament still had the absolute and untrammeled right to 
enact legislation. Insofar as the instant aspect of the matter is concerned, 
Page 93 
learned counsel for the respondents placed reliance on entries 77 to 79, 82 to 84, 
95 and 97 of List I. The above entries are being extracted hereunder: 
List I — Union List 
Constitution, organisation, jurisdiction and powers of the Supreme 
Court (including contempt of such Court), and the fees taken therein; 
persons entitled to practise before the Supreme Court. 
78. 
Constitution and organisation (including vacations) of the High 
Courts except provisions as to officers and servants of High Courts; 
persons entitled to practise before the High Courts. 
79. 
Extension of the jurisdiction of a High Court to, and exclusion of the 
jurisdiction of a High Court from, any Union territory. 
82. 
Taxes on income other than agricultural income. 
83. 
Duties of customs including export duties. 
84. 
Duties of excise on tobacco and other goods manufactured or 
produced in India except — 
(a) 
alcoholic liquors for human consumption. 
(b) 
opium, Indian hemp and other narcotic drugs and narcotics, 
but including medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol or any 
substance included in sub-paragraph (b) of this entry. 
95. 	
Jurisdiction and powers of all courts, except the Supreme Court, with 
respect to any of the matters in this List; admiralty jurisdiction. 
97. 	
Any other matter not enumerated in List II or List III including any tax 
not mentioned in either of those Lists: 
Based on the entries reproduced hereinabove, especially entries 77 to 79, it was 
submitted, that Parliament had the jurisdiction to enact legislation even in respect 
of the Supreme Court and the High Courts. Additionally, it had the power to 
legislate, and thereby, to extend or exclude the jurisdiction of a High Court. 
Relying on entries 82 to 84, it was the submission of the learned counsel for the 
respondents, that on matters of income-tax, customs duty and excise duty, the 
power to legislate was unequivocally vested with the Parliament. Reliance was 
placed on entry 95, to contend, that the extent of the jurisdiction of all courts 
including the High Court, in respect of matters expressed in List I could also be 
laid down by the Parliament. Referhng again to entries 82 to 84 it was submitted. 
94 
Page 99 
195r 
that the extension or exclusion of jurisdiction on tax matters, was also within the 
domain of Parliament. So as to assert, that in case this Court was of the view, 
that the subject of the legislation contained in the NTT Act did not find mention, in 
any of the three Lists of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, the 
submission on behalf of the respondents was, that Parliament would still have 
the authority to legislate thereon, under entry 97 contained in List I of the 
Seventh Schedule. 
45. Learned counsel for the respondents, also placed reliance on entries 
11A and 46 contained in List Ill of Seventh Schedule. The above entries are 
being extracted hereunder: 
List Ill — Concurrent List  
"11A. Administration of justice: constitution and organisation of all courts, 
except the Supreme Court and the High Courts. 
xxx 	
xxx 	
xxx 
46. Jurisdiction and powers of all courts, except the Supreme Court. with 
respect to any of the matters in this List." 
Referring to the above entries, it was the contention of the learned counsel for 
the respondents that Parliament had the authority to enact legislation, in respect 
of the extent of jurisdiction and powers of courts, including the High Court. It 
was, however pointed out, that this power extended only to such matters and 
subjects, that found mention in List III of the Seventh Schedule. It was, therefore, 
that reliance was placed on entry 11A in List Ill, to contend that administration of 
justice, constitution and organization of all courts (except the Supreme Court and 
the High Courts) would lead to the inevitable conclusion that the NIT Act was 
promulgated, well within the power vested with the Parliament, under Article 
246(2) of the Constitution. 
95 
Page 95 
196--  
46. Additionally, reliance was placed by the learned counsel for the 
respondents, on Article 247 of the Constitution, which is reproduced hereunder: 
"247. Power of Parliament to provide for the establishment of certain 
additional courts. - Notwithstanding anything in this Chapter, Parliament 
may by law provide for the establishment of any additional courts for the 
better administration of laws made by Parliament or of any existing laws 
with respect to a matter enumerated in the Union List." 
Referring to the above provision, it was the assertion of the learned counsel for 
the respondents, that power was expressly vested with the Parliament, to 
establish additional courts, for better administration of laws. It was submitted, 
that this was exactly what the Parliament had chosen to do, while enacting the 
NTT Act. Referring to the objects and reasons. indicating the basis of the 
enactment of the NTT Act. it was the categoric assertion at the hands of the 
learned counsel, that the impugned enactment was promulgated with the clear 
understanding, that the NTT would provide better adjudication of legal issues, 
arising out of direct/indirect tax laws. 
47. 	
Besides Articles 246 and 247 of the Constitution, learned counsel for the 
respondents asserted, that Articles 323A and 323B were inserted into the 
Constitution. by the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976. The 
above provisions were included in the newly enacted Part XIV A of the 
Constitution. It was asserted, that the instant amendment of the Constitution was 
made for achieving two objectives. Firstly, to exclude the power of judicial review 
of the High Courts and the Supreme Court, totally. Thus excluding judicial review 
in its entirety. And secondly, to create independent specialized tribunals, with 
power of judicial review, which would ease the burden of the High Courts and the 
96 
Page 96 
_ )97- 
 
Supreme Court. It was however acknowledged by learned counsel representing 
the respondents, that the first of the above mentioned objectives, was interpreted 
by this Court in L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India (1997) 3 SCC 261, which 
struck down clause (2)(d) of Article 323A and clause (3)(d) of Article 323B, to the 
extent the amended provisions introduced by the Forty-second Amendment to 
the Constitution, excluded the jurisdiction of the High Courts and the Supreme 
Court under Articles 226/227 and 32/136 respectively. Insofar as the second 
objective is concerned, placing reliance in L. Chandra Kumar case (supra), it was 
the contention of the learned counsel for the respondents, that this Court had 
clearly concluded, that as long as the power of judicial review continue with the 
High Courts and the Supreme Court, under the provisions referred to 
hereinabove, the enactment under reference would be constitutionally valid. 
Therefore, in response to the submissions advanced at the hands of the learned 
counsel for the petitioners (as have been noticed hereinabove), it was the 
contention of the learned counsel for the respondents, that the power to enact 
the NH Act, was clearly vested with the Parliament even under Article 323B of 
the Constitution. Furthermore, since the impugned enactment did not exclude 
the jurisdiction of the High Courts under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, 
and also, did not exclude the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Articles 32 
and 136 of the Constitution, the challenge to the constitutional validity of the NTT 
Act was wholly unjustified. 
48. Learned counsel for the respondents was at pains to emphasise, that the 
jurisdictional road of Courts, as final interpreter of the law, was clearly preserved. 
97

Firstly, because a statutory appeal was provided for under the NTT Act to the 
Supreme Court. And secondly because, judicial review vested in the High Courts 
under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution. and in the Supreme Court under 
Articles 32 and 136 of the Constitution, had been kept intact. It is, therefore, the 
submission of the learned counsel for the respondents, that no fault can be found 
in the vesting of appellate jurisdiction from orders passed by Appellate Tribunals 
(constituted under the Income Tax Act, Customs Act and the Excise Act) with the 
NTT 
49. 	
While acknowledging the fact, that the jurisdiction vested in the High 
Courts to hear appeals from the Appellate Tribunals, under the Income Tax Act 
(vide Section 260A), the Customs Act (vide Section 130), and the Excise Act 
(vide Section 35G), has been transferred from the jurisdictional High Court to the 
NTT, it was submitted that appellate jurisdiction vested in a High Court under a 
statute, could be taken away by an amendment of the statute. Stated simply, the 
submission at the behest of the respondents was, whatever is vested by a 
statutory enactment, can likewise be divested in the same manner. It was 
therefore sought to be asserted, that the grounds of challenge to the NTT Act 
raised, at the behest of the petitioners, were misconceived and unacceptable. 
50. Besides the submissions noticed hereinabove, it was also contended on 
behalf of the respondents, that th'e assertion made by the petitioners, that 
appellate jurisdiction on "substantial questions of lawn could not be vested with 
the NTT, was fallacious. In this behalf, it was sought to be reiterated, that 
jurisdiction of civil courts (including the original side of the High Court) was 
9S 
Page 98 
-199- 
barred in respect of tax related issues. It was sought to be explained, that a case 
could involve questions of fact, as well as, questions of law right from the stage 
of the initial adjudicatory authority. But, it was pointed out, that only cases 
involving "substantial questions of law' would qualify for adjudication at the hands 
of the NTT. As such, placing reliance on the decision in Mafatlal Industries Ltd. 
v. Union of India (1997) 5 SCC 536, it was submitted, that the above contention 
raised by the petitioners had no legs to stand. Furthermore, it was sought to be 
pointed out, that the phrase "substantial questions of law" has been interpreted 
by this Court to mean, not only questions of general pubic importance, but also 
questions which would directly and substantially affect the rights of the parties to 
the litigation. It was also asserted, that a question of law would also include, a 
legal issue not previously settled, subject to the condition, that it had a material 
bearing on the determination of the controversy to be settled, between the 
parties. It is accordingly contended, that no limited interpretation could be placed 
on the term "substantial questions of law". Accordingly, it was submitted, that a 
challenge to the constitution of the NTT on the premise that the NTT was vested 
with the jurisdiction to settle "substantial questions of law' was unsustainable. 
51. 	
In order to support his above submission, learned counsel for the 
respondents placed emphatic reliance on a few judgments rendered by this 
Court. The same are being noticed hereunder: 
(i) 	
Reliance was also placed on L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India, (1997) 3 
SCC 261. Learned counsel for the respondents, while relying on the instant 
judgment, made a reference to various observations recorded therein. We wish 
99 
Page 99 
to incorporate hereunder all the paragraphs on which reliance was placed by the 
learned counsel,- 
"80. However it is important to emphasise that though the subordinate  
judiciary or Tribunals created under ordinary legislations cannot exercise  
the power of judicial review of legislative action to the exclusion of the High  
Courts and the Supreme Court there is no constitutional prohibition  
against their performing a supplemental — as opposed to a substitutional  
— role in this respect. That such a situation is contemplated within the  
constitutional scheme becomes evident when one analyses clause (31 of  
Article 32 of the Constitution which reads as under 
"32. Remedies for enforcement of tights conferred by this Part— 
(3) 	
Without preludice to the powers conferred on the Supreme  
Court b clauses 1 and 2 Parliament ma b law em•ower 
other court to exercise within the local limits of its jurisdiction all or 
any of the Dowers exercisable by the Supreme Court under clause  
(2):  
81. If the power under Article 32 of the Constitution which has been  
described as the "heat and "soul" of the Constitution can be additionally  
conferred upon "any other court' there is no reason why the same  
situation cannot subsist in respect of the jurisdiction conferred upon the  
High Courts under Article 226 of the Constitution. So long as the  
jurisdiction of the High Courts under Articles 226/227 and that of this Court 
 
under Article 32 is retained there is no reason why the power to test the  
validity of legislations against the provisions of the Constitution cannot be  
conferred upon Administrative Tribunals created under the Act or upon  
Tribunals created under Article 323-B of the Constitution. It is to be  
remembered that, apart from the authorisation that flows from Articles 323-
A and 323-B both Parliament and the State Legislatures possess  
legislative competence to effect changes in the original iurisdiction of the  
Supreme Court and the High Courts. This power is available to Parliament  
under Entries 77 78. 79 and 95 of List I and to the State Legislatures  
under Entry 65 of List lh Entry 46 of List Ill can also be availed of both by  
Parliament and the State Legislatures for this purpose. 
82. There are pressing reasons why we are anxious to preserve the 
conferment of such a power on these Tribunals. When the Framers of our 
Constitution bestowed the powers of judicial review of legislative action 
upon the High Courts and the Supreme Court. they ensured that other 
constitutional safeguards were created to assist them in effectively 
discharging this onerous burden. The expectation was that this power 
would be required to be used only occasionally. However, in the five 
decades that have ensued since Independence, the quantity of litigation 
100 
Page 100 
before the High Courts has exploded in an unprecedented manner. The 
decision in Sampan? Kumar's case, AIR 1987 SC 386, was rendered 
against such a backdrop. We are conscious of the fact that when a 
Constitution Bench of this Court in Sampath Kumar's case (supra) adopted 
the theory of alternative institutional mechanisms, it was attempting to 
remedy an alarming practical situation and the approach selected by it 
appeared to be most appropriate to meet the exigencies of the time. Nearly 
a decade later, we are now in a position to review the theoretical and 
practical results that have arisen as a consequence of the adoption of such 
an approach. 
83. 
We must, at this stage, focus upon the factual position which 
occasioned the adoption of the theory of alternative institutional 
mechanisms in Sampath Kornai's case (supra). In his leading judgment, R. 
Misra, J. refers to the fact that since Independence, the population 
explosion and the increase in litigation had greatly increased the burden of 
pendency in the High Courts. Reference was made to studies conducted 
towards relieving the High Courts of their increased load. In this regard, the 
recommendations of the Shah Committee for setting up independent 
Tribunals as also the suggestion of the Administrative Reforms 
Commission that Civil Service Tribunals be set up, were noted. Reference 
was also made to the decision in K.K. Dutta v. Union of India, (1980) 4 
SCC 38, where this Court had, while emphasising the need for speedy 
resolution of service disputes, proposed the establishment of Service 
Tribunals. 
84. 
The problem of clearing the backlogs of High Courts, which has 
reached colossal proportions in our times is, nevertheless, one that has 
been the focus of study for close to a half century. Over time, several 
Expert Committees and Commissions have analysed the intricacies 
involved and have made suggestions, not all of which have been 
consistent. Of the several studies that have been conducted in this regard, 
as many as twelve have been undertaken by the Law Commission of India 
(hereinafter referred to as 'the LCI'') or similar high-level committees 
appointed by the Central Government, and are particularly noteworthy.

65. An appraisal of the daunting task which confronts the High Courts 
can be made by referring to the assessment undertaken by the LCI in its 
124th Report which was released sometime after the judgment in Sampath 
Kumars case (supra). The Report was delivered in 1988, nine years ago, 
and some changes have occurred since, but the broad perspective which 
emerges is still, by and large, true: 
... The High Courts enjoy civil as well as criminal, ordinary as well 
as extraordinary, and general as well as special jurisdiction. The 
source of the jurisdiction is the Constitution and the various statutes 
as well as letters patent and other instruments constituting the High 
Courts. The High Courts in the country enjoy an original jurisdiction 
in respect of testamentary, matrimonial and guardianship matters. 
Original jurisdiction is conferred on the High Courts under the 
Representation of the People Act, 1951, Companies Act. 1956, and 
several other special statutes. The High Courts, being courts of 
record, have the power to punish for its contempt as well as 
contempt of its subordinate courts. The High Courts enjoy 
extraordinary jurisdiction under Articles 226 and 227 of the 
Constitution enabling it to issue prerogative writs, such as, the one in 
the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto 
and certiorari. Over and above this, the High Courts of Bombay, 
Calcutta. Delhi, Himachal Pradesh. Jammu and Kashmir and 
Madras also exercise ordinary original civil jurisdiction. The High 
Courts also enjoy advisory jurisdiction, as evidenced by Section 256 
of the Indian Companies Act, 1956, Section 27 of the Wealth Tax 
Act, 1957, Section 26 of the Gift Tax Act, 1958, and Section 18 of 
the Companies (Profits) Surtax Act, 1964. Similarly, there are 
parallel provisions conferring advisory jurisdiction on the High 
Courts, such as, Section 130 of the Customs Act, 1962, and Section 
354 of the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944. The H'gh Courts have 
also enjoyed jurisdiction under the Indian Divorce Ac , 1869, and the 
Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936. Different types of litigation 
coming before the High Court in exercise of its wide urisdiction bear 
different names. The vast area of jurisdiction can be appreciated by 
reference to those names, viz., (a) first appeals; (b) appeals under 
the letters patent; (c) second appeals; (d) revision petitions; (e) 
criminal appeals: (t) criminal revisions; (g) civil and criminal 
references; (h) writ petitions; (i) writ appeals; (0 references under 
direct and indirect tax laws; (k) matters arising under the Sales Tax 
Act; (I) election petitions under the Representation of the People Act; 
(m) petitions under the Companies Act, Banking Companies Act and 
other special Acts and (n) wherever the High Court has original 
jurisdiction, suits and other proceedings in exercise of that 
jurisdiction. This varied jurisdiction has to some extent been 
102 
Page 102 
A03- 
responsible for a very heavy institution of matters in the High 
Courts." 
86. 
After analysing the situation existing in the High Courts at length, the 
LCI made specific recommendations towards the establishment of 
specialist Tribunals thereby lending force to the approach adopted in 
Sampath Kumar's case (supra). The LCI noted the erstwhile international 
judicial trend which pointed towards generalist courts yielding their place to 
specialist Tribunals. Describing the pendency in the High Courts as 
"catastrophic, crisis-ridden, almost unmanageable, imposing ... an 
immeasurable burden on the system", the LCI stated that the prevailing 
view in indian Jurisprudence that the jurisdiction enjoyed by the High Court 
is a holy cow required a review. It, therefore, recommended the trimming of 
the jurisdiction of the High Courts by setting up specialist courts/Tribunals 
While simultaneously eliminating the jurisdiction of the High Courts. 
87. 
It is important to realise that though the theory of alternative 
institutional mechanisms was propounded in Sampath Kumaes case 
(supra) in respect of the Administrative Tribunals, the concept itself — that 
of creating alternative modes of dispute resolution which would relieve 
High Courts of their burden while simultaneously providing specialised 
ustice — is not new. In fact, the issue of having a specialised tax court has 
been discussed for several decades; though the Report of the High Court 
Arrears Committee (1972) dismissed it as Ill-conceived", the WI, in its 
115th Report (1986) revived the recommendation of setting up separate 
Central Tax Courts. Similarly, other Reports of the LCI have suggested the 
selling up of tram Nyayalayas' [LCI, 114th Report (1986)]. 
Industrial/Labour Tribunals [LCI, 122nd Report (1987)] and Education 
Tribunals [LCI, 123rd Report (1987)]. 
88. 
In R.K. Jain's case 11993) AIR SCW 1899 this Court had in order  
to understand how the theory of alternative institutional mechanisms had  
functioned in practice. recommended that the LCI or a similar expert body  
should conduct a survey of the functioning of these Tribunals. It was hoped  
that such a study conducted after gauging the working of the Tribunals  
over a sizeable period of more than five years would provide an answer to  
the questions posed by the critics of the theory. Unfortunately we do not  
have the benefit of such a study. We may. however advert to the Report of 
the Arrears Committee (1989-90). popularly known as the Malimath  
Committee Report which has elaborately dealt with the aspect. The  
observations contained in the Report to this extent they contain a review  
of the functioning of the Tribunals over a period of three years or so after  
their institution will be useful for our purpose. Chapter VIII of the second 
volume of the Report, "Alternative Modes and Forums for Dispute 
Resolution", deals with the issue at length. After forwarding its specific 
recommendations on the feasibility of setting up 'Gram Nyayalayas'. 
Industrial Tribunals and Educational Tribunals. the Committee has dealt 
with the issue of Tribunals set up under Articles 323-A and 323-B of the 
103 
Page 103 
Constitution. The relevant observations in this regard, being of 
considerable significance to our analysis, are extracted in full as under: 
"Functioning of Tribunals 
8.63 Several tribunals are functioning in the country. Not all of 
them however have inspired confidence in the public mind. The  
reasons are not far to seek. The foremost is the lack of competence  
objectivity and iudicial approach The next is their constitution the  
power and method of appointment of personnel thereto the inferior 
status and the casual method of working. The last is their actual  
composition' men of calibre are not willing to be appointed as  
presiding officers in view of the uncertainty of tenure unsatisfactory  
conditions of service executive subordination in matters of_ 
 
administration and political interference in judicial functioninc  For 
these and other reasons, the quality of justice is stated to have 
suffered and the cause of expedition is not found to have been 
served by the establishment of such tribunals. 
8.64 Even the experiment of setting up of the Administrative  
Tribunals under the Administrative Tribunals Act 1985 has not been  
widely welcomed. Its members have been selected from all kinds of  
services including the Indian Police Service. The decision of the 
State Administrative Tribunals are not appealable except under 
Article 136 of the Constitution. On account of the heavy cost and 
remoteness of the forum, there is virtual negation of the right of 
appeal. This has led to denial of justice in many cases and 
consequential dissatisfaction. There appears to be a move in some 
of the States where they have been established for their abolition. 
Tribunals—Tests for Including High Courts Jurisdiction 
8.65 A Tribunal which substitutes the High Court as an alternative  
institutional mechanism for iudicial review must be no less  
efficacious than the High Court. Such a tribunal must inspire  
confidence and public esteem that it is a highly competent and  
expert mechanism with iudicial approach and obiectivitv. What is 
needed in a tribunal which is intended to supplant the High Court. is  
legal [minim, and experience and judicial acumen eouipment and  
approach. When such a tribunal is composed of personnel drawn  
from the iudiciary as well as from services or from amongst experts  
in the field any weightage in favour of the service members or  
expert members and value-discounting the iudicial members would  
render the tribunal less effective and efficacious than the High Court. 
The Act setting up such a tribunal would itself have to be declared 
as void under such circumstances. The same would not at all be 
conducive to judicial independence and may even tend, directly or 
indirectly, to influence their decision-making process, especially 
when the Government is a litigant in most of the cases coming 
before such tribunal. (See S.P. Sampath Kumes case (supra)). 
104 
Page 104 
The protagonists of specialist tribunals, who simultaneously with 
their establishment want exclusion of the writ jurisdiction of the High 
Courts in regard to matters entrusted for adjudication to such 
tribunals, ought not to overlook these vital and important aspects. It 
must not be forgotten that what is permissible to be supplanted by 
another equally effective and efficacious institutional mechanism is 
the High Courts and no the judicial review itself. Tribunals are not 
an end in themselves but a means to an end; even if the laudable 
objectives of speedy jus ice, uniformity of approach, predictability of 
decisions and specialist ustice are to be achieved, the framework of 
the tribunal intended to be set up to attain them must still retain its 
basic judicial character and inspire public confidence. Any scheme 
of decentralisation of administration of justice providing for an 
alternative institutional mechanism in substitution of the High Courts 
must pass the aforesaid test in order to be constitutionally valid. 
8.66 The overall picture regarding the tribunalisation of iustice in  
our country is not satisfactory and encouraging. There is a need for  
a fresh look and review and a serious consideration before the  
g_p
c  ailment is extended to new areas of fields especially if the  
onstitutional jurisdiction of the Hion Courts is to be simultaneously. 
ousted. Not many tribunals satisfying the aforesaid tests can  
possibly be established." 
Having expressed itself in this manner, the Malimath Committee 
specifically recommended that the theory of alternative institutional 
mechanisms be abandoned. Instead, it recommended that institutional 
changes be carried out within the High Courts, dividing them into separate 
divisions for different branches of law, as is being done in England. It 
stated that appointing more Judges to man the separate divisions while 
using the existing infrastructure would be a better way of remedying the 
problem of pendency in the High Courts. 
89. 	
In the years that have passed since the Report of the Malimath 
Committee was delivered, the pendency in the High Courts has 
substantially increased and we are of the view that its recommendation is 
not suited to our present context. That the various Tribunals have not  
performed up to expectations is a self-evident and widely acknowledged  
truth. However to draw an inference that their unsatisfactory performance  
points to their being founded on a fundamentally unsound principle would  
not be correct. The reasons for which the Tribunals were consttuted still  
persist. indeed those reasons have become even more pronounced in our  
times. We have already indicated that our constitutional scheme permits  
the ttin  up of such Tribunals. However. drastic measures may have to  
be resorted to in order to elevate their standards to ensure that they stand  
up to constitutional scrutiny in the discharge of the power of judicial review  
conferred upon them  
105 
Page 105 
,_. 0,3)8 -- 
90. 
We may first address the issue of exclusion of the power of judicial 
review of the High Courts. We have already held that in respect of the  
power of iudicial review. the jurisdiction of the High Courts under Articles  
226/227 cannot be excluded. It has been contended before us that the  
Tribunals shofld not be allowed to adiudicate upon matters where the vires  
of legislations is Questioned and that they should restrict themselves to  
handling matters where constitutional issues are not raised. We cannot  
bring ourselves to agree to this proposition as that may result in splitting up  
proceedings and play cause avoidable delay. If such a view were to be  
adopted it would be open for litigants to raise constitutional issues many  
of which may be quite frivolous to directly approach the High Courts and  
thus subvert the urisdiction of the Tribunals. Moreover even in these  
special branches of law some areas do involve the consideration of  
constitutional questions on a regular basis' for instance in service law  
matters. a large majority of cases involve an interpretation of Articles 14  
15 and 16 of the Constitution. To hold that the Tribunals have no power to  
handle matters involving constitutional issues would not serve the purpose  
for which they were constituted. On the other hand to hold that all such  
decisions will be subiect to the jurisdiction of the High Courts under  
Articles 226/227 of the Constitution before a Division Bench of the High  
Court within whose territorial jurisdiction the Tribunal concerned falls will  
serve two purposes. While saving the power of ludicial review of legislative  
action vested in the High Courts under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution  
it will ensure that frivolous claims are filtered out through the process of  
adiudication in the Tribunal. The High Court will also have the benefit of a  
reasoned decision on merits which will be of use to it in finally deciding the  
matter.  
91. 
It has also been contended before us that even in dealing with cases 
which are properly before the Tribunals, the manner in which justice is 
dispensed by them leaves much to be desired. Moreover, the remedy 
provided in the parent statutes, by way of an appeal by special leave under 
Article 136 of the Constitution, is too costly and inaccessible for it to be real 
and effective. Furthermore, the result of providing such a remedy is that 
the docket of the Supreme Court is crowded with decisions of Tribunals 
that are challenged on relatively trivial grounds and it is forced to perform 
the role of a first appellate court. We have already emphasised the  
necessity for ensuring that the High Courts are able to exercise judicial  
su  erintendence over the decisions of the Tribunals under Article 227 of  
the Constitution. In Pi!. Jain's case (supra) after taking note of these  
facts it was suggested that the possibility of an appeal from the Tribunal  
on Questions of law to a Division Bench of a High Court within whose  
territorial iurisdiction the Tribunal falls be pursued. it appears that no  
follow-up action has been taken pursuant to the suggestion. Such a  
measure would have improved matters considerably. Having regard to  
both the aforestated contentions we hold that all decisions of Tribunals  
106 
Page 106 
whether created pursuant to Article 323-A or Article 323-B of the  
Constitution will be subject to the High Court's writ jurisdiction under  
Articles 226/227 of the Constitution before a Division Bench of the High  
Court within whose territorial jurisdiction the particular Tribunal falls. 
92. 
We may add here that under the existing system, direct appeals  
have been provided from the decisions of all Tribunals to the Supreme  
Court under Article 136 of the Constitution. In view of our above-mentioned  
observations this situation will also stand modified. In the view that we  
have taken. no appeal from the decision of a Tribunal will directly lie before  
the Supreme Court under Article 136 of the Constitution' but instead the  
aggrieved party will be entitled to move the High Court under Articles  
226/227 of the Constitution and from the decision of the Division Bench of  
the High Court the aggrieved party could move this Court under Article 136  
of the Constitution. 
93. 
Before moving on to other aspects we may summarise our  
conclusions on the jurisdictional powers of these Tribunals. The Tribunals  
are competent to hear matters where the vires of statutory provisions are  
Questioned. However in discharging this dub/ they cannot act as  
substitutes for the High Courts and the Supreme Court which have under  
our constitutional set-up. been specifically entrusted with such an  
obligation. Their function in this respect is only supplementary and all such  
decisions of the Tribunals will be subject to scrutiny before a Division  
Bench of the respective High Courts. The Tribunals will consequently also  
have the power to test the vires of subordinate legislations and rules.  
However this power of the Tribunals will be subiect to one important  
exception. The Tribunals shall not entertain any Question regarding the  
vires of their parent statutes following the settled principle that a Tribunal  
which is a creature of an Act cannot declare that very Act to be  
unconstitutional. In such cases alone the High Court concerned may be  
approached directly. All other decisions of these Tribunals, rendered in 
cases that they are specifically empowered to adjudicate upon by virtue of 
their parent statutes, will also be subject to scrutiny before a Division 
Bench of their respective High Courts. We may add that the Tribunals will  
however continue to act as the only courts of first instance in respect of  
the areas of law for which they have been constituted. By this. we mean  
that it will not be open for litigants to directly approach the High Courts  
even in cases where they question the vires of statutory legislations  
(except as mentioned where the legislation which creates the particular  
Tribunal is challenged) by overlooking the iurisdiction of the concerned  
Tribunal. 
 
94. 
The directions issued by us in respect of making the decisions of  
Tribunals amenable to scrutiny before a Division Bench of the respective  
High Courts will however come into effect prospectively i.e. will apply to  
decisions rendered hereafter. To maintain the sanctity of judicial  
I07

AD  
roceedin s we have invoked the doctrine of ros ective overrulin so as 
not to disturb the •o d re in relation to decisions 	
rendered." 
Based an the decisions of this Court referred to above, it was the contention of 
the learned counsel for the respondents, that the submissions advanced on 
behalf of the petitioners, are liable to outright rejection. 
(ii) 	
Reliance was placed first of all on Union of India v. Delhi High Court Bar 
Association, (2002) 4 SCC 275. Insofar as the controversy raised in the instant 
judgment is concerned, it would be relevant to mention, that banks and financial 
institutions had been experiencing considerable difficulties in recovery of loans, 
and enforcement of securities. The procedure for recovery of debts due to banks 
and financial institutions, which was being followed, had resulted in the funds 
being blocked. To remedy the above situation, Parliament enacted the Recovery 
of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993. The Act, inter aha, 
provided for establishment of tribunals and Appellate Tribunals. The said 
tribunals were given jurisdiction, powers and authority, to entertain and decide, 
applications from banks and financial institutions, for recovery of debts, due to 
banks and financial institutions. The Appellate Tribunal, was vested with the 
jurisdiction and authority, to entertain appeals. The procedure to be followed by 
the tribunals, as also, the Appellate Tribunals, was provided for under the above 
enactment. The legislation also provided for modes of recovery of debts through 
Recovery Officers (appointed under the Act)- The constitutional validity of the 
Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 was raised 
on the ground, that the legislation was unreasonable and violative of Article 14 of 
the Constitution. It was also the claim of those who raised the said challenge, 
108 
Page 108 
that the enactment was beyond the legislative competence of the Parliament. 
The controversy came to be examined, in the first instance, by the Delhi High 
Court (in Delhi High Court Bar Association v. Union of India, AIR 1975 Delhi 
323). The Delhi High Court held, that even though the tribunal could be 
constituted by the Parliament, and even though the constitution of the tribunal 
was within the purview of Articles 323A and 3238 of the Constitution, and despite 
the fact that, the expression "administration of justice" appearing in entry 11A of 
List III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, would also include tribunals 
administering justice., yet the impugned Act was unconstitutional, as it had the 
effect of eroding the independence of the judiciary, besides being irrational, 
discriminatory, unreasonable and arbitrary. As such it was held, that the 
provisions of the enactment were violative of the mandate contained in Article 14 
of the Constitution. 	
The High Court, in its judgment, also quashed the 
appointment of Presiding Officers of the tribunal. While adjudicating upon the 
above controversy in reference to some of the issues that have been raised 
before us, our pointed attention was invited to the following observations' 
	
 Sub-section (20) of Section 19 provides that after giving the 
applicant and the defendant an opportunity of being heard, the Tribunal 
may pass such interim or final order as it thinks fit to meet the ends of 
justice. It is after this order that a certificate is issued by the Presiding 
Officer to the Recovery Officer for recovery of money. Section 22 of the Act 
has not been amended. Therefore  reading Secfions 19 and 22 of the Act 
together. it appears that the Tribunal and the Appellate Tribunal are to be  
guided by the principles of natural iustice while trying the matter before  
them. Section 22(1) of the Act stipulates that the Tribunal and the 
Appellate Tribunal, while being guided by the principles of natural justice, 
are to be subjected to the other provisions of the Act and the Rules. Rule  
12(7) provides that if a defendant denies his liability to pay the claim made  
by the applicant the Tribunal may act upon the affidavit of the applicant  
109 
Page 109 
who is acquainted with the facts of the case. In this Rule which deals with  
the consideration of the applicant's bank application. there is no reference  
to the examination of witnesses. This sub-rule refers only to the affidavit of  
the applicant. Rule 12(61 on the other hand. provides that the Tribunal  
may at any time for sufficient reason order a fact to be proved by affidavit  
or may pass an order that the affidavit of any witness may be read at the  
hearing. It is in the proviso to this sub-rule that a reference is made to the  
cross-examination of witnesses.  
22. At the outset we find that Rule 12 is not happily worded. The reason  
for establishing Banking Tribunals being to expedite the disposal of the  
claims by the banks Parliament thought it proper only to require the  
principles of natural justice to be the guiding factor for the Tribunals in  
decidin  the applications. as is evident from Section 22 of the Act. While 
the Tribunal has, no doubt, been given the power of summoning and 
enforcing the attendance of any witness and examining him on oath, but 
the Act does not contain any provision which makes it mandatory for the 
witness to be examined, if such a witness could be produced Rule 12(6)  
has to be read harmoniously with the other provisions of the Act and the  
Rules. As we have already noticed Rule 12(71 gives the Tribunal the  
power to act upon the affidavit of the applicant where the defendant denies  
his liability to pay the claims. Rule 12(6), if paraphrased, would read as 
follows: 
1. 
the Tribunal may, at any time for sufficient reason, order that 
any particular fact or facts may be proved by affidavit ... on such 
conditions as the Tribunal thinks reasonable; 
2. 
the Tribunal may, at any time for sufficient reason, order ... 
that the affidavit of any witness may be read at the hearing, on such 
conditions as the Tribunal thinks reasonable. 
23. 	
In other words, the Tribunal has the power to require any particular 
fact to be proved by affidavit, or it may order that the affidavit of any 
witness may be read at the hearing. While passing such an order, it must 
record sufficient reasons for the same. The proviso to Rule 12(6) would  
certainly apply only where the Tribunal chooses to issue a direction on its  
own for any particular fact to be proved by affidavit or the affidavit of a  
witness beirg read at the hearing. The said proviso refers to the desire of  
an applicant or a defendant for the production of a witness for cross-
examination. In the setting in which the said proviso occurs it would  
appear to us that once the parties have filed affidavits in support of their  
respective cases it is only thereafter that the desire for a witness to be  
cross-examined can legitimately arise It is at that time if it appears to the  
Tribunal that such a witness can be produced and it is necessary to do so  
and there is no desire to prolong the case that it shall require the witness  
to be present for cross-examination and in the event of his not appearing.  
then the affidavit shall not be taken into evidence When the High Courts  
and the Supreme Court in exercise of their jurisdiction under Article 226  
110 
cave 17 o 
an - 
and Article 32 can decide questions of fact as well as law merely on the  
basis of documents and affidavits filed before them ordinarily there should  
be no reason as to why a Tribunal likewise should not be able to decide  
the case merely on the basis of documents and affidavits before it. It is  
common knowledge that hardly any transaction with the bank would be  
oral and without proper documentation whether in the form of letters or  
formal agreements. In such an event the bona fide need for the oral  
examination of a witness should rarely arise There has to be a very good 
reason to hold that affidavits, in such a case, would not be sufficient. 
24. 
The manner in which a dispute is to be adjudicated upon is decided 
by the procedural laws which are enacted from time to time. It is because  
of the enactment of the Code of Civil Procedure that normally all disputes  
between the parties of a civil nature would be adiudicated upon by the civil  
courts. There is no absolute right in anyone to demand that his dispute is  
to be adjudicated upon only by a civil court. The decision of the Delhi High  
Court proceeds on the assumption that there is such a right. As we have  
already observed it is by reason of the provisions of the Code of Civil  
Procedure that the civil courts had the right, prior to the enactment of the  
Debts Recovery Act to decide the suits for recovery filed by the banks and  
financial institutions. This forum namely that of a civil court now stands  
replaced by a Banking Tribunal in respect of the debts due to the bank.  
When in the Constitution Articles 323-A and 323-B contemplate  
-stablishment of a Tribunal and that does not erode the independence of  
the judiciary there is no reason to presume that the Banking Tribunals and  
the Appellate Tribunals so constituted would not be independent or that  
justice would be denied to the defendants or that the independence of the  
judiciary would stand eroded. 
25. 
Such Tribunals whether they pertain to income tax or sales tax or  
excise or customs or administration have now become an essential part of  
the judicial system in this country. Such specialised institutions may not 
strictly come within the concept of the judiciary. as envisaged by Article 50  
but it cannot be presumed that such Tribunals are not an effective part of 
the justice delivery system like courts of law It will be seen that for a 
person to be appointed as a Presiding Officer of a Tribunal, he should be 
one who is guaffied to be a District Judge and, in case of appointment of 
the Presiding Officer of the Appellate Tribunal he is, or has been, qualified 
to be a Judge of a High Court or has been a member of the Indian Legal 
Service who has held a post in Grade I for at least three years or has held 
office as the Presiding Officer of a Tribunal for at least three years. 
Persons who are so appointed as Presiding Officers of the Tribunal or of  
the Ap ellate Tribunal would be well versed in law to be able to decide  
cases 'ndependently and judiciously_ It has to be borne in mind that the  
decision of the Appellate Tribunal is not final in the sense that the same  
can be subjected to judicial review by the High Court under Articles 226  
and 227 of the Constitution. 
111 
Page 111 
26. 
With the establishment of the Tribunals Section 31 provides for the  
transfer of eendin. ca es from civi courts to the Tribunal. We do not find 
such a provision being in any way bad in law. Once a Debts Recovery 
Tribunal has been established, and the jurisdiction of courts barred by 
Section 18 of the Act, it would be only logical that any matter pending in 
the civil court should stand transferred to the Tribunal. This is what  
happened when the Central Administrative Tribunal was established. All  
cases pending in the High Courts stood transferred. Now that exclusive  
jurisdiction is vested in the Banking Tribunal it is only in that forum that  
bank cases can be tried and therefore a provision like Section 31 was  
enacted. 
27. 
with regard to the observations of the Delhi High Court in relation to  
the pecuniary iurisdiction of the Tribunals and of the Delhi High Court the  
Act has been enacted for the whole of India. In most of the States the  
High Courts do not have original iurisdiction. In order to see that the  
Tribunal is not flooded with cases where the amounts involved are not very  
large the AM provides that it is only where the recovery of the money is  
more than Rs 10 lakhs that the Tribunal will have the iurisdiclion to  
entertain the application under Section 19. With respect to suits for  
recovery of money less than Rs 10 lakhs it is the subordinate courts which  
would continue to try them. In other words, for a claim of Rs 10 lakhs or 
more, exclusive jurisdiction has been conferred on the Tribunal but for any 
amount less than Rs 10 lakhs, it is the ordinary civil courts which will have 
jurisdiction. The bifurcation of original lurisdiction between the Delhi High  
Court and the subordinate courts is a matter which cannot have any  
bearing on the validity of the establishment of the Tribunal. It is only in  
those High Courts which have original jurisdiction that an anomalous  
situation arises where suits for recovery of money less than Rs 10 lakhs  
have to be decided by the High Courts while the Tribunals have iurisdiction  
to decide suits for recovery of more than Rs 10 lakhs. This incongruous  
situation. which can be remedied by the High Court divesting itself of the  
original iurisdiction in regard to such claims and vesting the said  
jurisdiction with the subordinate courts or vice versa cannot be a ground  
for holding that the Act is invalid.

30. By virtue of Section 29 of the Act, the provisions of the Second and 
Third Schedules to the Income Tax Act, 1961 and the Income Tax 
(Certificate Proceedings) Rules, 1962, have become applicable for the 
realisation of the dues by the Recovery Officer. Detailed 	
dure for 
recovery is contained in these Schedules to the Income Tax Act including  
provisions relating to arrest and detention of the defaulter. It cannot  
therefore be said that the Recovery Officer would act in an arbitrary  
manner. Furthermore. Section 30. after amendment by the Amendment  
Act 2000 gives a right to any person aggrieved by an order of the  
Recovery Officer to prefer an appeal to the Tribunal. Thus now an 
112 
Page 112 
appellate forum has been provided against any orders of the Recovery 
Officer which may not be in accordance with law. There is therefore.  
sufficient safeguard which has been provided in the event of the Recovery  
Officer acting in an arbitrary or an unreasonable manner. The provisions of  
Sections 25 and 28 are therefore not bad in law.  
31. 	
For the aforesaid reasons. while allowing the appeals of the Union of 
India and the Banks we hold that the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and  
Financial Institutions Act 1993 is a valid piece of legislation. As a result  
thereof the writ petitions or appeals filed by various parties challenging the  
validity of the said Act or some of the provisions thereof are dismissed. It  
would be open to the parties to raise other contentions on the merits of  
their cases before the authority constituted under the Act and only  
thereafter should a High Court entertain a petition under Articles 226  
and/or 227 of the Constitution. Transferred cases stand disposed of  
accordingly. Parties to bear their own costs." 
(iii) 	
Reliance was next placed on State of Karnataka v. Vishwabharathi House 
Building Cooperative Society & Ors., (2003) 2 SCC 412. The primary question 
which arose for consideration was the constitutional validity of the Consumer 
Protection Act, 1986. The challenge was raised on the ground, that Parliament 
was not empowered to establish a hierarchy of courts like the District Fora, the 
State Commission and the National Commission, as this would constitute a 
parallel hierarchy of courts, in addition to the courts established under the 
Constitution, namely, District Courts, High Courts and the Supreme Court. In this 
behalf the pointed submission was, that Parliament could only establish courts. 
with power to deal with specific subjects, but not such a court which would run 
parallel to the civil courts. It was sought to be asserted, that even under Articles 
323A and 323B of the Constitution, Parliament could not enact a legislation, by 
which it could establish tribunals, in substitution of civil courts including the High 
Court. This, according to those who raised the challenge, would strike at the 
independence of the judiciary. As against the above assertions, the legislative 
113 
Page 113 
competence of the Parliament and the State Legislatures, to provide for creation 
of courts and tribunals, reliance was placed on entries 77, 78 and 79 in List I of 
the Seventh Schedule, as also, entries 11A and 46 contained in List III of the 
Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. While examining the challenge raised to 
the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, on the grounds referred to above, this Court 
held as under:- 
"12. A bare perusal of the aforementioned provisions does not leave any  
manner of doubt as regard the legislative competence of Parliament to  
provide for creation of Special Courts and Tribunals. Administration of 
justice; constitution and organization of all courts, except the Supreme 
Court and the High Courts is squarely covered by Entry 11-A of List III of 
the Constitution of India. The said entry was originally a part of Entry 3 of 
List II. By reason of the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 
and by Section 57(a)(vi) thereof, it was inserted into List III as Item 11-A. 
13. 
By virtue of clause (2) of Article 246 of the Constitution Parliament  
has the requisite power to make laws with respect of constitution of  
c Ag
-  anization of all courts except the Supreme Court and the High Court. 
14. 
The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners could not  
seriously dispute the plenary power of Parliament to make a law as regard  
constitution of courts but as noticed supra merely urged that it did not  
have the competence to create parallel civil courts. 
15. 
The said submission has been made purported to be relying on or 
on the basis of the following observations made by Shinghal, J. while 
delivering a partially dissenting judgment in Special Courts Bill, 1978, In re: 
(1979) 1 SCC 380 (SCC at p. 455, para 152) 
t152. 	
The Constitution has thus made ample and effective provision  
for the establishment of a strong. independent and impartial iudicial  
administration in the country with the necessary complement of civil  
and criminal courts. It is not permissible for Parliament or a State  
Legislature to ignore or bypass that scheme of the Constitution by  
providing for the establishment of a civil or criminal court parallel to a  
High Court in a State or by way of an additional or extra or a second  
High Court. or a court other than a court subordinate to the High Court.  
Any such attempt would be unconstitutional and will strike at the  
independence of the ludiciary which has so nobly been enshrined in the  
Constitution and so carefully nursed over the years." 
16. 
The argument of the learned counsel is fallacious inasmuch as the  
provisions of the said Act are in addition to the provisions of any other law  
114 
Page 119 
far the time being in force and not in derogation thereof as is evident from  
Section 3 thereof. 
17. 
The provisions of the said Act clearly demonstrate that it was  
enacted keeping in view the long-felt necessity of protecting the common  
man from wrongs wherefor the ordinary law for all intent and purport had  
become illusory In terms of the said Act a consumer is entitled to  
participate in the proceedings directly as a result whereof his helplessness  
against a powerful business house may be taken care of. 
18. 
This Court in a large number of decisions considered the purport 
and object of the said Act. By reason of the said statute, quasi-judicial 
authorities have been created at the district, State and Central levels so as 
to enable a consumer to ventilate his grievances before a forum where 
justice can be done without any procedural wrangles and 
hypertechnicalities. 
19. 
One of the objects of the said Act is to provide momentum to the 
consumer movement. The Central Consumer Protection Council is also to 
be constituted in terms of Section 4 of the Act to promote and protect the 
rights of the consumers as noticed hereinbefore.

24. 
in terms of Section 10, the President of a District Forum shall be a 
person who is, or has been, or is qualified to be a District Judge and the 
Forum shall also consist of two other members who are required to be 
persons of ability, integrity and standing and have adequate knowledge or 
experience of, or have shown capacity in dealing with, problems relating to 
economics, law, commerce, accountancy, industry, public affairs or 
administration and one of them shall be a woman. The tenure of the 
members of the District Forum is fixed. 
25. 
Section 13 of the said Act lays down a detailed procedure as 
regards the mode and manner in which the complaints received by the 
District Forum are required to be dealt with. Section 14 provides for the 
directions which can be issued by the District Forum on arriving at a 
satisfaction that the goods complained against suffer from any of the 
defects specified in the complaint .or that any of the allegations contained 
in the complaint about the deficiencies in services have been proved. 
26. 
Section 15 provides for an appeal from the order made by the 
District Forum to the State Commission. 
27. 
Section 16 provides for composition of the State Commission which 
reads thus' 
"16. (1) Each State Commission shall consist of,— 
(a) a person who is or has been a Judge of a High Court, 
appointed by the State Government, who shall be its President: 
Provided that no appointment under this clause shall be made 
except after consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court; 
(b) two other members, who shall be persons of ability, integrity 
and standing and have adequate knowledge or experience of, or 
115 
Page 115 
-c-ib 
 
have shown capacity in dealing with, problems relating to 
economics, law, commerce, accountancy, industry, public affairs 
or administration, one of whom shall be a woman: 
Provided that every appointment under this clause shall be made 
by the State Government on the recommendation of a Selection 
Committee consisting of the following, namely: 
8) 	
President of the State Commission: 	
Chairman 
(ii) 
Secretary of the Law Department of the State: Member 
(iii) 
Secretary in charge of the Department dealing with 
consumer affairs in the State: 	
Member 
(2) 
The salary or honorarium and other allowances payable to, 
and the other terms and conditions of service of the members of the 
State Commission shall be such as may be prescribed by the State 
Government. 
(3) 
Every member of the State Commission shall hold office for a 
term of five years or up to the age of sixty-seven years, whichever is 
earlier and shall not be eligible for reappointment. 
(4) 
Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (3), a 
person appointed as a President or as a member before the 
commencement of the Consumer Protection (Amendment) Act, 
1993, shall continue to hold such office as President or member, as 
the case may be, till the completion of his term." 
The members of the State Commission are to be selected by a 
Selection Committee, the Chairman whereof would be the President 
of the State Commission. 
28. 
Section 19 provides for an appeal from a decision of the State 
Commission to the National Commission. Section 20 deals with the 
composition of the National Commission, the President whereof would be 
a person who is or has been a Judge of the Supreme Court and such 
appointment shall be made only upon consultation with the Chief Justice of 
India. So far as the members of the National Commission are concerned, 
the same are also to be made on the recommendation of the Selection 
Committee, the Chairman whereof would be a person who is a Judge of 
the Supreme Court to be nominated by the Chief Justice of India. The 
tenure of the office of the National Commission is also fixed by reason of 
sub-section (3) of Section 20. 
29. 
By reason of the provisions of the said Act therefore independent  
authorities have been created. 
30. 
Sections 15, 19 and 23 provide for the hierarchy of appeals. By 
reason of sub-sections (4), (5) and (6) of Section 13, the Dist ct Forum 
shall have the same powers as are vested in the civil courts for the 
purposes mentioned therein. Sub-sections (2) and (2-A) of Section 14 
mandate that the proceedings shall be conducted by the President of the 
District Forum and at least one member thereof sitting together. Only in the 
event of any difference between them on any point or points, the same is 
116 
Page 1 I g 
I
to be referred to the other member for hearing thereon and the opinion of 
the majority shall be the order of the District Forum. By reason of Section 
18, the provisions of Sections 12, 13 and 14 and the rules made 
thereunder would mutatis mutandis be applicable to the disposal of 
disputes by the State Commission. 
31. Section 23 provides for a limited appeal to the Supreme Court from 
an order made by the National Commission i.e. when the same is made in 
exercise of its original power as conferred by sub-clause (0 of clause (a) of 
Section 211" 
This Court then, having placed reliance on Union of India v. Delhi High Court Bar 
Association (supra), Navinchandra Mafatlal, Bombay v. The Commissioner of 
Income Tax, Bombay City, AIR 1955 SC 58, and Union of India v. Harbhajan 
Singh Dhillon, (1971) 2 SCC 779, concluded as under:- 
"37. Once it is held that Parliament had the legislative competence to  
enact the said Act the submissions of the learned counsel that the  
relevant provisions of the Constitution required amendments must be  
neglected 
38. 
The scope and object of the said legislation came up for 
consideration before this Court in Common Cause, A Registered Society v. 
Union of India, (1997) 10 SCC 729. It was held: (SCC p. 730, pare 2) 
"2. 	
The object of the legislation, as the preamble of the Act 
proclaims, is 'for better protection of the interests of consumers'. 
During the last few years preceding the enactment there was in this 
country a marked awareness among the consumers of goods that 
they were not getting their money's worth and were being exploited 
by both traders and manufacturers of consumer goods. The need for 
consumer redressal fora was, therefore, increasingly felt. 
Understandably, therefore, legislation was introduced and enacted 
with considerable enthusiasm and fanfare as a path-breaking 
benevolent legislation intended to protect the consumer from 
exploitation by unscrupulous manufacturers and traders of consumer 
goods. A three-tier fora comprising the District Forum, the State 
Commission and the National Commission came to be envisaged 
under the Act for redressal of grievances of consumers." 
39. 
The rights of the parties have adequately been safeguarded by  
reason of the provisions of the said Act inasmuch as although it provides  
for an alternative system of consumer iurisdiction on summary trial they  
are required o arrive at a conclusion based on reasons. Even when  
quantifying damages they are required to make an attempt to serve the 
ends of iustice aiming not only at recompensing the individual but also to  
117 
Page 117 
brio about a qualitative change in the attitude of the service provider.  
Assignment of reasons excludes or at any rate minimizes the chances of  
arbitrariness and the higher forums created under the Act can test the  
correctness thereof. 
40. The District Forum the State Commission and the National  
Commission are not manned by lay persons. The President would be a  
person having iudicial background and other members are required to  
have the expertise in the subiects such as economics law commerce  
accountancy industry public affairs administration etc. It may be true that  
by reason of sub-section (2-A1 of Section 14 of he Act in a case of  
difference of opinion between two members the matter has to be referred  
to a third member and in rare cases the majority opinion of the members  
may prevail over the President. But such eventuality alone is insufficient  
for striking down the Act as unconstitutional. particularly. when provisions  
have been made therein for appeal thereagainst to a higher forum. 
41 	
By reason of the provisions of the said Act the power of iudicial  
review of the High Court which is a basic feature of the Constitution. has  
not been nor could be taken away. 
xxx 	
xxx 	
xxx 
49. 	
The question as rPnards the applicability or otherwise of Articles  
323-A and 323-B of the Constitution in the matter of constitution of such  
Tribunals came up for consideration before this Court in L. Chandra Kumar 
v. Union of India (1997) 3 SCC 261 This Court therein clearly held that  
the constitutional provisions vest Parliament and the State Legislatures as  
the case may be with powers to divest the traditional courts of a  
considerable portion of their judicial work. It was observed that the  
Parliament and the State Legislatures possess legislative competence to  
effect changes in the original iurisdiction of the Supreme Court and High  
Court apart from the authorisation that flows from Articles 323-A and 323-8  
in terms of Entries 77 78 79 and 95 of List I so far as the Parliament is  
concerned and in terms of Entry 65 of List II and Entry 46 of List III so far  
as the State Legislatures are concerned. It was further held that power of  
judicial review being the basic structure of the Constitution cannot be taken  
away. 
50. We therefore. are clearly of the opinion that the said Act cannot be  
said to be unconstitutional." 
The fourth contention: 
52(i) In response to the fourth contention, namely, the challenge raised by the 
learned counsel for the petitioners, to the various provisions of the NTT Act, it 
was the submission of the learned counsel for the respondents, that in view of 
II 8 
Page 11B 
the submissions advanced in respect of the third contention, it is apparent that 
the Parliament had the legislative competence to enact the NTT Act. It was 
submitted, that the NTT Act was enacted keeping in mind the parameters laid 
down by this Court, by preserving the power of judicial review vested in the High 
Courts under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, as also, by preserving the 
power of judicial review vested in this Court under Articles 32 and 136 of the 
Constitution. It is, therefore, submitted that the final word in respect of the instant 
adjudicatory process, stands preserved with courts of law. And therefore, the 
submissions advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the petitioners on 
the individual provisions of the NTT Act, pertaining to the independence of the 
adjudicatory process, were being exaggerated out of proportion. 
(ii) 	
Despite having made the above submissions, the Attorney General for 
India, was fair and candid in stating, that if this Court felt that there was need to 
make certain changes in the provisions referred to by the petitioners, he had the 
instructions to state, that any suggestion made by this Court will be viewed 
positively, and necessary amendments in the NTT Act would be carried out. 
The debate and the consideration: 
I. 	
Constitutional validity of the NTT Act — Does the NTT Act violate the "basic 
structure" of the Constitution?  
53. 	
The principal contention advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for 
the petitioners was premised on the submission, that Article 323B, inserted by 
the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act 1976, to the extent that it 
violated the principles of, "separation of powers", "rule of law", and "judicial 
119 
Page 119 
o 
review", was liable to be struck down. This striking down was founded on an 
alleged violation of the "basic structure" doctrine. Similarly, various provisions of 
the NTT Act, were sought to be assailed. The provisions of the NTT Act were 
challenged, on the premise, that they had trappings of executive control, over the 
adjudicatory process vested with the NTT, and therefore, were liable to be set 
aside as unconstitutional. 
54. In the context of the foregoing submissions advanced at the hands of the 
learned counsel for the petitioners, it is essential for us to examine the exact 
contours of "judicial review", in the framework and scheme, of the concepts of 
"rule of law" and "separation of powers", which have been held to constitute the 
"basic structure of the Constitution. And also, the essential ingredients, of an 
independent adjudicatory process. It is, therefore, that we would travel the 
ladder of history and law. to determine the exact scope of the "judicial review", 
which constitutes the "basic structure" of the Constitution. This would lead us to 
unravel the salient ingredients of an independent adjudicatory process. Based 
thereon, we will record our conclusions. The analysis: 
55. 	
Reference must first of all be made to the decision rendered by this Court 
in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, (1973) 4 SCC 225. In the above 
cited case, this Court was engaged with the validity of the Constitution (Twenty-
fourth Amendment) Act, 1971, as also, the Constitution (Twenty-fifth 
Amendment) Act, 1971. The former Act related to the amendments of Articles 13 
and 368 of the Constitution, whereas the latter, pertained to the amendment of 
Article 31 of the Constitution. The instant judgment was rendered by a 
120 
Page 120 
constitution bench of 13 Judges. Seven of the Judges expressed the majority 
view. The observations recorded by this Court recognising "judicial review" as a 
component of the "basic structure" of the Constitution, were made by four 
Judges. Reference is first of all being made, to the view expressed by S.M. Sikri, 
"292. 	
The learned Attorney-General said that every provision of the 
Constitution is essential; otherwise it would not have been put in the 
Constitution. This is true. But this does not place every provision of the 
Constitution in the same position. The true pos'fion is that every provision of 
the Constitution can be amended provided in the result the basic foundation  
and structure of the constitution remains the same. The basic structure may 
be said to consist of the following features:  
(1) Supremacy of the Constitution; 
(2) Republican and Democratic form of Government; 
(3) Secular character of the Constitution; 
(4) Separation of powers between the legislature the executive and the  
judiciary' 
(5) Federal character of the Constitution. 
293. The above structure is built on the basic foundation i.a the dignity  
and freedom of the individual. This is of supreme importance. This cannot by  
any form of amendment be destroyed." 
It is also imperative to refer to the view expressed by J.M. Shelat and A.N. 
Grover, JJ., who delivered a common judgment: 
"487 	
The Rule of Law has been ensured by providing for iudicial review  " 
xxx 	
xxx 	
xxx 
577_ 	
Judicial review is undertaken by the courts "not out of any desire to 
tilt at legislative authority in a crusader's spirit, but in discharge of a duty 
plainly laid down upon them by the Constitution". The respondents have also 
contended that to let the court have judicial review over constitutional 
amendments would mean involving the court in political questions. To this the 
answer may be given in the words of Lord Porter in Commonwealth of 
Australia v. Bank of New South Wales, 1950 AC 235 at 310,: 
"The problem to be solved will often be not so much legal as political, 
social or economic, yet it must be solved by a Court of law. For where 
the dispute is, as here, not only between Commonwealth and citizen 
but between Commonwealth and intervening States on the one hand 
121 
Page 121 
yqq 	
— 
and citizens and States on the other, it is only the Court that can decide 
the issue, it is vain to invoke the voice of Parliament." 
There is ample evidence in the Constitution itself to indicate that it creates a  
system of checks and balances by reason of which powers are so distributed  
that none of the three organs it sets up can become so pre-dominant as to  
disable the others from exercising and discharging powers and functions  
entrusted to them. Though the Constitution does not lay down the principle of 
separation of powers in all its rigidity as is the case in the United States 
Constitution but it envisages such a separation to a degree as was found in 
Ranasinghe's case, 1965 AC 172. The iudicial review provided expressly in  
our Constitution by means of Articles 226 and 32 is one of the features upon  
which hinges the system of checks and balances. Apart from that, as already 
stated, the necessity for judicial decision on the competence or otherwise of 
an Act arises from the very federal nature of a Constitution (per Haldane, L.C. 
in Attorney-General for the Commonwealth of Australia v. Colonial Sugar 
Refining Co., 1914 AC 237 and Ex parte Walsh & Johnson; In re Yates. 
(1925) 37 CLR 36 at page 58. The function of interpretation of a Constitution  
being thus assigned to the iudicial power of the State the question whether  
the subject of a law is within the ambit of one or more powers of the  
Legislature conferred by the Constitution would always be a question of  
interpretation of the Constitution. It may be added that at no stage the 
respondents have contested the proposition that the validity of a constitutional 
amendment can be the subject of review by this Court. The Advocate-General 
of Maharashtra has characterized judicial review as undemocratic. That 
cannot, however, be so in our Constitution because of the provisions relating 
to the appointment of Judges, the specific restriction to which the fundamental 
rights are made subject, the deliberate exclusion of the due process clause in 
Article 21 and the affirmation in Article 141 that Judges declare but not make 
law. To this may be added the none too rigid amendatory process which 
authorizes amendment by means of 2/3 majority and the additional 
requirement of ratification.

582. 	
The basic structure of the Constitution is not a vague concept and 
the apprehensions expressed on behalf of the respondents that neither the 
citizen nor the Parliament would be able to understand it are unfounded. If the 
 
historical background the preamble the entire scheme of the Constitution  
relevant provisions thereof including Article 368 are kept in mind there can be  
no  difficulty in discerning that the following can be regarded as the basic  
elements of the constitutional structure. (These cannot be catalogued but can 
only be illustrated): 
(1) The supremacy of the Constitution. 
(2) Republican and Democratic form of government and sovereignty of 
the country. 
(3) Secular and federal character of the Constitution_ 
122

executive and 
freedoms and 
welfare State 
(4) Demarcation of power between the Legislature the  
the judiciary. 
(5) The dignity of the individual secured by the various 
basic rights in Part III and the mandate to build a 
contained in Part IV. 
(6) The unity and the integrity of the Nation." 
In this behalf it is also imperative for us to record the observations of P. 
Jaganmohan Reddy, J., who observed as under.- 
"1104. _There is no constitutional matter which is not in some way or the 
other involved with political, social or economic questions, and if the 
Constitution-makers have vested in this Court a power of Judicial review, and 
while so vesting, have given it a prominent place describing it as the heart and 
soul of the Constitution, we will not be deterred from discharging that duty, 
merely because the validity or otherwise of the legislation will affect the 
political or social policy underlying it. The basic approach of this Court has  
been and must always be. that the Legislature has the exclusive power to  
determine the policy and to translate it into law the constitutionality of which is  
to be presumed unless there are strong and cogent reasons for holding that it 
conflicts with the constitutional mandate. In this regard both the Legislature  
the executive as well as the ludiciary are bound by the  •aramount instrument.  
and therefore no court and no Judge will exercise the iudicial power dehors  
that instrument nor will it function as a supreme legislature above the  
Constitution. The bona tides of all the three of them has been the basic  
assumption and though all of them may be liable to error it can be corrected  
in the manner and by the method prescribed under the Constitution and  
subject to such limitations as may be inherent in the instrument: 
Some of the observations of H.R. Khanna, J., are also relevant to the issue in 
hand. The same are placed hereunder: 
"1529. 	
..... The power of judicial review is. however, confined not merely to 
deciding whether in making the impugned laws the Central or State 
Legislatures have acted within the four corners of the legislative lists 
earmarked for them; the courts also deal with the question as to whether the 
laws are made in conformity with and not in violation of the other provisions of 
the Constitution. Our Constitution-makers have provided for fundamental  
rights in Part III and made them iusficiable. As long as some fundamental  
rights exist and are a part of the Constitution the power of ludicial review has  
also to be exercised with a view to see that the guarantees afforded by those  
rights are not contravened. Dealing with draft Article 25 (corresponding to  
present Article 32 of the Constitution) by which a right is given to move the  
123 
Page 133 
- 
Supreme Court for enforcement of the fundamental rights Dr Ambedkar  
speaking in the Constituent Assembly on December 9 1948 observed:  
"If I was asked to name any particular article in this Constitution as the  
most important an article without which this Constitution would be a  
nullity — I could not refer to any other article except this one It is the  
very soul of the Constitution and the very heart of it and I am glad that 
the House has realised its importance" (Constituent Assembly Debates, 
Vol VII, p. 953). 
Judicial review has thus become an integral part of our constitutional system  
and a power has been vested in the High Courts and the Supreme Court to  
decide about the constitutional validity of provisions of statutes. 
Our Constitution postulates rule of law in the sense of supremacy of the  
Constitution and the laws as opposed to arbitrariness. The vesting of power of  
exclusion of iudicial review in a legislature including State Legislature.  
contemplated by Article 31-C in my opinion strikes at the basic structure of  
the Constitution. The second part of Article 31-C thus goes beyond the  
permissible limit of what constitutes amendment under Article 368.  
xxx 	
xxx 
1533. 	
The position as it emerges is that it is open to the authority 
amending the Constitution to exclude judicial review regarding the validity of 
an existing statute. It is likewise open to the said authority to exclude judicial 
review regarding the validity of a statute which might be enacted by the 
legislature in future in respect of a specified subject. In such an event, judicial 
review is not excluded for finding whether the statute has been enacted in 
respect of the specified subject. Both the above types of constitutional 
amendments are permissible under Article 368. What is not permissible  
however is a third type of constitutional amendment according to which the  
amending authority not merely excludes iudicial review regarding the validity  
of a statute which might be enacted by the legislature in future in respect of a  
gpecified subject but also excludes judicial review for finding whether the  
statute enacted by the legislature is in respect of the subiect for which iudicial  
review has been excluded. 
xxx 	
xxx 	
xxx 
1537. 	
I may now sum up my conclusions relating to power of amendment 
under Article 368 of the Constitution as it existed before the amendment made 
by the Constitution (Twenty-fourth Amendment) Act as well as about the 
validity of the Constitution (Twenty-fourth Amendment) Act, the Constitution 
(Twenty-fifth Amendment) Act and the Constitution (Twenty-ninth 
Amendment) Act: 
(i) Article 368 contains not only the procedure for the amendment of the 
Constitution but also confers the power of amending the Constitution. 
(ii) Entry 97 in List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution does not 
cover the subject of amendment of the Constitution. 
(iii) The word "laW' in Article 13(2) does not include amendment of the 
Constitution. It has reference to ordinary piece of legislation. It would also 
124 
Page 129 
in view of the definition contained in clause (a) of Article 13(3) include an 
ordinance, order, bye-law, rule, regulation, notification, custom or usage 
having in the territory of India the force of law. 
xxx 	
xxx 	
xxx 
(vii) The power of amendment under Article 368 does not include the  
power to abrogate the Constitution nor does it include the power to alter  
the basic structure or framework of the Constitution. Subiect to the  
retention of the basic structure or framework of the Constitution the power  
of amendment is plenary and includes within itself the power to amend the  
various articles of the Constitution including those relating to fundamental  
rights as well as those which may be said to relate to essential features. 
No part of a fundamental right can claim immunity from amendatory  
process by beina described as the essence or core of that right. The 
power of amendment would also include within itself the power to add, 
alter or repeal the various articles. 
xxx 	
xxx 	
Go( 
(xiv) The second part of Article 31-C contains the seed of national 
disintegration and is invalid on the following two grounds: 
.(1) 	
It gives a carte blanche to the legislature to make any law 
violative of Articles 14, 19 and 31 and make it immune from attack by 
inserting the requisite declaration. Article 31-C taken along with its 
second part gives in effect the power to the legislature including a State 
Legislature, to amend the Constitution in important respects. 
(2) 	
The legislature has been made the final authority to decide as to  
whether the law made by it is for the objects mentioned in Article 31-C.  
The vice of second part of Article 31-C lies in the fact that even if the  
law enacted is not for the object mentioned in Article 31-C the  
declaration made by the legislature precludes a party from showing that  
the law is not for that obiect and prevents a court from going into the  
question as to whether the law enacted is really for that object. The  
exclusion by the legislature including a State Legislature of even that  
limited judicial review strikes at the basic structure of the Constitution.  
The second part of Article 31-C goes beyond the permissible limit of  
what constitutes amendment under Article 368.  
The second part of Article 31-C can be severed from the  
remaining part of Article 31-C and its invalidity would not affect the  
validity of the remaining part. I would therefore t 'k down the  
following words in Article 31-C -- 
"and no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect 
policy shall be called in question in any court on the ground that it  
does not give effect to such policy"." 
56(i) The next judgment having a bearing on the subject is Smt. Indira Nehru 
Gandhi v. Shri Raj Narain, 1975 Supp. SCC 1. In the instant judgment, this 
125 
Page 125 
Court examined the constitutional validity of the Constitution (Thirty-ninth 
Amendment) Act, 1975. The issue under reference included the insertion of 
Article 329A (and more particularly, the second clause thereof), which had the 
effect of taking out from the purview of judicial review", the validity of the election 
of a person who was holding, either the office of the Prime Minister or of the 
Speaker, or had come to be appointed/chosen as the Prime Minister or the 
Speaker, after such election. Insofar as the instant aspect of the matter is 
concerned, it would be relevant to mention, that the election of the appellant from 
the Rae Bareli constituency in the General Parliamentary Elections of 1971, was 
set aside by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad (hereinafter referred to as, 
the High Court), on 12.6.1975. The appellant had assailed the order passed by 
the High Court before this Court. During the pendency of the above appeal, on 
10.8.1975, the Constitution (Thirty-ninth Amendment) Act was passed, which 
introduced two new Articles, namely, Articles 71 and 329A of the Constitution. 
The controversy arising out of the above referred appeal, therefore, virtually 
came to be rendered infructuous. It was, by way of a cross-appeal, that the 
constitutional validity of the amended provisions was assailed. 
(ii) 	
In the above cross-appeal, it was asserted at the hands of the respondent, 
that /judicial review" was an essential feature of the "basic structure" of the 
Constitution. This assertion was under the doctrine of "separation of powers". 
The pointed submission at the hands of the learned counsel for the respondent 
was, that "judicial review", in matters of election was imperative. The issue 
canvassed was, that judicial review" would ensure free, fair and pure elections. 
126 
Page 126 
It was sought to be asserted, that the power of "judicial review" in the context 
referred to hereinabove, was available both under the American Constitution, as 
also, the Australian Constitution. And therefore, even though there was no 
express/clear provision on the subject under the Indian Constitution, since the 
executive, the legislature and the judiciary were earmarked respective spheres of 
activity (by compartmentalising them into separate parts and chapters), the charge 
and onus of "judicial review" fell within the sphere of activity of the judiciary. It 
was sought to be asserted, that under Article 136 of the Constitution, all tribunals 
and courts are amenable to the jurisdiction of this Court. The corollary sought to 
be drawn was, that if under clause 4 of Article 329A of the Constitution, the 
power of 'judicial review" was taken away, it would amount to a destruction of the 
"basic structure of the Constitution. The relevant observations made in the 
instant judgment rendered by a constitution bench of 5 Judges of this Court are 
being extracted hereunder_ First and foremost reference may be made to the 
following observations of A.N. Ray, CJ:- 
"16. It should be stated here that the hearing has proceeded on the 
assumption that it is not necessary to challenge the majority view in 
Kesavananda Bharati's case, (1973) 4 SCC 225. The contentions of the 
respondent are these: First, under Article 368 only general principles 
governing the organs of the State and the basic principles can be laid down. 
An amendment of the Constitution does not contemplate any decision in 
respect of individual cases. Clause (4) of Article 329-A is said to be exercise 
of a purely judicial power which is not included in the constituent power 
conferred by Article 368. 
xxx 	
xxx 	
xxx 
20. 	
Fifth clause (41 destroys not only iudicial review but also separation of  
power. The order of the High Court declaring the election to be void is  
declared valid (lie void). The cancellation of the iud ment is denial of political  
justice which is the basic structure of the Constitution.  
xxx 	
xxx 	
X)0( 
127 
Page 127 
52. 	
Judicial review in election disputes is not a compulsion. Judicial review 
of decisions in election disputes may be entrusted by law to a judicial tribunal. 
If it is to a tribunal or to the High Court the judicial review will be attracted 
either under the relevant law providing for appeal to this Court or Article 136 
may be attracted. Under Article 329(b) the contemplated law may vest the 
power to entertain election petitions in the House itself which may determine 
the dispute by a resolution after receiving a report from a special committee. 
In such cases judicial review may be eliminated without involving amendment 
of the Constitution..... If judicial review is excluded the court is not in a 
position to conclude that principles of equality have been violated. 
xxx 	
xxx 	
xxx 
153. The contentions of the respondent that the Amendment Acts of 1974 
and 1975 are subject to basic features or basic structure or basic framework 
fails on two grounds. First, legislative measures are not subject to the theory 
of basic features or basic structure or basic framework. Second, the majority 
view in Kesavananda Bharates case (supra) is that the Twenty-ninth 
Amendment which put the two statutes in the Ninth Schedule and Article 31-B 
is not open to challenge on the ground of either damage to or destruction of 
basic features;  basic structure or basic framework or on the ground of 
violation of fundamental rights." 
The views expressed by H.R. Khanna, J. are now being reproduced below:- 
"175. The proposition that the rower of amendment under Article 368 does  
not enable Parliament to alter the basic structure of framework of the  
Constitution was laid down by this Court by a majority of 7 to 6 in the case of  
His Holiness Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala. (1973) 4 SCC 225.  
Apart from other reasons which were given in some of the ludgments of the  
learned Judges who constituted the maiority the maiority dealt with the  
connotation of the word "amendment". It was held that the words "amendment  
of the Constitution" in Article 368 could not have the effect of destroying or  
abrogating the basic structure of the Constitution. Some of us who were 
parties to that case took a different view and came to the conclusion that the 
words "amendment of the Constitution" in Article 368 did not admit of any 
limitation. Those of us who were in the minority in Kesavananda Bharatiff 
case (supra) may still hold the same view as was given expression to in that 
case. For the purpose of the present case we shall have to proceed in  
accordance with the law as laid down by the majority in that case.  
176. 	
Before dealing with the question as to whether the impugned 
amendment affects the basic structure of the Constitution, I may make it clear 
that this Court is not concerned with the wisdom behind or the propriety of the 
impugned constitutional amendment. These are matters essentially for those 
who are vested with the authority to make the constitutional amendment. All 
that this Court is concerned with is the constitutional validity of the impugned 
amendment. 
128

210. 	
It has been arqued in support of the constitutional validity of clause Mk 
that as a result of this amendment the validity of one election has been  
preserved. Since the basic structure of the Constitution. according to the  
submission continues to be the same clause (41 cannot be said to be an  
impermissible  piece of constitutional amendment. The argument has a 
seeming plausibility about it, but a deeper reflection would show that it is 
vitiated by a basic fallacy. Law normally connotes a rule or norm which is of  
general application It may apply to all the persons or class of persons or even  
individuals of a particular description. Law prescribes the abstract principles  
by the application of which individual cases are decided. Law however, is not 
what Blackstone called "a sentence". According to Roscoe Pound, law, as 
distinguished from laws, is the system of authoritative materials for grounding 
or guiding judicial and administrative action recognised or established in a 
politically organized society (see p. 106, Jurisprudence, Vol. III). Law is not 
the same as judgment. Law lays down the norm in abstract terms with a 
coercive power and sanction against those guilty of violating the norm, while 
judgment represents the decision arrived at by the application of law to the 
concrete facts of a case. Constitutional law relates to the various orar
g 	
a 
State' it deals with the structure of the Government the extent of distribution  
of its powers and the modes and principles of its operation. The Constitution  
of India is so detailed that some of the matters which in a brief Constitution  
like that of the United States of America are dealt with by statutes form the  
subiect-matter of various articles of our Constitution. There is, however, in a 
constitutional law, as there is in the very idea of law, some element of 
generality or general application. It also carries with it a concept of its 
applicability in future to situations which may arise in that context. If there is 
amendment of some provision of the Constitution and the amendment deals 
with matters which constitute constitutional law, in the normally accepted 
sense, the court while deciding the question of the validity of the amendment 
would have to find out, in view of the majority opinion in Kesavananda 
Bharati's case (supra), as to whether the amendment affects the basic 
structure of the Constitution. The constitutional amendment contained in 
clause (4) with which we are concerned in the present case is. however, of an 
altogether different nature. Its avowed object is to confer validity on the 
election of the appellant to the Lok Sabha in 1971 after that election had been 
declared to be void by the High Court and an appeal against the judgment of 
the High Court was pending in this Court. In spite of our query, we were not 
referred to any precedent of a similar amendment of any Constitution of the 
world. The uniqueness of the impugned constitutional amendment would not, 
however, affect its validity. If the constituent authority in its wisdom has 
chosen the validity of a disputed election as the subject-matter of a 
constitutional amendment, this Court cannot go behind that wisdom. All that 
this Court is concerned with is the validity of the amendment. I need not go 
into the question as to whether such a matter, in view of the normal concept of 
129 
Page 129 
constitutional law, can strictly be the subject of a constitutional amendment. I 
shall for the purpose of this cas assume that such a matter can validly be the 
subject-matter of a constitutional amendment. The Question to be decided is  
that if the impugned amendment of the Constitution violates a principle which  
jg_part of the basic structure of the Constitution can it eniov immunity from an  
attack on its validity because of the fact that for the future the basic structure  
of the Constitution remains unaffected. The answer to the above question. in  
my opinion. should be in the negative. What has to be seen in such a matter 
is whether the amendment contravenes or runs counter to an imperative rule 
or postulate which is an integral part of the basic structure of the Constitution. 
If so, it would be an impermissible amendment and it would make no 
difference whether it relates to one case or a large number of cases. If an  
amendment striking at the basic structure of the Constitution is not  
permissible it would not acquire validity by being related only to one case. To  
accede to the argument advanced in support of the validity of the amendment  
would be tantamount to holding that even though it is not permissible to  
change the basic structure of the Constitution whenever the authority  
concerned deems it proper to make such an amendment it can do so and  
circumvent the bar to the making of such an amendment by confining it to one  
case. What is prohibited cannot become permissible because of its being 
confined to one matter." 
On the issue in hand, K.K. Mathew, J.'s views were as under:- 
"318. The major problem of human society is to combine that degree of 
liberty without which law is tyranny with that degree of law without which 
liberty becomes licence; and, the difficulty has been to discover the practical 
means of achieving this grand objective and to find the opportunity for 
applying these means in the ever-shifting tangle of human affairs. A large part 
of the effort of man over centuries has been expended in seeking a solution of 
this great problem- A region of law, in contrast to the tyranny of power, can be 
achieved only through separating appropriately the several powers of the 
Government. If the lawmakers should also be the constant administrators and 
dispensers of law and justice. then the people would be left without a remedy 
in case of iniustice since no appeal can lie under the fiat against such a  
supremacy. And in this age-old search of political philosophers for the secret 
of sound Government, combined with individual liberty, it was Montesquieu 
who first saw the light. He was the first among the political philosophers who 
saw the necessity of separating judicial power from the executive and 
legislative branches of Government. Montesquieu was the first to conceive of 
the three functions of Government as exercised by three organs, each 
juxtaposed against others. He realised that the efficient operation of 
Government involved a certain degree of overlapping and that the theory of 
checks and balances required each organ to impede too great an 
aggrandizement of authority by the other two powers. As Holdsworth says, 
Montesquieu convinced the world that he had discovered a new constitutional 
130  
Page 130 
principle which was universally valid. The doctrine of separation of 
governmental powers is not a mere theoretical, philosophical concept. It is a 
practical, work-a-day principle. The division of Government into three 
branches does not imply, as its critics would have us think, three watertight 
compartments. Thus. legislative impeachment of executive officers or iudoes  
executive veto over legislation iudicial review of administrative or legislative  
actions are treated as partial exceptions which need explanation. (See 
generally: the Doctrine of Separation of Powers and its present day 
significance" by T. Vanderbilt.) 
xxx 	
xxx 	
xxx 
343. 	
I think clause (4) is bad for the reasons which I have already 
summarised. Clauses (1) to (3) of Article 329-A are severable but I express no 
opinion on their validity as it is not necessary for deciding this case. 
xxx 	
xxx 	
xxx 
361. 	
I therefore hold that these Acts are not liable to be challenged on any 
of the grounds argued by Counsel." 
57. 	
Insofar as the third judgment in the series of judgments is concerned, 
reference may be made to Minerva Mills Ltd. & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors., 
(1980) 2 SCC 591, as also, Minerva Mills Ltd. & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors., 
(1980) 3 SCC 625. Insofar as the former of the above two judgments is 
concerned, the same delineates the pointed controversy dealt with by a 
constitution bench of 5 Judges of this Court. The issue adjudicated upon, 
pertained to the constitutional validity of the Constitution (Forty-second 
Amendment) Act, 1976. and more particularly, Sections 4 and 55 thereof, 
whereby Articles 31C and 368 of the Constitution, came to be amended. The 
majority view was expressed in the ratio of 4:1, P.N. Bhagwati, J. (as he then 
was) having rendered the dissent. The majority arrived at the conclusion, that 
Section 4 of the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 was beyond 
the amending power of the Parliament and was void, as it had the effect of 
violating the basic or essential features of the Constitution and destroying the 
131

g 
'basic structure" of the Constitution, by a total exclusion of a challenge to any 
law, even on the ground that it was inconsistent with, or had taken away, or had 
abridged any of the rights, conferred by Articles 14 or 19 of the Constitution. 
Likewise, Section 55 of the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act was 
struck down as unconstitutional, as the same was beyond the amending power of 
the Parliament. 	
Relevant observations recorded in the instant judgment 
pertaining to the issue in hand, are being extracted hereunder. The opinion 
expressed by Y.V. Chandrachud, CJ, A.C. Gupta, N.L. Untawalia and RS. 
Kailasam, JJ. on the subject in hand, was to the following effect:- 
[ 68. 	
We must ... mention, what is perhaps not fully realised, that Article 31- 
C speaks of laws giving effect to the "policy of the State", "towards securing all 
or any of the principles laid down in Part IV". In the very nature of things it is 
difficult for a court to determine whether a particular law gives effect to a 
particular policy. Whether a law is adequate enough to give effect to the policy 
of the State towards securing a directive principle is always a debatable 
question and the courts cannot set aside the law as invalid merely because, in 
their opinion, the law is not adequate enough to give effect to a certain policy. 
In fact though the clear intendment of Article 31-C is to shut out all iudicial  
review the argument of the learned Additional Solicitor-General calls for a  
doubly or trebly extensive iudicial review than is even normally permissible to  
the courts. Be it remembered that the power to enquire into the question  
whether there is a direct and reasonable nexus between the provisions of a  
law and a directive principle cannot confer upon the courts the power to sit in  
judgment over the policy itself of the State. At the highest. courts can under  
Article 31-C. satisfy themselves as to the identity of the law in the sense  
whether it bears direct and reasonable nexus with a directive principle. If the  
court is satisfied as to the existence of such nexus the inevitable  
consequence provided for by Article 31-C must follow. Indeed. if there is one 
topic on which all the 13 Judges in Kesavananda Bharafi, (1973) 4 SCC 225, 
were agreed, it is this: that the only question open to judicial review under the 
unamended Adele 31-C was whether there is a direct and reasonable nexus 
between the impugned law and the provisions of Article 39(b) and (c) 
Reasonableness is evidently regarding the nexus and not regarding the law. It 
is therefore impossible to accept the contention that it is open to the courts to  
undertake the kind of enquiry suggested by the Additional Solicitor General.

The attempt therefore to drape Article 31-C into a democratic outfit under  
which an extensive judicial review would be permissible must fail.

.73. 	
It was finally urged by the learned Attorney General that if we uphold  
the challenge to the validity of Article 31-C the validity of clauses (2) to (61 of  
Article 19 will be gravely imperilled because those clauses will also then be  
table to be struck down as abrogating the rights conferred by Article 19(1)  
which are an essential feature of the Constitution. We are unable to accept  
this contention. Under clauses (2) to (6) of Article 19. restrictions can be  
imposed only if they are reasonable and then again. they can be imposed in  
the interest of a stated class of subiects only, It is for the courts to decide  
whether restrictions are reasonable and whether they are in the interest of the  
particular subject. Apart from other basic dissimilarities Article 31-C takes  
away the power of iudicial review to an extent which destroys even the  
semblance of a comparison between its 	
n and those of clauses (2) to  
(6) of Article 19. Human ingenuity limitless though it may be has vet not  
devised a system by which the liberty of the people can be protected except  
through the intervention of courts of law.

75. These then are our reasons for the Order (See Minerva Mills Ltd. vs. 
Union of India, (1980) 2 SCC 591) which we passed on May 9, 1980 to the 
following effect: (SCC pp. 592-593, paras 1 & 2) 
"Section 4 of the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act is beyond 
the amending power of the Parliament and is void since it damages the 
basic or essential features of the Constitution and destroys its basic 
structure by a total exclusion of challenge to any law on the ground that 
it is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights 
conferred by Article 14 or Article 19 of the Constitution, if the law is for 
giving effect to the policy of the State towards securing all or any of the 
principles laid down in Part IV of the Constitution. 
Section 55 of the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act is beyond 
the amending power of the Parliament and is void since it removes all 
limitations on the power of the Parliament to amend the Constitution 
and confers power upon it to amend the Constitution so as to damage 
or destroy its basic or essential features or its basic structure." 
In order to appreciate the minority view on the issue, reference may be made to 
the following observations of P.N. Bhagwati, 
"87, 	
It is a fundamental principle of our constitutional scheme and I have  
pointed this out in the preceding paragraph. that every organ of the State,  
every authority under the Constitution derives its power from the Constitution  
and has to act within the limits of such power. But then the Question arises as  
133 
Page 133 
-7934 - 
to which authority must decide what are the limits on the power conferred  
upon each organ or instrumentality of the State and whether such limits are  
transgressed or exceeded. Now there are three main departments of the 
State amongst which the powers of government are divided; the executive, 
the legislature and the judiciary. Under our Constitution we have no rigid 
separation of powers as in the United States of America, but there is a broad 
demarcation. though, having regard to the complex nature of governmental 
functions, certain degree of overlapping is inevitable. The reason for this 
broad separation of powers is that "the concentration of powers in any one 
organ may to quote the words of Chandrachud, J., (as he then was) in Indira 
Gandhi case, 1975 Supp SCC 1, by upsetting that fine balance between the 
three organs, destroy the fundamental premises of a democratic government 
to which we are pledged''. Take for example a case where the executive  
which is in charge of administration acts to the prejudice of a citizen and a  
question arises as to what are the powers of the executive and whether the  
executive has acted within the scope of its powers. Such a question obviously  
cannot be left to the executive to decide and for two very good reasons. First  
the decision of the question would depend upon the interpretation of the  
Constitution and the laws and this would ore-eminently be a matter fit to be  
decided by the iudiciarv. because it is the judiciary which alone would be  
possessed of expertise in this field and secondly the constitutional and legal  
protection afforded to the citizen would become illusory if it were left to the  
executive to determine the legality of its own action. So also if the legislature  
makes a law and a dispute arises whether in making the law the legislature  
has acted outside the area of its legislative competence or the law is violative  
of the fundamental rights or of any other provisions of the Consttution its  
resolution cannot. for the same reasons be left to the determination of the  
egislature. The Constitution has therefore created an independent  
machinery for resolving these disputes and this independent machinery is the  
udiciary which is vested with the power of judicial review to determine the  
egalitv of executive action and the validity of legislation passed by the  
legislature. It is the solemn duty of the iudiciaG under the Constitution to keep  
he different organs of the State such as the executive and the legislature  
within the limits of the power conferred upon them by the Constitution. This 
power of judicial review is conferred on the judiciary by Articles 32 and 226 of 
he Constitution. Speaking about draft Article 25, corresponding to present 
Article 32 of the Constitution, Dr Ambedkar, the principal architect of our 
Constitution, said in the Constituent Assembly on December 9, 1948: 
"If I was asked to name any particular Article in this Constitution as the 
most important — an Article without which this Constitution would be a 
nullity — I could not refer to any other Article except this one. It is the 
very soul of the Constitution and the very heart of it and I am glad that 
the House has realised its importance. (CAD, Vol. 7, ff 953)" 
It is a cardinal principle of our Constitution that no one howsoever highly 
placed and no authority however lofty can claim to be the sole judge of its 
134 
Page 134 
power under the Constitution or whether its action is within the confines of 
such power laid down by the Constitution. The iudiciane is the interpreter of  
the Constitution and to the judiciary is assigned the delicate task to determine  
what is the power conferred on ach branch of government whether it is  
limited and if so what are the limits and whether any action of that branch  
transgresses such limits. It is for the iudiciary to uphold the constitutional  
values and to enforce the constitutional limitations. That is the essence of the 
rule of law, which inter alia requires that ''the exercise of powers by the 
government whether it be the legislature or the executive or any other 
authority, be conditioned by the Constitution and the law". The power of 
judicial review is an inteoral part of our constitutional system and without it  
there 'II be 	
ovemment of laws and the rule of law would become a  
teasing illusion and a promise of unreality. I am of the view that if there is one  
feature of our Constitution which more than any other is basic and  
fundamental to the maintenance of democracy and the rule of law it is the  
power of judicial review and it is unquestionably to my mind part of the basic  
structure of the Constitution. Of course when I say this I should not be taken  
to suggest that effective alternative institutional mechanisms or arrangements  
for judicial review cannot be made by Parliament But what I wish to  
emphasise is that iudicial review is a vital principle of our Constitution and it  
cannot be abrogated without affecting the basic structure of the Constitution. If 
by a constitutional amendment, the power of judicial review is taken away and 
it is provided that the validity of any law made by the legislature shall not be 
liable to be called in question on any ground, even if it is outside the 
legislative competence of the legislature or is violative of any fundamental 
rights, it would be nothing short of subversion of the Constitution, for it would 
make a mockery of the distribution of legislative powers between the Union 
and the States and render the fundamental rights meaningless and futile. So 
also if a constitutional amendment is made which has the effect of taking  
away the power of iudicial review and providing that no amendment made in  
the Constitu ion shall be liable to be questioned on any ground. even if such  
amendment is violative of the basic structure and therefore outside the  
amendatory power of Parliament it would be making Parliament sole iudae of  
the consfitutonal validity of what it has done and that would in effect and  
substance nullify the limitation on the amending power of Parliament and  
affect the basic structure of the Constitution. The conclusion must therefore 
inevitably fol ow that clause (4) of Article 368 is unconstitutional and void as 
damaging the basic structure of the Constitution. 
88. 	
That takes us to clause (5) of Article 368. This clause opens with the 
words for  the removal of doubts" and proceeds to declare that there shall be 
no limitation whatever on the amending power of Parliament under Article 
368. It is difficult to appreciate the meaning of the opening words for the 
removal of doubts" because the majority decision in Kesavananda Bharati 
case (supra) clearly laid down and left no doubt that the basic structure of the 
Constitution was outside the competence of the amendatory power of 
135 
Page 135 
0236  - 
Parliament and in Indira Gandhi case (supra), all the judges unanimously 
accepted theory of the basic structure as a theory by which the validity of the 
amendment impugned before them, namely, Article 329-A(4) was to be 
judged. Therefore. after the decisions in Kesavananda Bharat case (supra)  
and Indira Gandhi case (supra)_ there was no doubt at all that the amendatory  
power of Parliament was I mited and it was not competent to Parliament to  
alter the basic structure of the Constitution and clause (5) could not remove  
the doubt which did not exist What clause (51 really sought to do was to  
remove the limitation on the amendino power of Parliament and convert it  
from a limited power into an unlimited one. This was clearly and indubitably a  
futile exercise on the part of Parliament. I fail to see how Parliament which  
has only a limited power of amendment and which cannot alter the basic  
structure of the Constitution can expand its power of amendment so as to  
confer upon itself the power of repeal or abrogate the Constitution or to  
damage or destroy its basic structure. That would clearly be in excess of the  
limited amendino power possessed by Parliament. The Constitution has  
conferred only a limited amending power on Parliament so that it cannot  
damage or destroy the basic structure of the Constitution and Parliament  
cannot by exercise of that limited amending power convert that very power  
into an absolute and unlimited power. If it were permissible to Parliament to 
enlarge the limited amending power conferred upon it into an absolute power 
of amendment, then it was meaningless to place a limitation on the original 
power of amendment. It is difficult to appreciate how Parliament having a 
limited power of amendment can get rid of the limitation by exercising that 
very power and convert it into an absolute power. Clause (51 of Article 368  
which sought to remove the limitation on the amending power of Parliament  
by making it absolute must therefore be held to be outside the amending  
power of Parliament. There is also another ground on which the validity of this  
clause can be successfully assailed. This clause seeks to convert a controlled  
Constitution into an uncontrolled one by removing the limitation on the  
arnerp
lin ower of Parliament which as pointed out above is itself an  
essential feature of the Constitution and it is therefore violative of the basic  
structure. I would in the circumstances hold clause (5) of Article 368 to be  
unconstitutional and void: 
58. Reference may now be made to another decision of this Court rendered by 
a bench of 7 Judges, namely, SP_ Gupta v. Union of India, 1981 (Supp.) SCC 
87. P.N. Bhagwati, J. (as he then was) opined as under:- 
"Concept of Independence of the Judiciary 
27. 	
Having disposed of the preliminary objection in regard to locus standi 
of the petitioners, we may now proceed to consider the questions which arise 
136 
Page 136 
for determination in these writ petitions. The Questions are of great  
constitutional significance affecting the principle of independence of the  
judiciary which is a basic feature of the Constitution and we would therefore  
prefer to begin the discussion by making a few prefatory remarks highlighting 
what the true function of the judiciary should be in a country like India which is  
marching along the road to social justice with the banner of democracy and  
the rule of law for the principle of independence of the iudiciary is not an  
abstract conception but it is a living faith which must derive its inspiration from  
the constitutional charter and its nourishment and sustenance from the  
constitutional values. It is necessary for every Judge to remember constantly 
and continually that our Constitution is not a non-aligned national charter. It is 
a document of social revolution which casts an obligation on every 
instrumentality including the judiciary, which is a separate but equal branch of 
the State, to transform the status quo ante into a new human order in which 
justice, social, economic and political will inform all institutions of national life 
and there will be equality of status and opportunity for all. 	
Now this 
approach to the judicial function may be alright for a stable and static society 
but not for a society pulsating with urges of gender justice, worker justice. 
minorities justice, daft justice and equal justice, between chronic unequals. 
Where the contest is between those who are socially or economically 
unequal, the judicial process may prove disastrous from the point of view of 
social justice, if the Judge adopts a merely passive or negative role and does 
not adopt a positive and creative approach. The judiciary cannot remain a 
mere bystander or spectator but it must become an active participant in the 
judicial process ready to use law in the service of social justice through a pro-
active goal-oriented approach. But this cannot be achieved unless we have 
judicial cadres who share the fighting faith of the Constitution and who are 
imbued with the constitutional values. The necessity of a judiciary which is in 
tune with the social philosophy of the Cons itution has nowhere been better 
emphasised than in the words of Justice Krishna lyer which we quote: 
"Appointment of Judges is a serious process where judicial expertise, 
legal learning, life's experience and h gh integrity are components, but 
above all are two indispensables — social philosophy in active unison 
with the socialistic articles of the Constitution, and second, but equally 
important, built-in resistance to pushes and pressures by class 
'nterests, private prejudices, government threats and blandishments, 
party loyalties and contrary economic and politicial ideologies projecting 
'nto pronouncements. (Mainstream, November 22, 1980)" 
Justice Krishna lyer goes on to say in his inimitable style: 
'Justice Cardozo approvingly quoted President Theodore Roosevelt's 
stress on the social philosophy of the Judges, which shakes and 
shapes the course of a nation and, therefore, the choice of Judges for 
the higher Courts which makes and declares the law of the land, must 
be in tune with the social philosophy of the Constitution. Not mastery of 
the law alone, but social vis on and creative craftsmanship are 
137 
Page 137 
Important inputs in successful justicing. (Mainstream, November 22, 
1980)° 
What is necessary is to have Judges who are prepared to fashion new tools, 
forge new methods, innovate new strategies and evolve a new jurisprudence, 
who are judicial statesmen with a social vision and a creative faculty and. who 
have, above all, a deep sense of commitment to the Constitution with an 
activist approach and obligation for accountability, not to any party in power 
nor to the opposition nor to the classes which are vociferous but to the half-
hungry millions of India who are continually denied their basic human rights. 
We need Judges who are alive to the socio-economic realities of Indian life, 
who are anxious to wipe every tear from every eye, who have faith in the 
constitutional values and who are ready to use law as an instrument for 
achieving the constitutional objectives. This has to be the broad blueprint of 
he appointment project for the higher echelons of judicial service. It is only if  
appointments  of Judges are made with these considerations weighing  
predominantly with the appointing authority that we can have a truly  
independent iudiciary committed only to the Constitution and to the people of  
ndia. The concept of independence of the iudiciary is a noble concept which  
itpires the constitutional scheme and constitutes the foundation on which  
rests the edifice of our democratic polity. If there is one principle which runs  
hrough the entire fabric of the Constitution it is the principle of the rule of law  
and under the Constitution it is the judiciary which is entrusted with the task  
of keeping every organ of the State within the limits of the law and thereby  
making the rule of law meaningful and effective. It is to aid the iudiciary in this  
task that the power of judicial review has been conferred upon the iudiciary  
and it is by exercising this power which constitutes one of the most potent  
weapons in armory of the law that the iudiciary seeks to protect the citizen  
against violation of his constitutional or legal rights or misuse or abuse of  
power by the Slate or its officers. The judiciary stands between the citizen and  
he State as a bulwark against executive excesses and misuse or abuse of  
power by the executive and therefore it is absolutely essential that the  
udiciary must be free from executive pressure or influence and this has been  
secured by the Constitution-makers by making elaborate provisions in the  
Constitution to which detailed reference has been made in the judgments in 
Union of India vs. Sankalchand Himmatlal Sheth, (1977) 4 SCC 193 But it is  
necessary to remind ourselves that the concept of independence of the  
judiciary is not limited only to independence from executive pressure or  
influence but it is a much wider concept which takes within its sweep  
independence from many other pressures and prejudices. It has many  
dimensions namely. fearlessness of other power centres. economic or  
political and freedom from preiudices acquired and nourished by the class to  
which the Judges belong. If we may again quote the eloquent words of Justice 
Krishna lyer: 
Independence of the Judiciary is not genuflexion; nor is it opposition 
to every proposition of Government. It is neither Judiciary made to 
138 
Page 138 
a 37 
Opposition measure nor Government's pleasure. (Mainstream, 
November 22, 1980) 
The tycoon, the communalist, the parochialist, the faddist, the 
extremist and radical reactionary lying coiled up and subconsciously . 
shaping judicial mentations are menaces to judicial independence 
when they are at variance with Parts III and IV of the Paramount 
Parchment." 
Judges should be of stern stuff and tough fibre unbending before power  
economic or political and they must uphold the core principle of the rule of  
law which says "Be you ever so high the law is above you  This is the  
principle of independence of the judiciary which is vital for the establishment  
of real participatory democracy maintenance of the rule of law as a dynamic  
concept and delivery of social justice to the vulnerable sections of the  
community. It is this principle of independence of the judiciary which we must  
keep in mind while interpreting the relevant provisions of the Constitution." 
 
S. Murtaza Fazal Ali, J., on the issue of "judicial review" and the 'basic structure", 
opined as under.- 
“332. It would appear that our Constitution has devised a wholesome and  
effective mechanism for the appointment of Judges which strikes a lust  
balance between the iudicial and executive powers so that while the final  
appointment vests in the highest authority of the executive the power is  
subject to a mandatory consultative process which by convention is entitled to  
great weight by the President. Apart from these safety valves. checks and  
balances at every stage where the power of the President is abused or  
misused or violates any of the constitutional safeguards it is always subject to  
judicial review. The power of Judicial review which has been conceded by the  
Constitution to the iudiciary is in our opinion the safest possible safeguard not 
only to ensure independence of iudiciary but also to prevent it from the  
vagaries of the executive. Another advantage of the method adopted by our 
Constitution is that by vesting the entire power in the President, the following 
important elements are introduced.  
(1) 
a popular element in the matter of administration of justice, 
(2) 
linking with judicial system the dynamic goals of a progressive 
society by subjecting the principles of governance to be guided by the 
Directive Principles of State Policy, 
(3) 
in order to make the judiciary an effective and powerful machinery, 
the Constitution contains a most onerous and complicated system by 
which Judges can be removed under Article 124(4), which in practice is 
almost an impossibility, 
(4) 
in order to create and subserve democratic processes the power of 
appointment of the judiciary in the executive has been so vested that the

This Court has in several cases held that the condition of consultation 
which the Governor has to exercise implies that he would have to respect the 
recommendations of the High Court and cannot turn it down without cogent 
reasons and even if he does so, it is manifest that his order is always subject 
to judicial review on the ground of mala fide or exceeding his jurisdiction.

345. This, therefore, disposes of all the contentions of the counsel for the 
parties so far as the various aspects of interpretation of Article 222 are 
concerned. On a consideration, therefore, of the facts, circumstances and 
authorities the position is as follows: 
(1) that Article 222 expressly excludes 'consent' and it is not possible to 
read the word 'consent' into Article 222 and thereby whittle down the 
power conferred on the President under this Article, 
(2) that the transfer of a Judge or a C.J. of a High Court under Article 222 
must be made in public interest or national interest, 
(3) that non-consensual transfer does not amount to punishment or 
involve any stigma, 
(4) that in suitable cases where male fide is writ large on the face of it, an 
order of transfer made by the President would be subject to judicial review, 
(5) that the transfer of a Judge from one High Court to another does not 
amount to a first or fresh appointment in any sense of the term, 
(6) that a transfer made under Article 222 after complying with the 
conditions and circumstances mentioned above does not mar or erode the 
independence of judiciary.

402. 	
It has been vehemently argued by Mr. Seervai as also by Mr. 
Sorabjee who followed him that their main concern is that independence of 
judiciary should be maintained at all costs. Indeed, if they are really 
concerned that we should build up an independent judiciary then it is 
absolutely essential that new talents from outside should be imported in every 
High Court either to man it or to head it so that they may generate much 
greater confidence in the people than the local Judges. The position of a C.J. 
Is indeed a very high constitutional position and our Constitution contains 
sufficient safeguards to protect both his decision-making process and his 
tenure. It is a well-known saying that power corrupts and absolute power 
corrupts absolutely. As man is not infallible, so is a Chief Justice, though a 
person holding a high judicial post is likely to be incorruptible because of the 
quality of sobriety and restraint that the judicial method contains. Even so, if a 
C.J. is from outside the State, the chances of his misusing his powers are 
reduced to the absolute minimum. We have pointed out that the power to 
formulate or evolve this policy clearly lies within the four-corners of Article 222 
itself which contains a very wide power conditioned only by consultation with 
140 
Page 140 
C.J.I. who is the highest judicial authority in the country. It is always open to 
the President, which in practice means the Central Government, to lay down a 
policy, norms and guidelines according to which the presidential powers are to 
be exercised and once these norms are followed, the powers of the President 
would be beyond judicial review. 
On the issue in hand, V.D. Tulzapurkar, J. expressed the following view:- 
"624. 	
As regards the constitutional convention or practice and the 
undertaking which have been pressed into service in relation to Bar recruits 
as Additional Judges for basing their right to be considered for their 
continuance on the expiry of their initial term, the learned Attorney-General 
appearing for the Union of India raised a two fold contention. Regarding the 
former he urged that a constitutional convention or practice, howsoever 
wholesome, cannot affect, alter or control the plain meaning of Article 224(1) 
which according to him gives absolute power and complete discretion to the 
President in the matter of continuance of sitting Additional Judges on the 
expiry of their initial term, the pendency of arrears being relevant only for 
deciding whether or not Additional Judges should be appointed and not 
relevant with regard to a particular person to be appointed. As regards the 
undertaking he pointed out that the usual undertaking obtained from a 
Member of the Bar in all High Courts — and for that matter even the additional 
undertaking that is being obtained in the Bombay High Court if properly read 
will show that it merely creates a binding obligation on the concerned Member 
of the Bar but does not create any.  Abligation or commitment on the part of the 
appointing authority to make the offer of permanent Judgeship to him. It is 
difficult to accept either of these contentions of the learned Attorney General. 
It was not disputed before us that constitutional conventions and practices 
have importance under unwritten as well as written Constitutions and the 
position that conventions have a role to play in interpreting articles of a 
Constitution is clear from several decided cases. In U.N.R. Rao v. Indira 
Gandhi, (1971) 2 SCC 63, Chief Justice Sikri observed thus: (SCC p. 64, para 
3) 
"It was said that we must interpret Article 75(3) according to its own 
terms regardless of the conventions that prevail in the United Kingdom. 
If the words of an Article are clear. notwithstanding any relevant 
convention, effect will no doubt be given to the words. But it must be 
remembered that we are interpreting a Constitution and not an Act of 
Parliament, a Constitution which establishes a Parliamentary system of 
Government with a Cabinet. In trying to understand one may well keep 
in mind the conventions prevalent at the time the Constitution was 
framed." 
In State of Rajasthan v. Union of India, (1977) 3 SCC 592, also the 
importance of a constitutional convention or practice by way of crystallising 
the otherwise vague and loose content of a power to be found in certain 
article has been emphasised. In the State of W13. v, Nripendra Nath Bagcht 
141 
Page 141 
AIR 1966 SC 447, the entire interpretation of the concept of vesting of control' 
over District Courts and Courts subordinate thereto in the High Court was 
animated by conventions and practices having regard to the history, object 
and purpose that lay behind the group of relevant articles, the principal 
purpose being, the securing of the independence of the subordinate judiciary. 
It is true that no constitut onal convention or practice can affect, alter or 
control the operation of any article if its meaning is quite plain and clear but 
here Article 224(1) merely provides for situations when Additional Judges 
from duly qualified persons could be appointed to a High Court and at the 
highest reading the article with Section 14 of the General Clauses Act it can 
be said that the power conferred by that article may be exercised from time to 
time as occasion requires but on the question as to whether when the 
occasion arises to make appointment on expiry of the term of a sitting 
Additional Judge whether he should be continued or a fresher or outsider 
could be appointed by ignoring the erstwhile incumbent even when arrears 
continue to obtain in that High Court the article is silent and not at all clear and 
hence the principle invoked by the learned Attorney-General will not apply. On 
the other hand, it will be proper to invoke in such a situation the other well-
settled principle that in construing a constitutional provision the implications 
which arise from the structure of the Constitution itself or from its scheme may 
legitimately be made and looking at Article 224(1) from this angle a 
wholesome constitutional convention or practice that has grown because of 
such implications will have to be borne in mind especially when it servesto 
safeguard one of the basic features which is the cardinal faith underlying our 
Constitution, namely, independence of the judiciary. In other words a limitation 
on the otherwise absolute power and discretion contained in Article 224(1) is 
required to be read into it because of the clear implication arising from the 
said cardinal faith which forms a fundamental pillar supporting the basic 
structure of the Constitution, as otherwise the exercise of the power in the 
absolute manner as suggested will be destructive of the same. That it is not 
mind approach to embark upon 'a strict literal reach' of any constitutional 
provision in order to determine its true ambit and effect is strikingly illustrated 
'n the case of Article 368 which came up for consideration before this Court in 
Kesavananda Bharat] case. (1973) 4 SCC 225, where this Court held that the 
basic or essential features of the Constitution do act as fetters or limitations 
on the otherwise wide amending power contained in that article. In Australia 
limitations on the law-making powers of the Parliament of the Federal 
Commonwealth over the States were read into the concerned provisions of 
the Constitution because of implications arising from the very federal nature of 
the Constitution: (vide Lord Mayor Councillors and Citizens ft the City of 
Melbourne v. Commonwealth, 74 Commonwealth LR 31, and he State of 
Victoria v. Commonwealth of Australia. 122 Commonwealth LR 353). As 
regards the undertakings of the types mentioned above, it is true that strictly 
and legally speaking these undertakings only create a binding obligation on 
the concerned Member of the Bar and not on the appointing authority but it 
142 
Page 142 
a2113 
cannot be forgotten that when such undertakings were thought of, the 
postulate underlying the same was that there was no question of the 
appointing authority not making the offer of permanent Judgeship to the 
concerned Member of the Bar but that such an offer would be made and upon 
the same being made the sitting Additional Judge recruited from the Bar 
should not decline to accept it and revert to the Bar. I am therefore clearly of 
the view that the aforesaid convention or practice and the undertaking serve 
the cause of public interest in two respects as indicated above and those two 
aspects of public interest confer upon these sitting Additional Judges recruited 
from the Bar a legitimate expectancy and the enforceable right not to be 
dropped illegally or at the whim or caprice of the appointing authority but to be 
considered for continuance in that High Court either by way of extending their 
term or making them permanent in preference to freshers or outsiders and it is 
impossible to construe Article 224(1) as conferring upon the appointing 
authority absolute power and complete discretion in the matter of appointment 
of Additional Judges to a High Court as suggested and the suggested 
construction has to be rejected. In view of the above discussion it is clear that 
there is a valid classification between proposed appointees for initial 
recruitment and the sitting Additional Judges whose cases for their 
continuance after the expiry of their initial term are to be decided and the two 
are not in the same position.° 
The observations of D.A. Desai, J. are expressed hereunder:- 
"696. It may be briefly mentioned here that Writ Petition No. 274 of 1981 
filed in this Court and Transferred Cases Nos. 2. 6 and 24 of 1981 were listed 
to be heard along with the present batch of cases with a view to avoiding the 
repetition of the arguments on points common to both sets of cases. In the 
first group of cases the question of construction of Articles 217, 224 and other 
connected articles prominently figured in the context of circular of the Law 
Minister dated March 18, 1981, seeking consent of Additional Judges for 
being appointed as permanent Judges in other High Courts and the short-
term extensions given to Shri O.N. Vohra, Shri S.N. Kumar and Shri S.B. 
Wad, Additional Judges of Delhi High Court and the final non-appointment of 
Shri O.N. Vohra and Shri S.N. Kumar. The submission was that the circular of 
the Law Minister manifests a covert attempt to transfer Additional Judges from 
one High Court to other High Court without consulting the Chief Justice of 
India as required by Article 222(1) and thereby circumventing the majority 
decision in Union of India v. Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth, (1977) 4 SCC 193. 
The central theme was the scope, ambit and content of consultation which the 
President must have with the three constitutional functionaries set out in 
Article 217(1). In the second group of cases, the question arose in the context 
of transfer of Shri K.B.N. Singh, Chief Justice of Patna High Court as Chief 
Justice of Madras High Court consequent upon the transfer of Shri M.M. 
Ismail, Chief Justice of Madras High Court as Chief Justice of Kerala High 
Court by Presidential Notification dated January 19, 1981, in exercise of the 
143 
Page 193 
power conferred upon him by Article 222 The controversy centred down the 
scope, ambit and content of consultation that the President must have with 
the Chief Justice of India before exercising the power to transfer under Article 
222. Thus, the scope, ambit and content of consultation under Article 217 as 
also one of Article 222 which, as Mr Seervai stated. was more or less the 
same though the different facets on which consultation must be focussed may 
differ in the case of transfer and in the case of appointment, figured 
prominently in both the groups of cases. The parameters of scope. ambit and 
content of consultation both under Articles 217(1), 222 and 224, were drawn 
on a wide canvas to be tested on the touchstone of independence of judiciary 
being the fighting faith and fundamental and basic feature of the Constitution. 
It was stated that if the consultation itself is to provide a reliable safeguard 
against arbitrary and naked exercise of power against judiciary, the procedure 
of consultation must be so extensive as to cover all aspects of the matter and 
it must be made so firm and rigid that any contravention or transgression of it 
would be treated as male fide or subversive of independence of judiciary and 
the decision can be corrected by judicial review. Therefore, at the outset it is 
necessary to be properly informed as to the concept of independence of 
Judiciary as set out in the Constitution. 
697. 	
The entire gamut of arguments revolved principally round the 
construction of Articles 217 and 224 in one batch of petitions and Article 222 
in another batch but the canvas was spread wide covering various other 
articles of the Constitution, analogous provisions in previous Government of 
India Acts, similar provisions in other democratic constitutions and reports of 
Law Commission. Rival constructions canvassed centred upon the pivotal 
assumption that independence of judiciary is a basic and fundamental feature 
of the Constitution which has its genesis in the power of judicial review which 
enables the court to declare executive and legislative actions ultra vires the 
Constitution. In this connection we are not starting on a clean slate as the 
contention in this very form and for an avowed object was widely canvassed 
in Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth v. Union of India, (1976) 17 Guj LR 1017 (FB), 
and in Union of India v. Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth (supra). Some additional 
dimensions were added to this basic concept of independence of judiciary 
while both the parties vied with each other as in the past (see statement of 
Shri S.V. Gupte, then Attorney-General in Sheth case (supra), on proclaiming 
their commitment to independence of judiciary though in its scope and content 
and approach there was a marked divergence.

Now, power is conferred on the President to make appointment of 
Judge of Supreme Court after consultation with such of the Judges of the 
Supreme Court and of the High Courts in the States as the President may 
deem necessary. The submission is that the expression 'may deem 
necessary qualifies the expression 'consultation' and that if he deems 
otherwise the President can proceed to make appointment of the Chief 
Justice of India without consultation with any of the Judges of the Supreme 
144 
Page 144 
Court and of the High Courts. In other words, it was submitted on behalf of the 
respondents, the President has a discretion to consult or not to consult 
Judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts before making appointment of 
Chief Justice of India. It was pointed out that where consultation is obligatory 
it is specifically provided and reference was made to the proviso extracted 
hereinabove wherein it is stated that it would be obligatory upon the President 
to consult the Chief Justice of India before making appointment of a Judge of 
the Supreme Court other than the Chief Justice of India. Undoubtedly, the 
proviso leaves no option to the President but to consult the Chief Justice of 
India while making appointment of a Judge of the Supreme Court other than 
the Chief Justice of India, but it is rather difficult to accept the construction as 
suggested on behalf of the respondents that in making appointment of the 
Chief Justice of India the President is at large and may not consult any 
functionary in the judicial branch of the State before making appointment of 
Chief Justice of India. The expression 'may .deem necessary' qualifies the 
number of Judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts to be consulted. 
What is optional is selection of number of Judges to be consulted and not the 
consultation because the expression 'shall be appointed after consultation' 
would mandate consultation. An extreme submission that the President may 
consult High Court Judges for appointment of the Chief Justice of India 
omitting altogether Supreme Court Judges does not commend to us, because 
the consultation with 'such of the Judges of the Supreme Court and of the 
High Courts' would clearly indicate that the consultat'on has to be with some 
Judges of the Supreme Court and some Judges of the High Courts. The 
conjunction 'and' is clearly indicative of the intendment of the framers of the 
Constitution. If there was disjunctive 'or' between Supreme Court and High 
Courts in sub-article (2) of Article 124 there could have been some force in 
the submission that the President may appoint Chief Justice of India ignoring 
the Supreme Court and after consulting some High Court Judges. 
Undoubtedly. sub-article (2) does not cast an obligation to consult all Judges 
of the Supreme Court and all Judges of the High Courts but in practical 
working the President in order to discharge his function of selecting the best 
suitable person to be the Chief Justice of India must choose such fair 
sprinkling of Supreme Court and High Court Judges as would enable him to 
gather enough and relevant material which would help him in decision-making 
process. Mr Seervai submitted that this Court must avoid such construction of 
Article 124 which would enable the President to appoint Chief Justice of India 
without consultation with any judicial functionaries. That is certainly correct. 
But then he proceeded to suggest a construction where, by a constitutional 
convention. any necessity of consultation would be obviated and yet the 
executive power to be choosy and selective in appointment of Chief Justice of 
India can be controlled or thwarted. He said that a constitutional convention 
must be read that the seniormost amongst the puisne Judges of the Supreme 
Court should as a rule be appointed as Chief Justice of India except when he 
is physically unfit to shoulder the responsibilities. This constitutional 
145 
Page 145 
convention, it was said, when read in Article 124(2) would obviate any 
necessity of consultation with any functionary in the judicial branch before 
making appointment of Chief Justice of India and yet would so circumscribe 
the power of the President as not to enable the executive to choose a person 
of its bend and thinking. In this very context it was pointed out that Article 126 
permits the President to appoint even the juniormost Judge of the Supreme 
Court to be an acting Chef Justice of India and it was said that such an 
approach or such construction of Article 128 would be subversive of the 
independence of judiciary. It was said that if the juniormost can be appointed 
acting Chief Justice of India, every Judge in order to curry favour would 
decide in favour of executive. And as far as Article 124 is concerned it was 
said that if the convention of seniority is not read in Article 124(2), every 
Judge of the Supreme Court would be a possible candidate for the office of 
Chief Justice of India and on account of personal bias would be disqualified 
from being consulted. There is no warrant for such an extreme posit on and 
the reflection on the Judges of the Supreme Court is equally unwarranted. On 
the construction as indicated above there will be positive limitation on the 
power of the President while making appointment of Chief Justice of India and 
it is not necessary to read any limitation on the power of the President under 
Article 126 while making appointment of a Judge of the Supreme Court as 
acting Chief Justice of India. But the observation is incidental to the 
submission and may be examined in an appropriate case. And the question of 
construction is kept open.

It was also stated that the expression 'obtain' in the circular has the 
element of coercion and a consent ceases to be consent if it is obtained under 
coercion. It was said that consent and coercion go ill together because forced 
assent would not be consent in the eye of law. It was said that the threat 
implicit in the circular becomes evident because the Chief Minister, the strong 
arm of the executive is being asked to obtain consent. If every little thing is 
looked upon with suspicion and as an attack on the independence of judiciary, 
it becomes absolutely misleading. Law Minister, if he writes directly to the 
Chief Justice or the Judge concerned, propriety of the action may be open to 
question. Chandrachud, J., has warned in Sheth case (supra) that the 
executive cannot and ought not to establish rapport with Judges (SCR p. 456 
CD' SCC p. 230, para 43). Taking this direction in its letter and spirit, the Law 
Minister wrote to the Chief Ministers. The Chief Minister in turn was bound to 
approach the Chief Justice. This is also known to be a proper communication 
channel with Judges of High Court. In this context the expression 'obtain' 
would only mean request the Judge to give consent if he so desires. If he 
gives the consent, well and good, and if does not give, no evil consequences 
are likely to ensue. I am not impressed by the submission of the learned 
Attorney-General that one who gives consent may have some advantage over 
the one who does not. I do not see any remote advantage and if any such 
advantage is given and if charge of victimisation is made out by the Judge not 
146 
Page 146 
giving consent, the arm of judicial review is strong enough to rectify the 
executive error.

The public interest like public policy is an unruly horse and is 
incapable of any precise definition and, therefore, it was urged that this 
safeguard is very vague and of doubtful utility. It was urged that these 
safeguards failed to checkmate the arbitrary exercise of power in 1976. This 
approach overlooks the fact that the Lakshman Rekha drawn by the 
safeguards when transgressed or crossed, the judicial review will set at 
naught the mischief. True it is that it is almost next to impossible for individual 
Judge of a High Court to knock at the doors of the Courts because access to 
justice is via the insurmountable mountain of costs and expenses. This need 
not detain us because we have seen that in time of crisis the Bar has risen to 
the occasion twice over in near past though it must be conceded that judicial 
review is increasingly becoming the preserve of the high, mighty and the 
affluent. But the three safeguards, namely, full and effective consultation with 
the Chief Justice of India, and that the power to transfer can be exercised in 
public interest, and judicial review, would certainly insulate independence of 
judiciary against an attempt by the executive to control it." 
Last of all, reference may be made to the observations of E.S. Venkataramiah, 
J., (as he then was) who held as under.- 
"1245. The question of policy is a matter entirely for the President to decide. 
Even though the Chief Justice of India is consulted in that behalf by the 
President since the policy relates to the High Courts, his opinion is not binding 
on the President. It is open to the President to adopt any policy which is 
subject only to the judicial review by the Court. Under Article 222 of the 
Constitution the Chief Justice of India has to be consulted on the question 
whether a particular Judge should be transferred and where he should be 
transferred while implementing the said policy. If the Government requests the 
Chief Justice of India to give his opinion on a transfer to implement the said 
policy which is really in the public interest he cannot decline to do so. Even 
though the Chief Justice was opposed to the 'wholesale transfers of Judges 
there is no bar for the Government treating the recommendation for transfers 
made by the Chief Justice of India as a part of the implementation of its 
policy. That the transfer of Shri K.B.N. Singh was on account of the policy of 
the Government can be gathered from the following statements in the 
affidavits filed before this Court: In para 8 of the affidavit dated September 16, 
1981 of Shri K.B.N. Singh it is stated: When the deponent wanted to know 
why he might be transferred to Madras, the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India 
merely said that it was the Government policy, but gave no clue as to what 
necessitated his transfer from Patna to Madras.' In para 2(g) of the affidavit of 
the Chief Justice of India he has stated: "I deny that when Shri K.B.N. Singh 
147 
Page 147 
wanted to know over the telephone on January 5, 1981, I stated merely that it 
was the 'Government policy'....". In paragraph 8 of the rejoinder-affidavit 
dated October 16, 1981 of Shri K.B.N. Singh, it is stated at one point he also 
said that it was Government policy to effect transfer in batches of two or 
three". 
59. The sequence of judgments would now lead us to the judgment of this 
Court in S.P. Sampath Kumar v. Union of India, (1987) 1 SCC 124. The view 
expressed by a bench of 5 Hon'ble Judges of this Court in the above case, was 
in respect of a controversy quite similar to the one in hand. In the instant 
judgment, the constitutional tyres of the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985 was 
under challenge. The above Act was framed under Article 323A of the 
Constitution. Article 323A was introduced in the Constitution by the Constitution 
(Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976. The main judgment was delivered by 
Ranganath Misra, J. (as he then was) on behalf of himself and V. Khalid, G.L. 
Oza and M.M. Duff. JJ. Insofar as the concurring view rendered by P.N. 
Bhagyvati, CJ is concerned, the conclusion recorded in the following paragraphs 
has a bearing on the present controversy. 
It is now well settled as a (esult of the decision of this Court in Minerva  
Mills Ltd. v Union of India (1980) 3 SCC 625 that iudicial review is a basic  
and essential feature of the Constitution and no law passed by Parliament in  
exercise of its constituent power can abrogate it or take it away. If the power  
of judicial review is abrogated or taken away the Constitution will cease to be  
what it is. It is a fundamental principle of our constitutional scheme that even/  
organ of the State every authority under the Constitution derives its power  
from the Constitution and has to act within the limits of such power. It is a  
limited government which we have under the Constitution and both the  
executive and the legislature have to act within the limits of the power  
conferred upon them under the Constitution. Now a question may arise ffs to  
what are the powers of the executive and whether the executive has acted  
within the scope of its power. Such a question obviously cannot be left to the  
executive to decide and for two very good reasons. First the decision of the  
Question would depend upon the interpretation of the Constitution and the  
148 
Page 148 
- 	
-- 
laws and this would ore-eminent! be a matter ft to be decided b the  
judiciary because it is the iudiciary which alone would be possessed of  
expertise in this field and secondly the constitutional and legal protection  
afforded to the citizen would become illusory if it were left to the executive to  
determine the legality of its own action. So also if the legislature makes a law 
and a dispute arises whether in making the law, the legislature has acted 
outside the area of its legislative competence or the law is violative of the 
fundamental rights or of any other provisions of the Constitution, its resolution 
cannot, for the same reasons, be left to the determination of the legislature. 
The Constitution has, therefore created an independent machinery for 
resolving these disputes and this independent machinery is the judiciary 
which is vested with the power of judicial review to determine the legality of 
executive action and the validity of Jegislafion passed by the legislature. The  
judiciary is constituted the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution and to it is  
assigned the delicate task of determining what is the extent and scope of the  
power conferred on each branch of government what are the limits on the  
exercise of such power under the Constitution and whether any action of any  
branch transgresses such limits. It is also a basic principle of the rule of law  
which permeates event provision of the Constitution and which forms its very  
core and essence that the exercise of power by the executive or any other  
authority must not only be conditioned by the Constitution but also be in  
accordance with law and it is the judiciary which has to ensure that the law is  
observed and there is compliance with the requirements of law on the part of  
the executive and other authorities. This function is discharged by the  
judiciary by exercise of the power of judicial review which is a most potent  
weapon in the hands of the judiciary for maintenance of the Rule of Law. The  
power of iudicial review is an integral part of our constitutional system and  
without it there will be no government of laws and the Rule of Law would  
become a teasing illusion and a promise of unreality That is why I observed 
in my judgment in Minerva Mills Ltd. case (supra) at p. 287 and 288. (SCC p. 
678, pars 87) 
"I am of the view that if there is one feature of our Constitution which  
more than any other is basic and fundamental to the maintenance of  
democracy and the rule of law. it is the power of iudicial review and it is  
unquestionably. to my mind. part of the basic structure of the  
Constitution. Of course when I say this I should not be taken to  
suggest that effective alternative institutional mechanisms or  
arrangements for iudicial review cannot be made by Parliament. But  
what I wish to emphasise is that iudicial review is a vital principle of our  
Constitution and it cannot be abrogated without affecting the basic  
structure of the Constitution. If by a constitutional amendment the  
power of iudicial review is taken away and it is provided that the validity  
of any law made by the legislature shall not be liable to be called in  
Question on any ground even if it is outside the legislative competence  
of the legislature or is violative of any fundamental rights it would be  
149 
Page 149 
-(79kCip  
nothing shod of subversion of the Constitution for it would make a  
mockery of the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and  
the States and render the fundamental rights meaningless and futile, So 
also if a constitutional amendment is made which has the effect of 
taking away the power of judicial review and providing that no 
amendment made in the Constitution shall be liable to be questioned on 
any ground, even if such amendment is violative of the basic structure 
and, therefore, outside the amendatory power of Parliament, it would be 
making Parliament sole judge of the constitutional validity of what it has 
done and that would, in effect and substance, nullify the limitation on 
the amending power of Parliament and affect the basic structure of the 
Constitution. The conclusion must therefore inevitably follow that clause 
(4) of the Article 368 is unconstitutional and void as damaging the basic 
structure of the Constitution.' 
It is  undoubtedly fide that my iudgment in Minerva Mills Ltd. case (supra) was  
a minority iudgment but so far as this aspect is concerned the majority  
Judges also took the same view and held that iudicial review is a basic and  
essential feature of the Constitution and it cannot be abrogated without  
affecting the basic structure of the Constitution and it is equally clear from the  
same decision  that though judicial review cannot be altogether abrogated by  
Parliament by amending the Constitution in exercise of its constituent power  
Parliament can certainly without in any way violating the basic structure  
doctrine set up effective alternative institutional mechanisms or arrangements  
for iudicial review. The basic and essential feature of iudicial review cannot be  
cpensed with but it would be within the competence of Parliament to amend  
the Constitution so as to substitute in place of the High Court another  
alternative institutional mechanism or arrangement for judicial review  
provided it is no less efficacious than the High Court. Then, instead of the 
High Court, it would be another institutional mechanism or authority which 
would be exercising the power of judicial review with a view to enforcing the 
constitutional limitations and maintaining the rule of law. Therefore if any  
constitutional amendment made by Parliament takes away from the High  
Court the power of iudicial review in any particular area and vests it in any  
other institutional mechanism or authority it would not be violative of the basic  
structure doctrine so long as the essential condition is fulfilled namely that 
the alternative institutional mechanism or authority set UP by the parliamentary  
amendment is no less effective than the 1-liqh Court  
4. 	
Here, in the present case, the impugned Act has been enacted by 
Parliament in exercise of the power conferred by clause (1) of Article 323-A 
which was introduced in the Constitution by Constitution (42nd Amendment) 
Act, 1976. Clause (2)(d) of this article provides that a law made by Parliament 
under clause (1) may exclude the jurisdiction of courts, except the jurisdiction 
of the Supreme Court under Article 136. with respect to the disputes or 
complaints referred to in clause (1). The exclusion of the iurisdiction of the  
High Court under Articles 226 and 227 by any law made by Parliament under  
150 
Page 150 
clause (1) of Article 323-A is therefore specifically authorised by the  
constitutional amendment enacted in clause (2)(d) of that article. It is clear 
from the discussion in the preceding para that this constitutional amendment 
authorising exclusion of the jurisdiction of the High Court under Articles 226 
and 227 postulates for its validity that the law made under clause (1) of Article 
323-A excluding the jurisdiction of the High Court under Articles 226 and 227 
must provide for an effective alternative institutional mechanism or authority 
for judicial review. If this constitutional amendment were to permit a law made 
under clause (1) of Article 323-A to exclude the jurisdiction of the High Court 
under Articles 226 and 227 without setting up an effective alternative 
institukonal mechanism or arrangement for judicial review, it would be 
violative of the basic structure doctrine and hence outside the constituent 
power of Parliament. It must, therefore, be read as implicit in this 
constitutional amendment that the law excluding the jurisdiction of the High 
Court under Articles 226 and 227 permissible under it must not leave a void 
but it must set up another effective institutional mechanism or authority and 
vest the power of judicial review in it. Consequently, the impugned Act 
excluding the jurisdiction of the High Court under Articles 226 and 227 in 
respect of service matters and vesting such jurisdiction in the Administrative 
Tribunal can pass .the test of constitutionality as being within the ambit and 
coverage of clause (2)(d) of Article 323-A, only if it can be shown that the 
Administrative Tribunal set up under the impugned Act is equally efficacious 
as the High Court, so far as the power of judicial review over service matters 
is concerned. We must, therefore, address ourselves to the question whether 
the Administrative Tribunal established under the impugned Act can be 
regarded as equally effective and efficacious in exercising the power of 
judicial review as the High Court acting under Articles 226 and 227 of the 
Consfitufiond 
Extracts from the judgment rendered by Ranganath Misra, J. (as he then was) 
are first of all being reproduced hereunder:- 
"10. 	
In the writ applications as presented the main challenge was to 
abolition of the finisdiction of this Court under Article 32 in res ect of specified  
service disputes. Challenge was also raised against the tak ng away of the  
jurisdiction of the High Court under Articles 226 and 227 It was further  
canvassed that establishment of Benches of the Tribunal at Allahabad  
Bangalore Bombay Calcutta Gauhati Madras and Naapur with the principal  
seat at Delhi would still preiudice the parties whose cases were already  
pendino before the respective High Courts located at places other than these  
places and unless at the seat of every High Court facilities for presentation of 
applications and for hearing thereof were provided the parties and their  
lawyers would be adversely affected. The interim order made on October 31, 
1985, made provision to meet the working difficulties. Learned Attorney- 
151 
Page 151 
025A r 
General on behalf of the Central Government assured the court that early 
steps would be taken to amend the law so as to save the jurisdiction under 
Arncle 32, remove other minor anomalies and set up a Bench of the Tribunal 
at the seat of every High Court. By the Administrative Tribunals (Amendment) 
Ordinance, 1986, these amendments were brought about and by now an 
appropriate Act of Parliament has replaced the Ordinance Most of the original  
wounds of attack thus do not survive and the contentions that were  
canvassed at the hearing by the counsel appearing for different parties are  
these' 
(1) 	
Judicial review is a fundamental aspect of the basic structure of our  
Constitution and bar of the iurisdiction of the High Court under Articles 226  
and 227 as contained in Section 28 of the Act cannot be sustained' 
.(2) 	
Even if the bar of iurisdicton is upheld the Tribunal being a  
substitute of the High Court its constitution and set up should be such that  
it would in fad function as such substitute and become an institution in  
which the parties could repose faith and trust  
(3) 
Benches of the Tribunal should not only be established at the seat of 
every High Court but should be available at every place where the High 
Courts have permanent Benches; 
(4) 
So far as Tribunals set up or to be set up by the Central or the State 
Governments are concerned, they should have no jurisdiction in respect of 
employees of the Supreme Court or members of the subordinate judiciary 
and employees working in such establishments inasmuch as exercise of 
jurisdiction of the Tribunal would interfere with the control absolutely 
vested in the respective High Courts in regard to the judicial and other 
subordinate officers under Article 235 of the Constitution. 
11. 
After oral arguments were over, learned Attorney-General, after 
obtaining instructions from the Central Government filed a memorandum to 
the effect that Section 2(q) of the Act would be suitably amended so as to 
exclude officers and servants in the employment of the Supreme Court and 
members and staff of the subordinate judiciary from the purview of the Act. In 
the same memorandum it has also been said that Government would arrange 
for sittings of the Benches of the Tribunal at the seat or seats of each High 
Court on the basis that 'sittings' will include 'circuit sittings' and the details 
thereof would be worked out by the Chairman or the Vice-Chairman 
concerned. 
12. 
With these concessions made by the learned Attorney-General only  
two aspects remain to be dealt with by us namely those covered by the first  
and the second contentions. 
13. 
Strong reliance was placed on the judgment of Bhagwati, J. (one of us 
— presently the learned Chief Justice) in M'nerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of India, 
(1980) 3 SOC 625, where it was said: (SCC p. 678, pars 87) 
The Dower of iudicial review is an nteoral part of our constitutional  
system and without it there will be no government of laws and the rule  
of law would become a teasing illusion and a promise of unreality. I am  
152 
Page 152 
of the view that if there is one feature of our Constitution which more  
than any other is basic and fundamental to the maintenance of  
democracy and the rule of law it is the power of iudicial review and it is  
unquestionably to my mind part of the basic structure of the  
Constitution. Of course when I sa this I should not be taken to 
that effective alternative institutional mechanisms or arrangements for  
judicial review cannot be made by Parliament. But what I wish to  
emphasise is that udicial review is a vital principle of our Constitution  
and it cannot be a rogated without affecting the basic structure of the  
Constitution. If by a constitutional amendment, the power of judicial  
review is taken away and it is provided that the validity of any law made  
by the legislature shall not be liable to be called in question on any  
ground even if it is outside the legislative competence of the legislature  
or is violative of any fundamental rights it would be nothing short of  
subversion of the Constitution for it would make a mockery of the  
distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States and  
render the fundamental rights meaningless and futile. So also if a  
constitutional amendment is made which has the effect of taking away  
the power of judicial review..." 
14. 
Article 32 was described by Dr Ambedkar in course of the debate in 
the Constituent Assembly as the 'sour and 'heart' of the Constitution and it is 
in recognition of this position that though Article 323-A(2)(d) authorised 
exclusion of jurisdiction under Article 32 and the original Act had in Section 28 
provided for it, by amendment jurisdiction under Article 32 has been left 
untouched. The Act thus saves lurisdiction of this Court both under Article 32  
in respect of original proceedings as also under Article 136 for entertaining  
appeals against decisions of the Tribunal on grant of special leave. Judicial  
review by the Apex Court has thus been left intact  
15. 
The question that arises, however, for consideration is whether bar of 
jurisdiction under Articles 226 and 227 affects the provision for judicial review. 
The right to move the High Court in its writ jurisdiction — unlike the one under 
Article 32 — is not a fundamental right. Yet, the High Courts, as the working 
experience of three-and-a-half decades shows have in exercise of the power 
of judicial review played a definite and positive role in the matter of 
preservation of fundamental and other rights and in keeping administrative 
action under reasonable control. In these thirty-six years following the 
enforcement of the Constitution, not only has India's population been more 
than doubled but also the number of litigations before the courts including the 
High Courts has greatly increased. As the pendency in the High Courts 
increased and soon became the pressing problem of backlog, the nation's 
attention came to be bestowed on this aspect. Ways and means to relieve the 
High Courts of the load began to engage the attention of the government at 
the Centre as also in the various States. As early as 1969, a Committee was 
set up by the Central Government under the chairmanship of Mr Justice Shah 
of this Court to make recommendations suggesting ways and means for 
'53 
Page 153 
• • 
effective, expeditious and satisfactory disposal of matters relating to service 
disputes of government servants as it was found that a sizeable portion of 
pending litigations related to this category. The Committee recommended the 
setting up of an independent Tribunal to handle the pending cases before this 
Court and the High Courts. While this report was still engaging the attention of 
government, the Administrative Reforms Commission also took nate of the 
situation and recommended the setting up of Civil Services Tribunals to deal 
with appeals of Government servants against disciplinary action. In certain 
States, Tribunals of this type came into existence and started functioning. But 
the Central Government looked into the matter further as it transpired that the 
major chunk of service litigations related to matters other than disciplinary 
action. In May 1976, a Conference of Chief Secretaries of the States 
discussed this problem. Then came the Forty-second Amendment of the . 
Constitution bringing in Article 323-A which authorized Parliament to provide  
by law "for the adjudication or trial by Administrative Tribunals of disputes and  
complaints with respect to recruitment and conditions of service of persons  
appointed to public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the  
Union or of any State or of any local or other authority within the territory of  
India or under the control of the Government of India or of any Corporation  
owned or controlled by the government'. As already stated this article  
envisaged exclusion of the iurisdiction of all courts except the jurisdiction of  
the Supreme Court under Article 136 with respect to the disputes or 
complaints referred to in clause (1). Though the Constitution now contained 
the enabling power, no immediate steps were taken to set up any Tribunal as 
contemplated by Article 323-A. A Constitution Bench of this Court in K.K. 
Dutta v. Union of India, (1980) 4 SCC 38, observed: [SCC ff 39, para 1 : SCC 
(L & S) p.486] 
"There are few other litigative areas than disputes between members of 
various services inter se, where the principle that public policy requires 
that all litigation must have an end can apply with greater force. Public 
servants ought not to be driven or required to dissipate their time and 
energy in courtroom battles. Thereby their attention is diverted from 
public to private affairs and their inter se disputes affect their sense of 
oneness without which no institution can function effectively. The 
constitution of Service Tribunals by State Governments with an apex 
Tribunal at the Centre, which, in the generality of cases, should be the 
final arbiter of controversies relating to conditions of service, including 
the vexed question of seniority, may save the courts from the avalanche 
of writ petitions and appeals in service matters. The proceedings of 
such Tribunals can have the merit of informality and if they will not be 
fled down to strict rules of evidence, they might be able to produce 
solutions which will satisfy many..." 
In the meantime the problem of the backlog of cases in the High Courts 
became more acute and pressing and came to be further discussed in 
Parliament and in conferences and seminars. Ultimately in January 1985, 
161 
Page 159 
both Houses of Parliament passed the Bill and with the Presidential assent on 
February 27, 1985, the law enabling the long awaited Tribunal to be 
constituted came into existence. As already noticed, the Central Government 
notified the Act to come into force with effect from November 1, 1985. 
16. 
Exclusion of the jurisdiction of the High Courts in service matters 
and its propriety as also validity have thus to be examined in the background 
indicated above. We have already seen that judicial review by this Court is 
left wholly unaffected and thus there is a forum where matters of importance 
and grave injustice can be brought for determination or rectification. Thus  
exclusion of the iurisdiction of the High Court does not totally bar iudicial  
review. This Court in Minerva Mills' case (supra) did  •oint out t at "effective  
alternative institutional mechanisms or arrangements for iudicial review can  
be made by Parliament. Thus it is possible to set up an alternative institution  
in place of the High Court for providing judicial review. The debates and 
deliberations spread over almost two decades for exploring ways and 
means for relieving the High Courts of the load of backlog of cases and for 
assuring quick settlement of service disputes in the interest of the public 
servants as also the country cannot be lost sight of while considering this 
aspect. It has not been disputed before us - and perhaps could not have 
been - that the Tribunal under the scheme of the Act would take over a part  
of the existing backlog and a share of the normal load of the High Courts.  
The Tribunal has been contemplated as a substitute and not as  
supplemental to the Nigh Court in the scheme of administration of justice. To  
provide the Tribunal as an additional forum from where parties could qo to  
the High Court would certainly have been a retrograde step considering the  
situation and circumstances to meet which the innovation has been brought  
about. Thus barring of the jurisdiction of the High Court can indeed not be a  
valid ground of attack.  
17. 
What. however, has to be kept in view is that the Tribunal should  
be a real substitute of the High Court - not only in form and de jure but in  
content and de facto. As was pointed out in Minerva's Mills case (supra) the  
alternative arrangement has to be effective and efficient as also capable of 
upholding the constitutional limitations. Article 16 of the Constitution 
guarantees equality of opportunity in matters of public employment. 
Article 15 bars discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or 
place of birth. The touch-stone of equality enshrined in Article 14 is the 
greatest of guarantees for the citizen. Centering around these articles in the 
Constitution a service jurisprudence has already grown in this country. 
Under Sections 14 and 15 of the Act all the powers of the Courts except 
those of this Court in regard to matters specified therein vest in the Tribunal 
-- either Central or State. Thus the Tribunal is the substitute of the High 
Court and is entitled to exercise the powers thereof. 
18. 
The High Courts have been functioning over a century and a 
quarter and until the Federal Court was established under the Government 
of India Act, 1935, used to be the highest courts within their respective 
155 
Page 155 
jurisdictions subject to an appeal to the Privy Council in a limited category of 
cases, In this long period of about six scores of years, the High Courts have 
played their role effectively, efficiently as also satisfactorily. The litigant in  
this country has seasoned himself to look unto the High Court as the  
unfailing protector of his person. property and honour. The institution has  
served its purpose very well and the common man has thus come to repose  
great confidence therein Disciplined independent and trained Judges well  
versed in law and working with all openness in an unattached and obiecfive  
manner have ensured dispensation of iustice over the years. Aggrieved  
people approach the Court - the social mechanism to act as the arbiter -
not under legal obligation but under the belief and faith that justice shall be  
done to them and the State's authorities would implement the decision of the  
Court. It is. therefore, of paramount importance that the substitute institution  
- the Tribunal - must be a worthy successor of the High Court in all  
mapects That is exactly what this Court intended to convey when it woke of 
an alternative mechanism in Minerva Mills' case (supra): 
60. Reference may also be made to the decision rendered by this Court in L. 
Chandra Kumar v. Union of India, (1997) 3 SCC 261. The instant decision was 
rendered by a constitution bench of 7 Judges. The question which arose for 
determination in the instant judgment was, whether the power conferred upon the 
Parliament and the State legislatures vide Articles 323A(2)(d) and 32313(3)(d) 
totally excluding the jurisdiction of `all courts" except the Supreme Court, under 
Article 136 of the Constitution, violated the "basic structure" of the Constitution. 
In other words, the question was, whether annulling/retracting the power of 
"judicial review" conferred on High Courts (under Articles 226 and 227 of the 
Constitution) and on the Supreme Court (under Articles 32 of the Constitution), 
was violative of the 'basic structure" of the Constitution. Furthermore, whether 
the tribunals constituted under Articles 323A and 3238 of the Constitution, 
possess the competence to test the constitutional validity of statutory 
provisions/rules? And also, whether Tribunals constituted under Articles 323A 
156 
Page 156 
and 3238 of the Constitution could be said to be effective substitutes of the 
jurisdiction vested in the High Courts? And if not, what changes were required? 
The above controversy came to be referred to the constitution bench in 
furtherance of an order passed in L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India, (1995) 1 
SCC 400. on account of the decisions rendered in post S.P. Sampath Kumar 
cases (supra), namely, J.B. Chopra v. Union of India, (1987) 1 SCC 422, M.B. 
Majumdar v. Union of India, (1990) 4 SCC 501, Amulya Chandra Kalita v. Union 
of India, (1991) 1 SCC 181. R.K. Jain v. Union of India, (1993) 4 SCC 119, and 
Dr. Mahabal Ram v. Indian Council of Agricultural Research, (1994) 2 SCC 410. 
On the issues which are relevant to the present controversy, this Court observed 
as under:- 
"76. To express our opinion on the issue whether the power of judicial 
review vested in the High Courts and in the Supreme Court under Articles 
226/227 and 32 is part of the basic structure of the Constitution, we must 
first attempt to understand what constitutes the basic structure of the 
Constitution. The doctrine of basic structure was evolved in Kesavananda 
Bharati case,(1973) 4 SCC 225. However, as already mentioned that case 
did not lay down that the specific and particular features mentioned in that 
judgment alone would constitute the basic structure of our Constitution. 
Indeed, in the judgments of Shelat and Grover, JJ., Hegde and Mukherjea, 
JJ. and Jaganmohan Reddy, J., there are specific observations to the 
effect that their list of essential features comprising the basic structure of 
the Constitution are illustrative and are not intended to be exhaustive. In 
Indira Gandhi case, 1975 Supp. SCC 1, Chandrachud. J. held that the 
proper approach for a Judge who is confronted with the question whether a 
particular facet of the Constitution is part of the baslc structure, is to 
examine, in each individual case, the place of the particular feature in the 
scheme of our Constitution, its object and purpose, and the consequences 
of its denial on the integrity of our Constitution as a fundamental instrument 
for the governance of the country. (supra at pp. 751-752). This approach 
was specifically adopted by Bhagwati, J. in Minerva Mills case, (1980) 3 
SCC 625, (at pp. 671-672) and is not regarded as the definitive test in this 
field of Constitutional Law. 
157 
Page 157 
77. 
We find that the various factors mentioned in the test evolved by 
Chandrachud, J. have already been considered by decisions of various 
Benches of this Court that have been referred to in the course of our 
analysis. From their conclusions many of which have been extracted by us  
in tota. it appears that this Court has always considered the power of  
judicial review vested in the High Courts and in this Court under Articles  
flectively enablino legislative action to be subiected to the  
scrutiny of superior courts to be integral to our constitutional scheme. 
While several judgments have made specific references to this aspect 
[Gajendragadkar, C.J. in Keshav Singh case, AIR 1965 SC 745, Beg, J. 
and Khanna. J. in Kesavananda Bharati case (supra), Chandrachud, C.J. 
and Bhagwati, J. in Minerva Mills (supra), Chandrachud, C.J. in Fertilizer 
Kemper, (1981) 1 SCC 568, K.N. Singh, J. in Delhi Judicial Service Assn., 
(1991) 4 SCC 406] the rest have made general observations highlighting  
the significance of this feature. 
78. 
The legitimacy of the power of courts within constitutional  
democracies to review legislative action has been questioned since the  
time it was first conceived. The Constitution of India being alive to such  
criticism has while conferring such power upon the higher judiciary  
incorporated important safeguards. An analysis of the manner in which the  
Framers of our Constitution incorporated provisions relating to the iudiciary  
would indicate that they were very greatly concerned with securing the  
independence of the iudiciarv. These attempts were directed at ensuring  
that the judiciary would be capable of effectively discharging its wide  
powers of judicial review. While the Constitution confers the power to strike  
down laws upon the High Courts and the Supreme Court. it also contains  
elaborate provisions dealing with the tenure salaries allowances  
ref 	
nt age of Judges as well as the mechanism for selecting Judges to  
the superior courts. The inclusion of such elaborate provisions appears to  
have been occasioned by the belief that. armed by such provisions the  
superior courts would be insulated from any executive or legislative  
alpts to interfere with the making of their decisions The Judges of the 
superior courts have been entrusted with the task of upholding the 
Constitution and to this end, have been conferred the power to interpret it. 
It is they who have to ensure that the balance of power envisaged by the 
Constitution is maintained and that the legislature and the executive do 
not, in the discharge of their functions, transgress constitutional limitations. 
It is equally their duty to oversee that the judicial decisions rendered by 
those who man the subordinate courts and tribunals do not fall foul of strict 
standards of legal correctness and judicial independence. The 
constitutional safeguards which ensure the independence of the Judges of 
the superior judiciary, are not available to the Judges of the subordinate 
judiciary or to those who man tribunals created by ordinary legislations. 
Consequently, Judges of the latter category can never be considered full 
and effective substitutes for the superior judiciary in discharging the 
158 
Page 153 
 
--A59 
A59 -- 
function of constitutional interpretation. We therefore hold that the power  
of iudicial review over le  islative action vested in the Hi.h Courts under 
Article 226 and in this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution is an  
integral and essential feature of the Constitution constituting part of its  
basic structure. Ordinarily therefore the power of High Courts and the  
Supreme Court to test the constitutional validity of legislations can never  
be ousted or excluded.  
79. We also hold that the power vested in the Hi.h Courts to exercise  
itic 
jStiperintendence over the decisions of all courts and tribunals  
within their respective lurisdictions is also part of the basic structure of the  
Constitution. This is because a situation where the High Courts are  
divested of all other judicial functions apart from that of constitutional  
interpretation is equally to be avoided.

96. It has been brought to our notice that one reason why these  
Tribunals have been functioning inefficiently is because there is no  
authority charged with supervising and fulfilling their administrative  
requirements. To this end, it is suggested that the Tribunals be made 
subject to the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Courts within whose 
territorial jurisdiction they fall. We are, however, of the view that this may 
not be the best way of solving the problem. We do not think that our 
constitutional scheme requires that all adjudicatory bodies which fall within 
the territorial jurisdiction of the High Courts should be subject to their 
supervisory jurisdiction. If the idea is to divest the High Courts of their 
onerous burdens, then adding to their supervisory functions cannot, in any 
manner, be of assistance to them. The situation at present is that different  
Tribunals constituted under different enactments are administered by  
different administrative departments of the Central and the State  
Governments. The problem is compounded by the fact that some Tribunals 
have been created pursuant to Central Legislations and some others have 
been created by State Legislations. However even in the case of Tribunals  
created by parliamentary legislations there is no uniformity in  
administration. We are of the view that. until a wholly independent agency  
for the administration of all such Tribunals can be set up it is desirable that  
all such Tribunals should be as far as possible under a single nodal 
ministry which will be in a position to oversee the working of these  
Tribunals. For a number of reasons that Ministry should appropriately be  
the Ministry of Law_ It would be open for the Ministry, in its turn, to appoint 
an independent supervisory body to oversee the working of the Tribunals. 
This will ensure that if the President or Chairperson of the Tribunal is for 
some reason unable to take sufficient interest in the working of the 
Tribunal, the entire system will not languish and the ultimate consumer of 
justice will not suffer. The creation of a single umbrella organisation will in  
our view remove many of the ills of the present system If the need arises.  
there can be separate umbrella organisations at the Central and the State  
159 
Page 159 
6,0  
levels. Such a supervisory authority must try to ensure that the  
incSendence of the members of all such Tribunals is maintained. To that  
extud the
,procedure for the selection of the members of the Tribunals the  
manner in which funds are allocated for the functioning of the Tribunals  
and all other consequential details will have to be clearly spelt out.  
97. 
The suggestions that we have made in respect of appointments to  
Tribunals and the supervision of their administrative function need to be  
considered in detail by those entrusted with the duty of formulating the  
policy in this respect. That body will also have to take into consideration 
the comments of expert bodies like the LCI and the Malimath Committee in 
this regard. We therefore recommend that the Union of India initiate  
action in this behalf and after consulting all concerned place all these  
Tribunals under one single nodal department preferably the Legal  
Department.  
98. 
Since we have analysed the issue of the constitutional validity of 
Section 5(6) of the Act at length, we may now pronounce our opinion on 
this aspect. Though the vires of the provision was not in question in Dr 
Mahabal Ram case, (1994) 2 SCC 401, we believe that the approach 
adopted in that case, the relevant portion of which has been extracted in 
the first part of this judgment, is correct since it harmoniously resolves the 
manner in which Sections 5(2) and 5(6) can operate together. We wish to  
make it clear that where a question involving the interpretation of a  
statutory provision or rule in relation to the Constitution arises for the  
consideration of a Single Member Bench of the Administrative Tribunal the  
proviso to Section 5(6) will automatically apply and the Chairman or the  
Member concerned shall refer the matter to a Bench consisting of at least  
two Members one of whom must be a Judicial Member. This will ensure  
that questions involving the vires of a statutory provision or rule will never  
arise for adiudication before a Single Member Bench or a Bench which  
does not consist of a Judicial Member. So construed, Section 5(6) will no 
longer be susceptible to charges of unconstitutionality. 
99. 
In view of the reasoning adopted by us we hold that clause 2(d) of  
Article 323-A and clause 3(d) of Article 323-B to the extent they exclude  
the iurisdiction of the High Courts and the Supreme Court under Articles  
226/227 and 32 of the Constitution are unconstitutional. Section 28 of the  
Act and the "exclusion of ludsdicfion1  clauses in all other legislations  
enacted under the aegis of Articles 323-A and 323-B would to the same  
extent be unconstitutional. The iurisdiction conferred upon the High Courts  
under Articles 226/227 and upon the Supreme Court under Article 32 of  
the Constitution is a part of the inviolable basic structure of our  
Constitution. While this iurisdiction cannot be ousted other courts and  
Tribunals may perform a supplemental role in discharging the powers  
conferred by Articles 226/227 and 32 of the Constitution. The Tribunals 
created under Article 323-A and Article 323-B of the Constitution are 
possessed of the competence to test the constitutional validity of statutory 
160 
Page 160 
provisions and rules. All decisions of these Tribunals will however. be   
subject to scrutiny before a Division Bench of the Fliah Court within whose  
jurisdiction the Tribunal concerned falls The Tribunals will nevertheless  
continue to act like courts of first instance in respect of the areas of law for  
which they have been constituted. It will not therefore be open for litigants  
to directly approach the High Courts even in cases where they question  
the vires of statutory legislations (except where the legislation which  
creates the particular Tribunal is challenged) by overlooking the jurisdiction  
of the Tribunal concerned. Section 5(6) of the Act is valid and constitutional  
and is to be interpreted in the manner we have indicated." 
61. Reference was then made to Union of India v. Madras Bar Association, 
(2010) 11 SCC 1. The instant decision was rendered by a constitution bench of 
5 Judges. The controversy adjudicated upon in this case related to a challenge 
to the constitutional validity of Parts 1B and 1C of the Companies Act, 1956. 
These parts were inserted into the Companies Act, by the Companies (Second 
Amendment) Act, 2002. Thereby, provision was made for the constitution of the 
National Company Law Tribunal and the National Company Law Appellate 
Tribunal. The relevant questions raised in the present controversy, are being 
noticed. Firstly, whether Parliament does not have the jurisdiction/legislative 
competence, to vest intrinsic judicial functions, that have been traditionally 
performed by High Courts, in any tribunal outside the judiciary? Secondly, 
whether transferring of the entire company law jurisdiction, hitherto before vested 
in High Courts, to the National Company Law Tribunal, which was not under the 
control of the judiciary, was violative of the principles of 'separation of powers° 
and "independence of judiciary? Thirdly, whether Sections 10-FB, 10-FD, 10-
FE, 10-FF, 10-FL(2), 10-FO, 10-FR(3), 10-FT, 10-FX contained in Parts I-B and 
I-C of the Companies Act, by virtue of the above amendment, were 
unconstitutional being in breach of the principles of the "rule of law", "separation 
161 
Page 161 
AtA 
of powers" and "independence of judiciary"? The relevant narration and 
conclusions recorded by this Court are being reproduced hereunder:- 
"Section 10-FD(3)(f): Appointment of Technical Member to NCLT  
16. 
The High Court has held that appointment of a member under the 
category specified in Section 10-F0(3)(f), can have a role only in matters 
concerning revival and rehabilitation of sick industrial companies and not in 
relation to other matters. The High Court has therefore virtually indicated 
that NCLT should have two divisions, that is an Adjudication Division and a 
Rehabilitation Division and persons selected under the category specified 
in clause (f) should only be appointed as Members of the Rehabilitation 
Division. 
17. 
The Union Government contends that similar provision exists in 
Section 4(3) of the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 
1985; that the provision is only an enabling one so that the best talent can 
be selected by the Selection Committee headed by the Chief Justice of 
India or his nominee; and that it may not be advisable to have division or 
limit or place restrictions on the power of the President of the Tribunal to 
constitute appropriate benches. It is also pointed out that a technical 
member would always sit in a Bench with a judicial member. 
Section 10-FD(3)(q)-  Qualification for appointment of Technical Member 
18. 
The High Court has observed that in regard to the Presiding Officers 
of the Labour Courts and the Industrial Tribunals or the National Industrial 
Tribunal, a minimum period of three to five years' experience should be 
prescribed, as what is sought to be utilised is their expert knowledge in 
labour laws. 
19. 
The Union Government submits that it may be advisable to leave the 
choice of selection of the most appropriate candidate to the Committee 
headed by the Chief Justice of India or his nominee. 
20. 
The High Court has also observed that as persons who satisfy the 
qualifications prescribed in Section 10-FD(3)(g) would be persons who fall 
under Section 10-FD(2)(a), it would be more appropriate to include this 
qualification in Section 10-FD(2)(a). It has also observed in Section 10-FL 
dealing with ''Benches of the Tribunal", a provision should be made that a 
"judicial member" with this qualification shall be a member of the Special 
Bench referred to in Section 10-FL(2) for cases relating to rehabilitation, 
restructuring or winding up of companies. 
21. 
The Union Government has not accepted these findings and 
contends that the observations of the High Court would amount to judicial 
legislation. 
Section 10-FD(3)(h): Qualification of Technical Member of NCLT  
22. 
The High Court has observed that clause (h) referring to the 
category of persons having special knowledge of and experience in 
matters relating to labour, for not less than 15 years is vague and should 
162 
Page 162 
be suitably amended so as to spell out with certainty the qualification which 
a person to be appointed under clause (h) should possess. 
23. 
The Union Government contends that in view of the wide and varied 
experience possible in labour matters, it may not be advisable to set out 
the nature of experience or impose any restrictions in regard to the nature 
of experience. It is submitted that the Selection Committee headed by the 
Chief Justice of India or his nominee would consider each application on 
its own merits. 
24. 
The second observation of the High Court is that the member 
selected under the category mentioned in clause (it) must confine his 
participation only to the Benches dealing with revival and rehabilitation of 
sick companies and should also be excluded from functioning as a single-
Member Bench for any matter. 
25. 
The Union Government contends that it may not be advisable to 
fetter the prerogative of the President of the Tribunal to constitute benches 
by making use of available members. It is also pointed out that it may not 
be proper to presume that a person well versed in labour matters will be 
unsuitable to be associated with a judicial member in regard to 
adjudication of winding-up matters.

Section 10-FX: Selection process for President/Chairperson 
31. 
The High Court has expressed the view that the selection of the 
President/Chairperson should be by a Committee headed by the Chief 
Justice of India in consultation with two senior Judges of the Supreme 
Court. 
32. 
The Union Government has submitted that it would not be advisable 
to make such a provision in regard to appointment of the 
President/Chairperson of statutory tribunals. It is pointed out that no other 
legislation constituting tribunals has such a provision." 
In order to assail the challenge to the provisions extracted hereinabove, the 
Union of India asserted, that the Madras High Court (the judgment whereof was, 
also under challenge) having held that the Parliament had the competence and 
the power to establish the National Company Law Tribunal and the National 
Company Law Appellate Tribunal, ought to have dismissed the writ petition. The 
assertion at the hands of the Union of India was, that some of the directions 
contained in the judgment rendered by the Madras High Court, reframed and 
recast Parts 1E1 and 1C introduced by the Amendment Act and amounted to 
163 
Page 163 
converting judicial review" into judicial legislation. It was, however noticed, that 
the Union of India having agreed to rectify several of the defects pointed out by 
the High Court, the appeal of the Union of India was restricted to the findings of 
the High Court relating to Sections 10-FD(3)(0, (g);  (h) and 10-FX. To 
understand the tenor of the issue which was the subject matter before this Court. 
it is relevant to extract some of the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 as 
amended by the Companies (Second Amendment) Act, 2002, relating to the 
constitution of the National Company Law Tribunal and the National Company 
Law Appellate Tribunal). The same are reproduced hereunder:-

Having noticed the relevant statutory provisions, this Court made detailed 
observations relating to "difference between Courts and Tribunals', "Re: 
independence of judiciary", 'separation of powers'', and "whether the 
Government can transfer judicial functions traditionally performed by Courts, to 
Tribunals", as under:-

70. 
But in India unfortunately tribunals have not achieved full  
Independence The Secretary of the ''sponsorinq department" concerned  
sits in the Selection Committee for appointment. When the tribunals are  
formed they are mostly dependent on their sponsoring department for  
funding infrastructure and even space for functioning. The statutes  
constituting tribunals routinely_ provide for members of civil services from  
1ponsoring departments becoming members of the tribunal and  
continuing their lien with their parent cadre. Unless wide rewind reforms  
as were implemented in United Kingdom and as were suggested by  L 
Chandra Kumar vs. Union of India (1997) 3 SCC 261. are brought about  
tribunals in India will not be considered as independent 
Whether the Government can transfer the judicial functions traditionally 
performed by courts to tribunals? 
71. 
It is well settled that courts perform all judicial functions of the State 
except those that are excluded by law from their jurisdiction. Section 9 of 
the Code of Civil Procedure, for example, provides that the courts shall 
have jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature excepting suits of which 
their cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred. 
72. 
Article 32 provides that without prejudice to the powers conferred on 
the Supreme Court by clauses (1) and (2) of the said Article, Parliament 
may by law, empower any other court to exercise within the local limits of 
its jurisdiction all or any of the powers exercisable by the Supreme Court 
under clause (2) of Article 32. 
73. 
Article 247 provides that notwithstanding anything contained in 
Chapter I of Part XI of the Constitution, Parliament may by law provide for 
the establishment of any additional courts for the better administration of 
laws made by Parliament or of any existing laws with respect to a matter 
enumerated in the Union List. Article 245 provides that subject to the 
provisions of the Constitution, Parliament may make laws for the whole or 
any part of the territory of India, and the legislature of a State may make 
laws for the whole or any part of the State. 
74. 
Article 246 deals with the subject-matter of laws made by Parliament 
and by the legislatures of States. The Union List (List I of the Seventh 
Schedule) enumerates the matters with respect to which Parliament has 
exclusive powers to make laws. Entry 77 of List I refers to constitution, 
organisation. jurisdiction and powers of the Supreme Court. Entry 78 of 
List I refers to constitution and organisation of the High Courts. Entry 79 of 
List I refers to extension or exclusion of the jurisdiction of a High Court, to 
or from any Union Territory. Entry 43 of List I refers to incorporation, 
regulation and winding up of trading corporations and Entry 44 of List I 
refers to incorporation, regulation and winding up of corporations. Entry 95 
of List I refers to jurisdiction and powers of all courts except the Supreme 
Court, with respect to any of the matters in the Union List. 
75. 
The Concurrent List (List III of the Seventh Schedule) enumerates 
the matters with respect to which Parliament and the Legislature of a State 
170 
Page 170 
- A? 
will have concurrent power to make laws. Entry 11-A of List III refers to 
administration of justice, constitution and organization of all courts except 
the Supreme Court and the High Courts. Entry 46 of List III refers to 
jurisdiction and powers of all courts, except the Supreme Court, with 
respect to any of the matters in List III. 
76. 	
Part XIV-A was inserted in the Constitution with effect from 3-1-1977 
by the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976. The said part 
contains two articles. Article 323-A relates to Administrative Tribunals and 
empowers Parliament to make a law, providing for the adjudication or trial 
by Administrative Tribunals of disputes and complaints with respect to 
recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to public 
services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Government or of 
any State or of any local or other authority within the territory of India or 
under the control of the Government of India or of any corporation owned 
or controlled by the Government.

80. The legislative competence of Parliament to provide for creation of 
courts and tribunals can be traced to Entries 77, 78, 79 and Entries 43. 44 
read with Entry 95 of List I, Entry 11-A read with Entry 46 of List III of the 
Seventh Schedule. Referring to these articles, this Court in two cases, 
namely, Union of India v. Delhi High Court Bar Assn., (2002) 4 SCC 75, 
and State of Karnataka v. Vishwabharathi House Building Coop. Society, 
(2003) 2 SCC 412, held that Articles 323-A and 323-B are enabling 
provisions which enable the setting up of tribunals contemplated therein: 
and that the said articles, however, cannot be interpreted to mean that they 
prohibited the legislature from establishing tribunals not covered by those 
articles, as long as there is legislative competence under the appropriate 
entry in the Seventh Schedule. 
xxx 	
xxx 	
xxx 
90. But when we sa that the legislature has the competence to make  
laws 	
ovidina which disputes will be decided by courts and which  
thyputes will be decided by tribunals it is subiect to constitutional  
limitations wi hout encroaching upon the independence of the iudiciary  
and keeping in view the principles of the rule of law and separation of  
powers. If tribunals are to be vested with ludicial power hitherto vested in  
or exercised by courts such tribunals should possess the independence  
security and capacity associated with courts. If the tribunals are intended  
to serve an area which requires specialised knowledge or expertise no  
doubt there can be technical members in addition to iudicial members.  
Where however iurisdiction to try certain cateoory of cases are transferred  
from courts to tribunals only to expedite the hearing and disposal or relieve  
from the rigours of the Evidence Act and procedural laws there is  
obviously no need to have any non-judicial technical member. In respect of  
such tribunals only members of the iudiciary should be the Presiding  
Officers/Members. Typical examples of such special tribunals are Rent  
171 
Page 171 
Tribunals Motor Accidents Claims Tribunals and Special Courts under  
several enactrrents. Therefore when transferring the jurisdiction exercised  
by courts to tribunals. which does not involve any specialised knowledge or  
expertise in any field and expediting the disposal and relaxing the  
procedure is the only obiect a provision for technical members in addition  
to  or in substitution of iudicial members would clearly be a case of dilution  
of and encroachment upon the independence of the judiciary and the rule  
of law and would be unconstitutional.  
91 	
In R K. Jain v. Union of India, (1993) 4 SCC 119, this Court 
observed: 	169-70, pare 67) 
"67. The tribunals set up under Articles 323-A and 323-B of the 
Consfitudon or under an Act of legislature are creatures of the 
statute and in no case claim the status as Judges of the High Court 
or parity or as substitutes. However. the personnel appointed to hold  
those offices under the State are called upon to discharge judicial or  
quasi-judicial powers. So they must have judicial approach and also  
knowledge and expertise in that particular branch of constitutional  
administrative and tax laws. The legal input would undeniably be  
more important and sacrificing the legal .input and not giving it  
sufficient we ghiage and teeth would definitely impair the efficacy  
and effectiveness of the judicial adiudication It is therefore  
necessary that those who adjudicate upon these matters should  
have le al expertise, judicial experience and modicum of legal  
training as on many an occasion different and complex questions of  
law which baffle the minds of even trained Judges in the High Court  
and Supreme Court would arise fo discussion and decision.  
92. 
Having held that legislation can ransfer certain areas of litigation 
from courts to tribunals and recognising hat the legislature can provide for 
technical members in addition to judicial members in such tribunals, let us 
turn our attention to the question as to who can be the members. 
93. 
If the Act provides for a tribunal with a judicial member and a  
technical member does it mean that there are no limitations upon the  
power of the legislature to prescribe the qualifications for such technical  
member? The question will also be whether any limitations can be read 
into the competence of the legislature to prescribe the qualification for the 
judicial member? The answer, of course, depends upon the nature of 
jurisdiction that is being transferred from the courts to tribunals. Ifigjly_ 
and necessarily. depending upon whether the jurisdiction is being shifted  
711  h Court or a District Court or a Civil Judge the yardstick will  
differ It is for the court which considers the challenge to the qualification  
to determine whether the legislative power has been exercised in a  
manner in consonance with the constitutional principles and constitutional  
guarantees.

- 
101. Independent judicial tribunals for determination of the rights of  
citizens and for adjudication of the disputes and complaints of the citizens  
is a necessary concomitant of the rule of law. The rule of law has several  
facets one of which is that disputes of citizens 	
be decided  b Judges 
 
who are independent and impartial' and that disputes as to legality of acts  
of the Government will be decided by Judges who are independent of the  
executive. Another facet of the rule of law is equality before law. The 
essence of the equality is that it must be capable of being enforced and 
adjudicated by an independent judicial forum. Judicial independence and  
separation of iudicial power from the executive are part of the common law  
traditions implicit in a Constitution like ours which is based on the  
Westminster model.  
102. The fundamental right to equality before law and equal protection of  
laws guaranteed by Article 14 of the Constitution clearly includes a right to  
have the person's rights adiudicated by a forum which exercises judicial  
power in an impartial and independent manner consistent with the  
recognised principles of adiudication. Therefore wherever access to courts 
to enforce such rights is sought to be abridged, altered. modified or 
substituted by directing him to approach an alternative forum, such 
legislative Act is open to challenge if 't violates the right to adjudication by 
an independent forum. Therefore, though the challenge by MBA is on the 
ground of violation of principles forming part of the basic structure, they are 
relatable to one or more of the express provisions of the Constitution which 
gave rise to such principles. Though the validity of the provisions of a 
legislative Act cannot be challenged on the ground it violates the basic 
structure of the Constitution, it can be challenged as violative of 
constitutional provisions which enshrine the principles of the rule of law, 
separation of powers and independence of the judiciary. 
xxx 	
xxx 	
xxx 
108. We may summarise the position as follows: 
(a) A legislature can enact a law transferring the jurisdiction exercised  
by courts in regard to any specified subject (other than those which are  
vested in courts by express provisions of the Constitution) to any  
tribunal. 
(b) All courts are tribunals. Any tribunal to which any existing iurisdiction  
of courts is transferred should also be a judicial tribunal. This means  
th.t such tribunal should have as members, persons of a rank. capacity  
and status as nearly as possible equal to the rank status and capacity  
of the court which was till then dealing with such matters and the  
members of the tribunal should have the independence and security of  
tenure associated with judicial tribunals. 
(o) Whenever there is need for 'tribunals" there is no presumption that  
there should be technical members in the tribunals. When any_ 
Bi 
Sfion is shifted from courts to tribunals, on the ground of  
pendency and delay in courts and the iurisdiction so transferred does  
173 
Page 173 
not involve any technical aspects requiring the assistance of experts  
the tribunals should normally have only iudicial members. Only where  
the exercise of jurisdiction involves inquiry and decisions into technical  
or special aspects. where presence of technical members will be useful  
and necessary tribunals should have technical members.  
Indiscriminate appointment of technical members in all tribunals will  
dilute and adversely affect the independence of the judiciary. 
(d) The legislature can reorganise the iurisdiotions of judicial tribunals.  
For example it can provide that a specified category of cases tried by a  
!Sher cowl can be tried by a lower court or vice versa (a standard  
example 
le is the variation of pecuniary limits of the courts). Similarly while  
constitutin tribunals. the legislature can •rescribe the 
Qualifications/eligibility criteria. The same is however subject to judicial  
review. If the court in exercise of judicial review is of the view that such  
tribunalisation would adversely affect the independence of the iudiciary  
or the standards of the judiciary the court may interfere to preserve the  
independence and standards of the judiciary. Such an exercise will be  
part of the checks and balances measures to maintain the separation of  
powers and to prevent any encroachment intentional or unintentional  
by either the legislature or by the executive.

113. When the Administrative Tribunals were constituted the presence of  
members of civil services as Technical (Administrative) Members was  
considered necessary as they were well versed in the functioning of  
overnment de artments and the rules and •rocedures a.•licable to 
government servants. But the fact that senior officers of civil services could  
function as Administrative Members of the Administrative Tribunals does  
not necessarily make them suitable to function as technical members in  
the 	
Wany Law Tribunals or other tribunals requiring technical  
expertise. The tribunals cannot become providers of sinecure to members  
of civil services by appointing them as technical members. though they  
may not have technical expertise in the field to which the tribunals relate  
or worse where purely judicial functions are involved. While one can  
understand the presence of the members of the civil services being  
technical members in Administrative Tribunals or Military Officers being  
members of the Armed Forces Tribunals or electrical engineers being  
members of the Electricity Appellate Tribunal or telecom engineers being  
members of TDSAT we find no logic in members of the general civil  
services being members of the Company Law Tribunals_ 
114. Let us now refer to the dilution of independence. If any member of  
the tribunal is permitted to retain his lien over his post with the parent  
cadre or ministry or department in the civil service for his entire period of  
service as member of the tribunal he would continue to think act and  
function as a member of the civil services. A litigant may legitimately think  
that such a member will not be independent and impartial. We reiterate  
174 
Page 174 
that our observations are not intended to cast any doubt about the honesty  
and integrity or capacity and capability of the officers of civil services in  
particular those who are of the rank of Joint Secretary or for that matter  
even junior officers. What we are referring to is the perception of the  
litigants and the public about the independence or conduct of the members  
of the tribunal. Independence. impartiality and fairness are Qualifies which  
have to be nurtured and develo ed and cannot be ac•uired overni ht. The 
independence of members discharging ludicial functions in a tribunal  
cannot be diluted.

120. We may tabulate the corrections required to set right the defects in  
Parts I-B and I-C of the Act: 
(i) Only Judges and advocates can be considered for appointment as 
judicial members of the Tribunal. Only High Court Judges, or Judges 
who have served in the rank of a District Judge for at least five years or 
a person who has practised as a lawyer for ten years can be 
considered for appointment as a judicial member. Persons who have 
held a Group A or equivalent post under the Central or State 
Government with experience in the Indian Company Law Service (Legal 
Branch) and the Indian Legal Service (Grade I) cannot be considered 
for appointment as judicial members as provided in sub-sections (2)(c) 
and (d) of Section 10-FD. The expertise in Company Law Service or the 
Indian Legal Service will at best enable them to be considered for 
appointment as technical members. 
(ii) As NCLT takes over the functions of the High Court, the members 
should as nearly as possible have the same position and status as High 
Court Judges. This can be achieved, not by giving the salary and perks 
of a High Court Judge to the members, but by ensuring that persons 
who are as nearly equal in rank, experience or competence to High 
Court Judges are appointed as members. Therefore, only officers who 
are holding the ranks of Secretaries or Additional Secretaries alone can 
be considered for appointrhent as technical members of the National 
Company Law Tribunal. Clauses (c) and (d) of sub-section (2) and 
clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (3) of Section 10-FD which provide 
for persons with 15 years experience in Group A post or persons 
holding the post of Joint Secretary or equivalent post in the Central or 
the State Government, being qualified for appointment as Members of 
Tribunal, are invalid. 
(ik A 'technical member presupposes an experience in the field to 
which the Tribunal relates. A member of the Indian Company Law 
Service who has worked with Accounts Branch or officers in other 
departments who might have incidentally dealt with some aspect of 
company law cannot be considered as "experts" qualified to be 
appointed as technical members. Therefore clauses (a) and (b) of sub-
section (3) are not valid. 
175 
Page 175 
(iv) The first part of clause (f) of sub-section (3) providing that any 
person having special knowledge or professional experience of 20 
years in science, technology, economics, banking, industry could be 
considered to be persons with expertise in company law, for being 
appointed as technical members in the Company Law Tribunal, is 
invalid. 
(v) Persons having ability, integrity, standing and special knowledge 
and professional experience of not less than fifteen years in industrial 
finance, industrial management, industrial reconstruction, investment 
and accountancy, may however be considered as persons having 
expertise in .rehabilitation/revival of companies and therefore, eligible 
for being considered for appointment as technical members. 
(vi) In regard to category of persons referred in clause (g) of sub-
section (3) at least five years' experience should be specified. 
(vii) Only clauses (c), (d). (e), (g), (h), and the latter part of clause (t) in 
sub-section (3) of Section 10-FD and officers of civil services of the 
rank of the Secretary or Additional Secretary in the Indian Company 
Law Service and the Indian Legal Service can be considered for 
purposes of appointment as technical members of the Tribunal. 
(viii) Instead of a five-member Selection Committee with the Chief 
Justice of India (or his nominee) as Chairperson and two Secretaries 
from the Ministry of Finance and Company Affairs and the Secretary in 
the Ministry of Labour and the Secretary in the Ministry of Law and 
Justice as members mentioned in Section 10-FX, the Selection 
Committee should broadly be on the following lines: 
(a) Chief Justice of India or his nominee—Chairperson (with a 
casting vote); 
(b) A Senior Judge of the Supreme Court or Chief Justice of High 
Court—Member; 
(c) Secretary in the Ministry of Finance and Company Affairs— 
Member; and 
(d) Secretary in the Ministry of Law and Justice—Member. 
(ix) The term of office of three years shall be changed to a term of 
seven or five years subject to eligibility for appointment for one more 
term. This is because considerable time is required to achieve expertise 
in the field concerned. A term of three years is very short and by the 
time the members achieve the required knowledge, expertise and 
efficiency. one term will be over. Further the said term of three years 
with the retirement age of 65 years is perceived as having been tailor-
made for persons who have retired or shortly to retire and encourages 
these Tribunals to be treated as post-retirement havens. If these 
Tribunals are to function effectively and efficiently they should be able 
to attract younger members who will have a reasonable period of 
service. 
176 
Page 176 
.-- 7 7 
(x) The second proviso to Section 10-FE enabling the President and 
members to retain lien with their parent cadre/ministry/department while 
holding office as President or Members will not be conducive for the 
independence of members. Any person appointed as member should 
be prepared to totally disassociate himself from the executive. The lien 
cannot therefore exceed a period of one year. 
(xi) To maintain independence and security in service, sub-section (3) 
of Section 10-FJ and Section 10-FV should provide that suspension of 
the President/Chairman or member of a Tribunal can be only with the 
concurrence of the Chief Justice of India. 
(xii) The administrative support for all Tribunals should be from the 
Ministry of Law and Justice. Neither the Tribunals nor their members 
shall seek or be provided with facilities from the respective sponsoring 
or parent Ministries or Department concerned. 
Cato Two-member Benches of the Tribunal should always have a 
judicial member. Whenever any larger or special Benches are 
constituted, the number of technical members shall not exceed the 
judicial members." 
62. Before venturing to examine the controversy in hand it needs to be 
noticed, that some of the assertions raised at the hands of the petitioners in the 
present controversy have since been resolved. These have been noticed in an 
order passed by this Court in Madras Bar Association v. Union of India. (2010) 11 
SCC 67, which is being extracted hereunder:- 
"1. 	
In all these petitions, the constitutional validity of the National Tax 
Tribunal Act, 2005 the Act", for short) is challenged. In TC No. 150 of 
2006, additionally there is a challenge to Section 46 of the Constitution 
(Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 and Article 323-B of the Constitution 
of India. It is contended that Section 46 of the Constitution (Forty-second 
Amendment) Act, is ultra vires the basic structure of the Constitution as it 
enables proliferation of the tribunal system and makes serious inroads into 
the independence of the judiciary by providing a parallel system of 
administration of justice, in which the executive has retained extensive 
control over matters such as appointment, jurisdiction, procedure, etc. It is 
contended that Article 323-B violates the basic structure of the Constitution 
as it completely takes away the jurisdiction of the High Courts and vests 
them in the National Tax Tribunal, including trial of offences and 
adjudication of pure questions of law, which have always been in the 
exclusive domain of the judiciary. 
177 
Page 177 
2. 
When these matters came up on 9-1-2007 before a three-Judge 
Bench, the challenge to various sections of the Act was noticed. 
3. 
The first challenge was to Section 13 which permitted "any person" 
duly authorised to appear before the National Tax Tribunal. The Union of 
India submitted that the appropriate amendment will be made in the Act to 
ensure that only lawyers, chartered accountants and parties in person will 
be permitted to appear before the National Tax Tribunal. 
4. The second challenge was to Section 5(5) of the Act which provided 
that: 
"5. (5) The Central Government may in consultation with the 
Chairperson transfer a member from headquarters of one Bench in 
one State to the headquarters of another Bench in another State or 
to the headquarters of any other Bench within a State:" 
5. The Union of India submitted that having regard to the nature of the 
functions to be performed by the Tribunal and the constitutional scheme of 
separation of powers and independence of judiciary, the expression 
"consultation with the Chairperson' occurring in Section 5(5) of the Act 
should be read and construed as "concurrence of the Chairperson'. 
6. The third challenge was to Section 7 which provided for a Selection 
Committee comprising of (a) the Chief Justice of India or a Judge of the 
Supreme Court nominated by him, (b) Secretary in the Ministry of Law and 
Justice, and (c) Secretary in the Ministry of Finance. It was contended by 
the petitioners that two of the members who are Secretaries to the 
Government forming the majority may override the opinion of the Chief 
Justice or his nominee which was improper. It was stated on behalf of the 
Union of India that there was no question of two Secretaries overriding the 
opinion of the Chief Justice of India or his nominee since primacy of the 
Chairperson was inbuilt in the system and this aspect will be duly clarified. 
7. In regard to certain other defects in the Act, pointed out by the 
petitioners, it was submitted that the Union Government will examine them 
and wherever necessary suitable amendments will be made. 
8. In view of these submissions, on 9-1-2007, this Court made an order 
reserving liberty to the Union Government to mention the matter for listing 
after the appropriate amendments were made in the Act. 
9. On 21-1-2009, when arguments in CA No. 3067 of 2004 and CA No. 
3717 of 2005, which related to the challenge to Parts I-B and I-C of the 
Companies Act, 1956 were in progress before the Constitution Bench, it 
was submitted that these matters involved a similar issue and they could 
be tagged and disposed of in terms of the decision in those appeals. 
Therefore the Constitution Bench directed these cases to be listed with 
those appeals. even though there is no order of reference in these matters. 
CA No. 3067 of 2004 and CA No. 3717 of 2005 were subsequently heard 
at length and were reserved for judgment. These matters which were 
tagged were also reserved for judgment. 
178 
Page 178 
-A79 
10. We have disposed of CA No. 3067 of 2004 and CA No. 3717 of 2005 
today (Union of India vs. Madras Bar Association, (2010) 11 SCC 1), by a 
separate order. Insofar as these cases are concerned, we find that TC 
(Civil) No 150 of 2006 involves the challenge to Article 323-B of the 
Constitution. The said article enables appropriate legislatures to provide by 
law, for adjudication or trial by tribunals or any disputes, complaints. or 
offences with respect to all or any of the matters specified in clause (2) 
thereof. Sub-clause (i) of clause (2) of Article 323-B enables such tribunals 
to try offences against laws with respect to any of the matters specified in 
sub-clauses (a) to (h) of clause (2) of the said article. 
It One of the contentions urged in support of the challenge to Article 323-
6 relate to the fact that tribunals do not follow the normal rules of evidence 
contained in the Evidence Act, 1872. In criminal trials, an accused is 
presumed to be innocent till proved guilty beyond reasonable doubt, and 
the Evidence Act plays an important role, as appreciation of evidence and 
consequential findings of facts are crucial, The trial would require 
experience and expertise in criminal law, which means that the Judge or 
the adjudicator to be legally trained. Tribunals which follow their own 
summary procedure, are not bound by the strict rules of evidence and the 
members will not be legally trained. Therefore it may lead to convictions of 
persons on evidence which is not sufficient in probative value or on the 
basis of inadmissible evidence. It is submitted that it would thus be a 
retrograde step for separation of executive from the judiciary. 
12. Appeals on issues on law are traditionally heard by the courts. Article 
323-B enable constitution of tribunals which will be hearing appeals on 
pure questions of law which is the function of the courts. In L. Chandra 
Kumar v. Union of India, (1997) 3 SCC 261, this Court considered the 
validity of only clause (3)(d) of Article 323-B but did not consider the 
validity of other provisions of Article 323-B. 
13. The appeals relating to constitutional validity of the National Company 
Law Tribunals under the Companies Act, 1956 did not involve the 
consideration of Article 323-B. The constitutional issues raised in TO (Civil) 
No. 150 of 2006 were not touched on as the power to establish Company 
Tribunals was not traceable to Article 323-B but to several entries of Lists I 
and III of the Seventh Schedule and consequently there was no challenge 
to this article. 
14. The basis of attack in regard to Parts I-B and I-C of the Companies Act 
and the provisions of the NTT Act are completely different. The challenge 
to Parts I-13 and I-C of the Companies Act, 1956 seeks to derive support 
from Article 323-B by contending that Article 323-B is a bar for constitution 
of any tribunal in respect of matters not enumerated therein. On the other 
hand the challenge to the NTT Act is based on the challenge to Article 
323-B itself 
15. We therefore find that these petitions relating to the validity of the NTT 
Act and the challenge to Article 323-B raise issues which did not arise in 
179 
Page 179 
the two civil appeals. Therefore these cases cannot be disposed of in 
terms of the decision in the civil appeals but require to be heard 
separately. We accordingly direct that these matters be delinked and listed 
separately for hearing." 
63(i) A perusal of the judgment rendered in Kesavananda Bharati case (supra) 
reveals, that "separation of powers" creates a system of checks and balances, by 
reasons of which, powers are so distributed, that none of the three organs 
transgresses into the domain of the other. The concept ensures the dignity of the 
individual. The power of "judicial review" ensures, that executive functioning 
confines itself within the framework of law enacted by the legislature. 
Accordingly, the demarcation of powers between the legislature, the executive 
and the judiciary, is regarded as the basic element of the constitutional scheme. 
When the judicial process is prevented by law, from determining whether the 
action taken, was or was not, within the framework of the legislation enacted, it 
would amount to the transgression of the adjudicatoryideterminatory process by 
the legislature. Therefore, the exclusion of the power of "judicial review", would 
strike at the "basic structure" of the Constitution. 
(ii) 	
In Indira Nehru Gandhi case (supra), this Court arrived at the conclusion, 
that clause (4) of Article 329A of the Constitution, destroyed not only the power of 
"judicial review", but also the rule of "separation of powers". By the above 
legislative provision, an election declared void, on the culmination of an 
adjudicatory process, was treated as valid. Meaning thereby, that the judicial 
process was substituted by a legislative pronouncement. It was held, that the 
issue to be focused on was, whether the amendment which was sought to be 
ISO 
Page 180 
assailed, violated a principle which constituted the "basic structure" of the 
Constitution. The argument raised in opposition was, that a determination which 
had a bearing on just one (or a few) individual(s) would not raise such an issue. 
The query was answered by concluding, that it would make no difference 
whether it related to one case, or a large number of cases. Encroachment on the 
"basic structure" of the Constitution would be invalid, irrespective of whether, it 
related to a limited number of individuals or a large number of people. The view 
expressed was, that if lawmakers were to be assigned the responsibility of 
administering those laws, and dispensing justice, then those governed by such 
laws would be left without a remedy in case they were subjected to injustice. For 
the above reason, clause (4) of Article 329A was declared invalid. This Court by 
majority held, that clauses (4) and (5) of Article 329A were unconstitutional and 
void. 
(iii) 	
In Minerva Mills Ltd. case (supra), first and foremost, this Court confirmed 
the view expressed in Kesavananda Bharati case (supra) and Indira Nehru 
Gandhi case (supra). that the amending power of the Parliament, was not 
absolute. The Parliament. it was maintained, did not have the power to amend 
the "basic structure" of the Constitution. A legislative assertion, that the enacted 
law had been made, for giving effect to a policy to secure the provisions made in 
Part IV of the Constitution, had the effect of excluding the adjudicatory process. 
In the case on hand. this Court arrived at the conclusion, that Section 4 of the 
Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act was beyond the amending power of 
the Parliament, and the same was void, because it had the effect of damaging 
181 
Page 181 
the basic and essential features of the Constitution and destroying its "basic 
structure', by totally excluding any challenge to any law, even on the ground, 
whether it was inconsistent with or it had abridged, any of the rights conferred by 
Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution. 	
Furthermore, Section 55 of the 
Constitution (Forty-second Amendment), Act was held to be beyond the 
amending power of the Parliament. It was held to be void, as it had the effect of 
removing all limitations on the powers of Parliament, to amend the Constitution 
including, the power to alter its basic and essential features, i.e., its "basic 
structure". According to this Court, the reason for a broad ['separation of powers" 
under the Constitution was, because concentration of powers in any one of the 
organs of the Government, would destroy the foundational premise of a 
democratic Government. The illustrations narrated in the judgment are of some 
relevance. We shall therefore, narrate them hereunder, in our own words: 
Take for example a case where the executive, which is in-charge of 
administration, acts to the prejudice of a citizen. And a question arises, as to 
what are the powers of the executive, and whether the executive had acted 
within the scope of its powers. Such a question obviously, cannot be left to 
the executive to decide, for two very good reasons. Firstly, because the 
decision would depend upon the interpretation of the Constitution or the laws, 
which are, pre-eminently fit to be decided by the judiciary, as it is the judiciary 
alone which would be possessed of the expertise in decision making. And 
secondly, because the legal protection afforded to citizens by the Constitution 
182 
Page 182 
A83 
or the laws would become illusory, 	
were left to the executive to determine 
the legality. of its own actions. 
(b) 	
Take for example, a case where the legislature makes a law, which 
is to the prejudice of a citizen. And a dispute arises, whether in making the 
law the legislature had acted outside the area of its legislative competence, or 
whether the law was violative of the fundamental rights of the citizen, or of 
some other provision(s) of law. Its resolution cannot be left to the legislature 
to decide, for two very good reasons. Firstly, because the decision would 
depend upon the interpretation of the Constitution or the laws, which are, pre-
eminently fit to be decided by the judiciary, as it is the judiciary alone which 
would be possessed of the expertise in decision making. And secondly, 
because the legal protection afforded to citizens, by the Constitution or the 
laws would become illusory, if it were left to the legislature to determine the 
legality of its own actions. 
On the basis of the examples cited above, this Court concluded, that the creation 
of an independent machinery, for resolving disputes, was constitutionally vested 
with the judiciary. The judiciary was vested with the power of "judicial review", to 
determine the legality of executive action, and the validity of laws enacted by 
legislature. It was further held, that it was the solemn duty of the judiciary under 
the Constitution, to keep the different organs of the State, such as the executive 
and the legislature, within the limits of the powers conferred upon them by the 
Constitution. It was accordingly also held, that the power of "judicial review" was 
an integral part of India's constitutional system, and without it, the "rule of law" 
183 
Page 183 
would become a teasing illusion, and a promise of unreality. Premised on the 
aforesaid inferences, this Court finally concluded, that if there was one feature of 
the Indian Constitution, which more than any others, was its "basic structure' 
fundamental to the maintenance of democracy and the 'We of law", it was the 
power of 'judicial review". While recording the aforementioned conclusion, this 
Court also recorded a clarificatOry note, namely, that it should not be taken, that 
an effective alternative institutional mechanism or arrangement for judicial 
review' could not be made by Parliament. It was, however, clearly emphasized, 
that "judicial review" was a vital principle of the Indian Constitution, and it could 
not be abrogated, without affecting the ''basic structure' of the Constitution. It is 
therefore, that it came to be held, that a constitutional amendment, which had the 
effect of taking away the power of "judicial review", by providing, that it would not 
be liable to be questioned, on any ground, was held to be beyond the amending 
power of the Parliament. For, that would make the Parliament the sole judge, of 
the constitutional validity, of what it had done, and thereby, allow it to determine 
the legality of its own actions. In the above judgment, the critical reflection, in our 
considered view was expressed by the words, ''Human ingenuity, limitless though 
it may be, has yet not devised a system, by which the liberty of the people can be 
protected, except for the intervention of the courts of law". 
(iv) In S.P. Gupta case (supra), the concept of Independence of judiciary" 
came up for consideration before this Court. This Court having examined the 
issue, arrived at certain conclusions with reference to High Court and Supreme 
Court Judges. It was held, that their appointment and removal, as also their 
184 
Page 184 
transfer, deserved to be preserved, within the framework of the judicial fraternity. 
Likewise, the foundation of appointment of outside Chief Justices, was made with 
a similar objective. Based on the same, parameters were also laid down, in 
respect of appointment of Judges to the Supreme Court. The consideration even 
extended to the appointment of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. All this, 
for ensuring judicial autonomy. It was felt that independence of the judiciary, 
could be preserved only if primacy in the above causes rested with the judiciary 
itself, with a minimal involvement of the executive and the legislature. It needs to 
be highlighted, that independence of judges of the High Courts and the Supreme 
Court was considered as salient, to ensure due exercise of the power of "judicial 
review". It would be pertinent to mention, that the judgment rendered by this 
Court in S.P. Gupta case (supra) came to be doubted in Subhash Sharma v. 
Union of India, (1991) Suppl. 1 SCC 574. 	
Thereupon, the matter was 
reconsidered by a constitution bench of nine Judges in, Supreme Court 
Advocates on Record Association v. Union of India, (1993) 4 SCC 441. On the 
subject of preserving independence in respect of appointment of judges of the 
High Courts, as also their transfer, the position recorded earlier in S.P.Gupta 
cas (supra) remained substantially unaltered. So also, of appointments of Chief 
Justices of High Courts and the Supreme Court. It was reiterated, that to ensure 
judicial independence, primacy in all these matters should be with the judiciary. 
(v) Having recorded the determination rendered by this Court to the effect that 
"separation of powers', "rule of law" and "judicial review" at the hands of an 
independent judiciary, constitute the "basic structure" of the Constitution, we are 
185 
Page 185 
in a position now to determine, how the aforesaid concepts came to be 
adopted by this Court, while adjudicating upon the validity of provisions similar to 
the ones, which are subject of consideration, in the case on hand. The first 
controversy arose with reference to the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1965, which 
was enacted under Article 323A of the Constitution. In S.P. Sampath Kumar 
case (supra), it was sought to be concluded, that the power of “judicial review' 
had been negated by the aforementioned enactment, inasmuch as, the avenue 
of redress under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution before the High Court, 
was no longer available. It was also sought to be asserted, that the tribunal 
constituted under the enactment, being a substitute of the High Court, ought to 
have been constituted in a manner, that it would be able to function in the same 
manner as the High Court itself. Since insulation of the judiciary from all forms of 
interference, even from the coordinate branches of the Government, was by now 
being perceived as a basic essential feature of the Constitution, it was felt that 
the same independence from possibility of executive pressure or influence, 
needed to be ensured for the Chairman, Vice Chairman and Members of the 
administrative tribunal. 	
In recording its conclusions, even though it was 
maintained, that "judicial review" was an integral part of the "basic structure" of 
the Constitution, yet it was held, that Parliament was competent to amend the 
Constitution, and substitute in place of the High Court, another alternative 
institutional mechanism or arrangement. This Court, however cautioned, that it 
was imperative to ensure, that the alternative arrangement, was no less 
independent, and no less judicious, than the High Court (which was sought to be 
1 86 
Page 186 
;s1 
replaced) itself. 	
This was conveyed by observing, ''if any constitutional 
amendment made by the Parliament takes away from the High Court the power 
of 'judicial review" in any particular area, and vests it in any other institutional 
mechanism or authority, it would not be violative of the basic structure doctrine 
so long as the essential condition is fulfilled, namely, that the alternative 
institutional mechanism or authority set up by the Parliament by amendment is 
no less effective than the High Court'. The exclusion of the High Courts' 
jurisdiction under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, it was held, would 
render the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985 unconstitutional, unless the 
amendments to the provisions of Sections 4, 6 and 8 thereof, as suggested by 
this Court, were carried out. Insofar as Section 4 is concerned, it was suggested 
that it must be amended so as not to confer absolute and unfettered discretion on 
the executive in matters of appointment of the Chairman, Vice Chairman and 
Members of the administrative tribunals. Section 6(1)(o) was considered to be 
invalid, and as such, needed to be deleted. 	
It was also indicated, that 
appointment of Chairman, Vice Chairman and Administrative Members should be 
made by the executive, only in consultation with the Chief Justice of India, and 
that, such consultation had to be meaningful and effective, inasmuch as, 
ordinarily the recommendation of the Chief Justice of India ought to be accepted, 
unless there were cogent reasons not to. If there were any reasons, for not 
accepting the recommendation, they needed to be disclosed to the Chief Justice. 
Alternatively, it was commended, that a high powered Selection Committee 
headed by the Chief Justice or a sifting Judge of the Supreme Court, or of the 
IS? 
Page 1B7 
_40 
concerned High Court (nominated by the Chief Justice of India), could be set up 
for such selection. If either of these two modes of appointment was adopted, it 
was believed, that the impugned Act would be saved from invalidation. It was 
mentioned, that Section 6(2) also needed to be amended, so as to make a 
District Judge or an Advocate, who fulfilled the qualifications for appointment as a 
judge of the High Court, eligible for appointment as Vice Chairman. With 
reference to Section 8 it was felt, that a term of five years of office, would be too 
short and ought to be suitably extended. It was so felt, because the presently 
prescribed tenure would neither be convenient to the persons selected for the 
job, nor expedient to the scheme of adjudication contemplated under the 
Administrative Tribunals Act. It was also opined, that the Government ought to 
set up a permanent bench wherever there was a seat of the High. Court. And if 
that was not feasible, at least a circuit bench of the administrative tribunal, 
wherever there is a seat of the High Court. That would alleviate the hardship, 
which would have to be faced by persons, who were not residing close to the 
places at which the benches of the tribunal were set up. In this behalf, it may 
only be stated that all the suggestions made by this Court were adopted. 
(vi) Post S.P. Sampath Kumar case (supra), divergent views came to be 
expressed in a number of judgments rendered by this Court. It is therefore, that 
the judgment in S.P.Sampath Kumar case (supra), came up for reconsideration 
in L. Chandra Kumar case (supra). On reconsideration, this Court declared, that 
the power of "judicial review" over legislative action was vested in the High 
Courts under Article 226, and in the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the 
188 
Page 188 
Constitution. 'Judicial review" was again held to be an integral and essential 
feature of the Constitution, constituting its 'basic structure". 	
It was further 
concluded. that ordinarily the power of High Courts and the Supreme Court. to 
test the constitutional validity of legislations, could never be ousted or excluded. 
It was also held, that the power vested in the High Courts of judicial 
superintendence over all Courts and tribunals within their respective jurisdictions, 
was also part of the "basic structure of the Constitution. And that, a situation 
needed to be avoided where High Courts were divested from their judicial 
functions, besides the power of constitutional interpretation. Referring to the 
inappropriate and ineffective functioning of the tribunals, this Court observed, that 
the above malady was on account of lack of the responsibility, of fulfilling the 
administrative requirements of administrative tribunals. It was opined, that the 
malady could be remedied by creating a single umbrella organization, to ensure 
the independence of the members of such tribunals, and to provide funds for the 
fulfillment of their administrative requirements. Although the determination of the 
governmental organization, to discharge such a role was left open, it was 
recommended, that it should preferably be vested with the Law Department. 
With reference to the controversies which arose before the tribunals, it was held, 
that matters wherein interpretation of statutory provisions or rules, or where the 
provisions of the Constitution were expected to be construed, the same would 
have to be determined by a bench consisting of at least two Members, one of 
whom must be a Judicial Member. Having found that the provisions of the 
Administrative Tribunals Act, had impinged on the power of 'judicial review" 
189 
Page 109 
vested in the High Court, clause (2)(d) of Article 323A and clause (3)(d) of Article 
323B, to the extent they excluded the jurisdiction of the High Courts and the 
Supreme Court under Articles 226/227 and 32 of the Constitution, were held to 
be unconstitutional. Likewise, the ''exclusion of jurisdiction' clauses in all other 
legislations enacted under the aegis of Articles 323A and 323B, were also held to 
be unconstitutional. In view of the above, it was concluded, that the jurisdiction 
conferred upon the High Court under Articles 226/227, and upon the Supreme 
Court under Article 32 of the Constituflon, was a part of the Inviolable 'basic 
structure' of the Constitution. Since the said jurisdiction could not be ousted, 
jurisdiction vested in the tribunals would be deemed to be discharging a 
supplemental role, in the exercise of the powers conferred by Articles 226/227 
and 32 of the Constitution. Although it was affirmed, that such tribunals would be 
deemed to be possessed of the competence to test the constitutional validity of 
the statutory provisions and rules, it was provided, that all decisions of tribunals 
would be subject to scrutiny before a division bench of the High Court, within 
whose jurisdiction the concerned tribunal had passed the order. In the above 
view of the matter, it was held that the tribunals would act like courts of first 
instance, in respect of the areas of law, for which they had been constituted. 
After adjudication at the hands of the tribunals, it would be open for litigants to 
directly approach the High Courts. Section 5(6) of the Administrative Tribunals 
Act, interpreted in the manner indicated above, was bestowed with validity. 
(vii) In Union of India v. Madras Bar Association case (supra). all the 
conclusions/propositions narrated above, were reiterated and followed, 
190

• 
whereupon the fundamental requirements, which need to be kept in mind while 
transferring adjudicatory functions from courts to tribunals, were further 
crystalised. It came to be unequivocally recorded that tribunals vested with 
judicial power (hitherto before vested in, or exercised by courts), should possess 
the same independence, security and capacity, as the courts which the tribunals 
are mandated to substitute. The Members of the tribunals discharging judicial 
functions, could only be drawn from sources possessed of expertise in law, and 
competent to discharge judicial functions. Technical Members can be appointed 
to tribunals where technical expertise is essential for disposal of matters, and not 
otherwise. Therefore it was held, that where the adjudicatory process transferred 
to tribunals, did not involve any specialized skill, knowledge or expertise, a 
provision for appointment of Technical Members (in addition to, or in substitution 
of Judicial Members) would constitute a clear case of delusion and 
encroachment upon the independence of the judiciary, and the "rule of law". The 
stature of the members, who would constitute the tribunal, would depend on the 
jurisdiction which was being transferred to the tribunal. In other words, if the 
jurisdiction of the High Court was transferred to a tribunal, the stature of the 
members of the newly constituted tribunal, should be possessed of qualifications 
akin to the judges of the High Court. Whereas in case, the jurisdiction and the 
functions sought to be transferred were being exercised/performed by District 
Judges, the Members appointed to the tribunal should be possessed of 
equivalent qualifications and commensurate stature of District Judges. The 
conditions of service of the members should be such, that they are in a position 
191 
Page 191 
to discharge their duties in an independent and impartial manner. The manner of 
their appointment and removal including their transfer, and tenure of their 
employment, should have adequate protection so as to be shorn of legislative 
and executive interference. The functioning of the tribunals, their infrastructure 
and responsibility of fulfilling their administrative requirements ought to be 
assigned to the Ministry of Law and Justice. Neither the tribunals nor their 
members, should be required to seek any facilities from the parent ministries or 
department concerned. 	
Even though the legislature can reorganize the 
jurisdiction of judicial tribunals, and can prescribe the qualifications/eligibility of 
members thereof, the same would be subject to "judicial review" wherein it would 
be open to a court to hold, that the tribunalization would adversely affect the 
adjudicatory standards, whereupon it would be open to a court to interfere 
therewith. Such an exercise would naturally be, a part of the checks and 
balances measures, conferred by the Constitution on the judiciary, to maintain 
the rule of "separation of powers' to prevent any encroachment by the legislature 
or the executive. 
64. The position of law summarized in the foregoing paragraph constitutes a 
declaration on the concept of the 'basic structure', with reference to the concepts 
of "separation of powers", the "rule of law'', and "judicial review". Based on the 
conclusions summarized above, it will be possible for us to answer the first issue 
projected before us, namely, whether "judicial review" is a part of the "basic 
structure' of the Constitution. The answer has inevitably to be in the affirmative. 
From the above determination, the petitioners would like us to further conclude, 
192 
Page 192 
-4 - 
that the power of "judicial review" stands breached with the promulgation of the 
NTT Act. This Court in Minerva Mills Ltd. case (supra) held, that it should not be 
taken, that an effective alternative institutional mechanism or arrangement for 
'judicial review" could not be made by Parliament, The same position was 
reiterated in S.P. Sampath Kumar case (supra), namely, that "judicial review" 
was an integral part of the "basic structure" of the Constitution. All the same it 
was held, that Parliament was competent to amend the Constitution, and 
substitute in place of the High Court, another alternative institutional mechanism 
(court or tribunal). It would be pertinent to mention, that in so concluding, this 
Court added a forewarning, that the alternative institutional mechanism set up by 
Parliament through an amendment, had to be no less effective than the High 
Court itself. In L. Chandra Kumar case (supra), even though this Court held that 
the power of "judicial review" over legislative action vested in High Courts, was a 
part of the "basic structure", it went on to conclude that "ordinarily" the power of 
High Courts to test the constitutional validity of legislations could never be 
ousted. All the same it was held, that the powers vested in High Courts to 
exercise judicial superintendence over decisions of all courts and tribunals within 
their respective jurisdictions, was also a part of the "basic structure" of the 
Constitution. 	
The position that Parliament had the power to amend the 
Constitution, and to create a court/tribunal to discharge functions which the High 
Court was discharging, was reiterated, in Union of India v. Madras Bar 
Association case (supra). It was concluded, that the Parliament was competent 
to enact a law, transferring the jurisdiction exercised by High Courts, in regard to 
193 
Page 193 
-A1 
any specified subject, to any court/tribunal. But it was clarified, that Parliament 
could not transfer power vested in the High Courts, by the Constitution itself. We 
therefore have no hesitation in concluding, that appellate powers vested in the 
High Court under different statutory provisions, can definitely be transferred from 
the High Court to other courts/tribunals, subject to the satisfaction of norms 
declared by this Court. Herein the jurisdiction transferred by the NTT Act was 
with regard to specified subjects under tax related statutes. That, in our opinion. 
would be permissible in terms of the position expressed above. Has the NTT Act 
transferred any power vested in courts by the Constitution? The answer is in the 
negative. The power of "judicial review' vested in the High Court under Articles 
226 and 227 of the Constitution, has remained intact. This aspect of the matter, 
has a substantial bearing, to the issue in hand. And will also lead to some 
important inferences. Therefore, it must never be overlooked, that since the 
power of "judicial review" exercised by the High Court under Articles 226 and 227 
of the Constitution has remained unaltered, the power vested in High Courts to 
exercise judicial superintendence over the benches of the NTT within their 
respective jurisdiction, has been consciously preserved. 	
This position was 
confirmed by the learned Attorney General for India, during the course of 
hearing. Since the above jurisdiction of the High Court has not been ousted, the 
NTT will be deemed to be discharging a supplemental role, rather than a 
substitutional role. In the above view of the matter, the submission that the NTT 
Act violates the "basic structure" of the Constitution, cannot be acquiesced to. 
194 
Page 194 
65. Even though we have declined to accept the contention advanced on 
behalf of the petitioners, premised on the "basic structure" theory, we feel it is still 
essential for us, to deal with the submission advanced on behalf of the 
respondents in response. We may first record the contention advanced on 
behalf of the respondents. It was contended, that a legislation (not being an 
amendment to the Constitution), enacted in consonance of the provisions of the 
Constitution, on a subject within the realm of the concerned legislature, cannot 
be assailed on the ground that it violates the "basic structure' of the Constitution. 
For the present controversy, the respondents had placed reliance on Articles 245 
and 246 of the Constitution, as also, on entries 77 to 79, 82 to 84, 95 and 97 of 
the Union List of the Seventh Schedule, and on entries 11A and 46 of the 
Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule. Based thereon it was asserted, that 
Parliament was competent to enact the NTT Act. For examining the instant 
contention, let us presume it is so. 	
Having accepted the above, our 
consideration is as follows. 	
The Constitution regulates the manner of 
governance in substantially minute detail. It is the fountainhead distributing 
power, for such governance. The Constitution vests the power of legislation at 
the Centre, with the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, and in the States with the 
State Legislative Assemblies (and in some States, the State Legislative Councils, 
as well). 	
The instant legislative power is regulated by 'Part XI" of the 
Constitution. The submission advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for 
the respondents, insofar as the instant aspect of the matter is concerned, is 
premised on the assertion that the NTT Act has been enacted strictly in 
195 
Page 195 
consonance with the procedure depicted in "Part Xl" of the Constitution. It is also 
the contention of the learned counsel for the respondents, that the said power 
has been exercised strictly in consonance with the subject on which the 
Parliament is authorized to legislate. Whilst dealing with the instant submission 
advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the respondents, all that needs 
to be stated is, that the legislative power conferred under "Part Xl" of the 
Constitution has one overall exception, which undoubtedly is, that the "basic 
structure" of the Constitution, cannot be infringed, no matter what. On the instant 
aspect, some relevant judgments, rendered by constitutional benches of this 
Court, have been cited hereinabOVe. It seems to us, that there is a fine 
difference in what the petitioners contend, and what the respondents seek to 
project. The submission advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the 
petitioners does not pertain to lack of jurisdiction or inappropriate exercise of 
jurisdiction. The submission advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for 
the petitioners pointedly is, that it is impermissible to legislate in a manner as 
would violate the "basic structure" of the Constitution. This Court has repeatedly 
held, that an amendment to the provisions of the Constitution, would not be 
sustainable if it violated the "basic structure' of the Constitution, even though the 
amendment had been carried out, by following the procedure contemplated 
under "Part XI" of the Constitution. This leads to the determination, that the 
'basic structure' is inviolable. In our view, the same would apply to all other 
legislations (other than amendments to the Constitution) as well, even though the 
legislation had been enacted by following the prescribed procedure, and was 
t96 
Page 196 
- A97 - 
within the domain of the enacting legislature, any infringement to the "basic 
structure" would be unacceptable. Such submissions advanced at the hands of 
the learned counsel for the respondents are, therefore, liable to be disallowed. 
And are accordingly declined. 
Whether the transfer of adiudicatory functions vested in the High Court to 
the NTT violates recognized constitutional conventions?  
Ill. 	
Whether while transferring lurisdiction to a newly created court/tribunal, it is 
essential to maintain the standards and the stature of the court rel? 
66- 	
In addition to the determination on the adjudication of the present 
controversy on the concept of basic structure, the instant matter calls for a 
determination on the sustainability of the NTT Act, from other perspectives also. 
We shall now advert to the alternative contentions. First and foremost, it was the 
submission of the learned counsel for the petitioners, that it is impermissible for 
legislature to abrogate/divest the core judicial appellate functions, specially, the 
functions traditionally vested in a superior court, to a quasi judicial authority 
devoid of essential ingredients of the superior court. The instant submission was 
premised on the foundation, that such action is constitutionally impermissible. 
67. In order to determine whether or not the appellate functions which have 
now been vested with the NH, constituted the core judicial appellate function 
traditionally vested with the jurisdictional High Courts, we have recorded under 
the heading — The Historical Perspective", legislative details, pertaining to the 
Income Tax Act, the Customs Act and the Excise Act. We had to do so, for that 
was the only manner to deal with the instant aspect of the controversy. A perusal 
of the historical perspective reveals, that as against the initial assessment of 
197 
Page 197 
tax/duty liability, the first forum for challenge has traditionally been with an 
executive appellate adjudicatory authority. Legislative details reveal, that for 
some time there was a power of reference, exercisable on "questions of law/. 
The adjudication thereof rested with the jurisdictional High Courts. The second 
appellate remedy has always been before a quasi-judicial appellate authority, 
styled as an Appellate Tribunal. Across the board, under all the enactments 
which are relevant for the present controversy, proceedings before the Appellate 
Tribunal have been legislatively described as "judicial proceedings". 	
It is, 
therefore apparent, that right from the beginning, the clear legislative 
understanding was, that from the stage of the proceedings before the Appellate 
Tribunal. the proceedings were of the nature of "judicial proceedings/. Again 
across the board, under all the enactments, relevant for the present controversy, 
questions of law were originally left to be adjudicated by the jurisdictional High 
Courts. The reference jurisdiction, was substituted in all the enactments, and 
converted into appellate jurisdiction. The instant appellate jurisdiction was 
vested with the jurisdictional High Court. Under the Income Tax Act, 1981, 
Section 260A, provided an appellate remedy from an order passed by the 
Appellate Tribunal, to the jurisdictional High Court. Similarly Section 129A of the 
Customs Act, 1962, and Section 35G of the Central Excise Act, 1944, provided 
for an appellate remedy from the concerned Appellate Tribunal to the High Court. 
The jurisdictional High Court would hear appeals on questions of law, against 
orders passed by the Appellate Tribunals. It is, therefore apparent, that right 
from the beginning, well before the promulgation of the Constitution, the core 
198 
Page 198 
judicial appellate functions, for adjudication of tax related disputes, were vested 
with the jurisdictional High Courts. The High Courts have traditionally, been 
exercising the jurisdiction to determine questions of law, under all the above tax 
legislations. In this view of the matter, it is not possible for us to conclude, that it 
was not justified for the learned counsel for the petitioners to contend, that the 
core judicial appellate function in tax matters, on questions of law, has 
uninterruptedly been vested with the jurisdictional High Courts. 
68. Before we proceed with the matter further, it is necessary to keep in mind 
the composition of the adjudicatory authorities which have historically dealt with 
the matters arising out of tax laws. First, we shall deal with the composition of 
the Appellate Tribunals. All Appellate Tribunals which are relevant for the 
present controversy were essentially comprised of Judicial Members, besides 
Accountant or Technical Members. To qualify for appointment as a Judicial 
Member, it was essential that the incumbent had held a judicial office in India for 
a period of 10 years, or had practiced as an Advocate for a similar period. It is 
the above qualification, which enabled the enactments to provide, by a fiction of 
law, that all the said Appellate Tribunals were discharging "Judicial proceedings''. 
The next stage of appellate determination, has been traditionally vested with the 
High Courts. The income-tax legislation, the customs legislation, as well as, the 
central excise legislation uniformly provided, that in exercise of its appellate 
jurisdiction, the jurisdictional High Court would adjudicate appeals arising out of 
orders passed by the respective Appellate Tribunals. The said appeals were by 
a legislative determination, to be heard by benches comprising of at least two 
199 
Page 199 
judges of the High Court. Adjudication at the hands of a bench consisting of at 
least two judges. by itself is indicative of the legal complications, insofar as the 
appellate adjudicatory role, of the jurisdictional High Court was concerned. It 
would, therefore, not be incorrect to conclude, by accepting the submissions 
advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the petitioners, that before and 
after promulgation of the Constitution, till the enactment of the NTT Act, all 
legislative provisions vested the appellate power of adjudication, arising out of 
the Income Tax Act, the Customs Act and the Excise Act, on questions of law, 
with the jurisdictional High Courts. 
69. Having recorded the above conclusion, the next issue to be determined is 
whether the adjudication of the disputes arising out of the provisions under 
reference, must remain within the realm of the jurisdictional High Courts? The 
instant proposition has two perspectives. 	
Firstly, whether constitutional 
interpretation in the manner accepted the world over (details whereof have been 
narrated by us under the heading — "The Issues canvassed on behalf of the 
petitioners", under the sub-title — "The second contention"), would be a 
constitutional mandate, for the appellate jurisdiction pertaining to tax matters, to 
remain with the High Court? Secondly, whether the express provisions of the 
Constitution mandate, that tax issues should be decided by the concerned 
jurisdictional High Court? 
70. 	
We shall first deal with the first perspective, namely, whether constitutional 
interpretation in the manner accepted the world over, would be a constitutional 
mandate for appellate jurisdiction on tax matters, to remain with the jurisdictional 
200 
Page 200 
30 / 
High Court. Insofar as the instant aspect of the matter is concerned, reliance 
was placed on judgments emerging out of the Constitutions of Jamaica, Ceylon, 
Australia and Canada, rendered either by the Privy Council or the highest Courts 
of the concerned countries. The contention of the learned counsel for the 
petitioners was, that the constitutions of the above countries were based on the 
Westminster model. It was further pointed out, that the Indian Constitution was 
also based on the Westminster model, and that, the instant position stands 
recognized in the judgment rendered by this Court in Union of India v. Madras 
Bar Association case (supra). Incidentally, it may be mentioned that we have 
extracted paragraph 101 of the above judgment hereinabove, wherein it is so 
recorded. 	
It is accordingly the contention of the learned counsel for the 
petitioners, that the judgments relied upon by the petitioners on the instant 
aspect of the matter, would be fully applicable to the controversy in hand. Under 
the constitutional convention, adverted to in the judgments referred to on behalf 
of the petitioners, it was submitted, that judicial power which rested with definite 
courts at the time of enactment of the constitutions based on the Westminster 
model, had to remain with the same courts, even after the constitutions had 
become effective and operational. Furthermore, it was submitted, that the 
judicial power had to be exercised in the same manner as before, i.e., whether by 
a judge sitting singly, or with other judges. And therefore it was asserted, that on 
constitutional conventions well recognized the world over, appellate jurisdiction in 
respect of tax matters, would have to remain with the jurisdictional High Courts, 
and would have to be determined by a bench of at least two judges of the High 
201 
Page 201 
3 c)b 
r- 
Court, as was the position before the enactment of the Constitution., and, as has 
been the position thereafter, till the promulgation of the NTT Act. 
71. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the submission advanced at 
the hands of the learned counsel for the petitioners, insofar as the first 
perspective is concerned. We find substance in the submission advanced at the 
hands of the learned counsel for the petitioners, but not exactly in the format 
suggested by the learned counsel. A closer examination of the judgments relied 
upon lead us to the conclusion, that in every new constitution, which makes 
separate provisions for the legislature, the executive and the judiciary, it is taken 
as acknowledged/conceded, that the basic principle of "separation of powers" 
would apply. And that, the three wings of governance would operate in their 
assigned domain/province. The power of discharging judicial functions, which 
was exercised by members of the higher judiciary, at the time when the 
constitution came into force, should ordinarily remain with the court, which 
exercised the said jurisdiction, at the time of promulgation of the new constitution. 
But the judicial power could be allowed to be exercised by an analogous/similar 
court/tribunal, with a different name. However, by virtue of the constitutional 
convention, while constituting the analogous court/tribunal, it will have to be 
ensured, that the appointment and security of tenure of judges of that court would 
be the same, as of the court sought to be substituted. This was the express 
conclusion drawn in Hinds case (supra). In Hinds case it was acknowledged, 
that Parliament was not precluded from establishing a court under a new name, 
to exercise the jurisdiction that was being exercised by members of the higher 
202 
Page 202 
36 
 
judiciary, at the time when the constitution came into force. But when that was 
done, it was critical to ensure, that the persons appointed to be members of such 
a courUtribunal, should be appointed in the same manner, and should be entitled 
to the same security of tenure, as the holder of the judicial office, at the time 
when the constitution came into force. Even in the treatise "Constitutional Law of 
Canada' by Peter W. Hogg, it was observed; if a province invested a tribunal with 
a jurisdiction of a kind, which ought to properly belong to a superior, district or 
county Court, then that court/tribunal (created in its place), whatever is its official 
name, for constitutional purposes has to, while replacing a superior, district or 
county Court, satisfy the requirements and standards of the substituted court. 
This would mean, that the newly constituted courUtribunal will be deemed to be 
invalidly constituted, till its members are appointed in the same manner, and till 
its members are entitled to the same conditions of service, as were available to 
the judges of the court sought to be substituted. In the judgments under 
reference it has also been concluded, that a breach of the above constitutional 
convention could not be excused by good intention (by which the legislative 
power had been exercised, to enact a given law). We are satisfied, that the 
aforesaid exposition of law, is in consonance with the position expressed by this 
Court. while dealing with the concepts of "separation of powers", the ''rule of law" 
and "judicial review". In this behalf, reference may be made to the judgments in 
L. Chandra Kumar cas (supra), as also, in Union of India v. Madras Bar 
Association case (supra). Therein, this Court has recognized, that transfer of 
jurisdiction is permissible. but in effecting such transfer, the court to which the 
203 
Page 203 
power of adjudication is transferred, must be endured with salient characteristics, 
which were possessed by the court from which the adjudicatory power has been 
transferred. In recording our conclusions on the submission advanced as the 
first perspective, we may only state, that our conclusion is exactly the same as 
was drawn by us while examining the petitioners' previous submission, namely, 
that it is not possible for us to accept, that under recognized constitutional 
conventions, judicial power vested in superior courts cannot be transferred to 
coordinate courts/tribunals. The answer is, that such transfer is permissible. But 
whenever there is such transfer, all conventions/customs/practices of the court 
sought to be replaced, have to be incorporated in the court/tribunal created. The 
newly created court/tribunal would have to be established, in consonance with 
the salient characteristics and standards of the court which is sought to be 
substituted. 
72. 	
Now we shall deal with the second perspective, namely, whether the 
provisions of the Indian Constitution itself mandate, that tax issues at the 
appellate level, must be heard by the concerned jurisdictional High Court. 
Insofar as the instant aspect of the matter is concerned, learned counsel for the 
petitioners placed reliance on Articles 50 and 225 of the Constitution. Article 50 
of the Constitution was relied upon to demonstrate the intent of the framers of the 
Constitution, namely, that they wished to ensure the exclusivity and the 
separation of the judiciary, from the executive. It is not necessary for us to deal 
with the instant aspect of the matter, for the reason that, in the judgments 
204 
Page 209 
rendered by this Court which have been referred to by us hereinabove, the issue 
has already been debated with reference to Article 50 of the Constitution. 
73. 	
The other provision relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioners is 
Article 225 of the Constitution. The tenor of the submission advanced by the 
learned counsel for the petitioners, has been recorded by us while dealing with 
the second contention (advanced on behalf of the petitioners). The same may be 
adverted to. There can be no doubt whatsoever, that Article 225 of the 
Constitution does expressly provide, that the jurisdiction of existing High Courts 
and the respective powers of the judges thereof "shall be the same as 
immediately before the commencement of the Constitution". It is also apparent, 
that the proviso thereto expressly mandates, "that any restriction to which the 
exercise of original jurisdiction by any of the High Courts with respect to any 
matter concerning the revenue or concerning any act ordered or done in 
collection thereof was subject immediately before the commencement of the 
Constitution shall no longer apply to the exercise of such jurisdiction'. Insofar as 
the contention emerging out of the proviso is concerned, it needs to be pointed 
out, that the same pertains to "the exercise of original jurisdiction by any of the 
High Courts'. It is, therefore apparent, that the issue in hand, namely, the 
appellate jurisdiction vested with the jurisdictional High Courts, under the 
provisions of the Income Tax Act, the Customs Act and the Excise Act, has no 
bearing to the proviso under reference. We may therefore conclude by 
recording, that the instant submission advanced on behalf of the petitioners, is 
not made out from Article 225 of the Constitution.

IV. 
Whether Company Secretaries should be allowed to appear before the  
NTT to represent a party to an appeal in the same fashion and on parity with.  
Accountants?  
V. 
Whether Section 13(1) of the NTT Act insofar as it allows Accountants to  
mpresent a party to an appeal before the NTT is valid?  
74. 
We may first take up for consideration, Writ Petition (Civil) no. 621 of 2007. 
The same has been filed by members of the Institute of Company Secretaries of 
India, seeking the right to appear before the NTT, as representatives of a party to 
an appeal. Respondent no. 5 in the said Writ Petition, is the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants. It has entered appearance and canvassed that the claim 
of Company Secretaries and Chartered Accountants is not comparable. While 
indicating the permissibility of Chartered Accountants to represent a party to an 
appeal before the NTT on account of their special acumen, their claim is, that this 
issue raised on behalf of the Company Secretaries is a matter of policy. And 
therefore, it would not be open to this Court to bestow, on account of parity, the 
right to represent a party to an appeal, before the NTT, on Company Secretaries. 
75. 
While examining the above contention, we will indeed be dealing with 
Section 13 of the NIT Act, which has already been extracted while recording the 
submissions advanced on behalf of the petitioners, with reference to the fourth 
contention. A perusal of the said provision reveals, that a party to an appeal 
(other than the Revenue) may appear either in person, or may authorize one or 
more Chartered Accountants, or legal practitioners, or any person duly 
authorized by him, to present his case before the NTT. The pointed submission 
advanced on behalf of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India was, that 
under Section 13 of the NTT Act, Chartered Accountants are entitled to appear 
206 
Page 206 
307- 
 
before the NTT. because of their recognized acumen. It was submitted, that it is 
the prerogative of the legislature and a matter of policy, to determine persons 
who are entitled to appear before the NTT. It was pointed out, that courts should 
not ordinarily interfere in such policy matters. It is therefore, that learned counsel 
for the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, has placed reliance on the 
decision rendered by this Court in Delhi Pradesh Registered Medical 
Practitioners v. Director of Health, Delhi Administration Services, (1997) 11 SCC 
687, wherefrom our pointed attention was invited to the following observations,- 
"2. 	
The propriety and validity of the public notice issued by the Director, 
Health Services, Delhi Administration indicating that the Indian Medicine 
Central Council had recognized Ayurveda Ratna and Vaid Visharada 
degrees awarded by the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, Prayag, Allahabad only 
up to 1967 and the certificate of Ayurveda Ratna and Vaid Visharada given 
by the said organization after 1967 not being recognized under the said 
Act, registration obtained by any person as a medical practitioner on the 
basis of such degrees therefore would not be recognized and any person 
having such qualification would not be entitled to practise in Delhi are 
impugned in these appeals. It was also indicated in the said public notice 
that no Indian university or Board conducts one year's course for giving the 
bachelor's degree in Ayurvedic Medicine or through correspondence

We are, however, unable to accept such contention of Mr. Mehta. 
Sub-section (3) of Section 17 of the Indian Medicine Central Council Act, 
1970, in our view, only envisages that where before the enactment of the 
said Indian Medicine Central Council Act, 1970 on the basis of requisite 
qualification which was then recognized, a person got himself registered as 
medical pracfitioner in the disciplines contemplated under the said Act or in 
the absence of any requirement for registration such person had been 
practising for five years or intended to be registered and was also entitled 
to be registered, the right of such person to practise in the discipline 
concerned including the privileges of a registered medical practitioner 
stood protected even though such practitioner did not possess requisite 
qualification under the said Act of 1970. It may be indicated that such view 
of ours is reflected from the Objects and Reasons indicated for introducing 
207 
Page 207 
sub-section (3) of Section 17 in the Act. In the Objects and Reasons, it was 
mentioned: 
"Mho Committee are of the opinion that the existing rights and 
privileges of practitioners of Indian Medicine should be given 
adequate safeguards. The Committee, in order to achieve this 
object, have added three new paragraphs to sub-section (3) of the 
clause protecting (I) the rights to practise of those practitioners of 
Indian Medicine who may not, under the proposed legislation, 
possess a recognized qualification subject to the condition that they 
are already enrolled on a State Register of Indian Medicine on the 
date of commencement of this Act, (ii) the privileges conferred on 
the practitioners of Indian Medicine enrolled on a State Register, 
under any law in force in that State, and (iii) the right to practise in a 
State of those practitioners who have been practis ng Indian 
Medicine in that State for not less than five years where no register 
of Indian Medicine was maintained earlier." 
As it is not the case of any of the writ petitioners that they had 
acquired the degree in between 1957 (sic 1967) and 1970 or on the date of 
enforcement of provisions of Section 17(2) of the said Act and got 
themselves registered or acquired right to be registered, there is no 
question of getting the protection under sub-section (3) of Section 17 of the 
said Act. It is to be stated here that there is also no challenge as to the 
validity of the said Central Act, 1970. The decision of the Delhi High Court 
therefore cannot be assailed by the appellants. We may indicate here that 
it has been suomitted by Mr. Mehta and also by Ms. Sona Khan appearing 
In the appeal arising out of Special Leave Petition No. 6167 of 1993 that 
proper consideration had not been given to the standard of education 
imparted by the said Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, Prayag and expertise 
acquired by the holders of the aforesaid degrees awarded by the said 
nstitution. In any event, when proper medical facilities have not been 
made available to a large number of poorer sections of the society, the ban 
mposed on the practitioners like the writ petitioners rendering useful 
service to the needy and poor people was wholly unjustified. It is not  
necessary for this Court to consider such submissions because the same  
remains in the realm of policy decision of other constitutional functionaries.  
We may also indicate here that what constitutes proper education and  
requisite expertise for a practitioner in Indian Medicine must be left to the  
proper authority having reauisite knowledge in the subiect.  As the decision 
of the Delhi High Court is justified on the face of legal position flowing from 
the said Central Act of 1970, we do not think that any interference by this 
Court is called for. These appeals therefore are dismissed without any 
order as to costs."

Reliance was also placed on State of Rajasthan v Lata Arun, (2002) 6 SCC 252, 
wherein it was held as under- 
"4. 	
The question which arises for determination in this cas is whether 
the respondent had the eligibility qualification for admission in General 
Nursing and Midwifery and Staff Nurse Course (hereinafter referred to as 
"Nursing Course") commencing in the year 1990. The Director, Medical 
and Health Services had invited applications by 15-12-1989 from eligible 
candidates for admission in the Nursing Course to be started from January 
1990. It was stated in the notification that the candidates should have 
passed first year of three years' degree course (TDC) or 10+2; and that the 
candidates with Science subjects (Biology, Chemistry, Physics) will be 
given preference. During the period, the Indian Nursing Council had issued 
a set of Syllabi and Regulations for courses in General Nursing and 
Midwifery in which the prescribed minimum educational qualification for all 
candidates was 12th class-pass or its equivalent preferably with Science 
subjects. 
xxx

10. The points involved in the case are twofold: one relating to prescription 
of minimum educational qualification for admission to the course and the 
other relating to recognition of the Madhyama Certificate issued by the 
Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, Allahabad as equivalent to or higher than +2 or 
1st year of TDC for the purpose of admission Both these points relate to  
matters in the realm of policy decision to be taken by the State  
Government or the authority vested with power under any statute. It is not  
for courts to determine whether a particular educational Qualification  
possessed by a candidate should or should not be recognized as  
equivalent to the prescribed qualification in the case. That is not to say that 
such matters are not justiciable. In an appropriate case the court can 
examine whether the policy decision or the administrative order dealing 
with the matter is based on a fair, rational and reasonable ground; whether 
the decision has been taken on consideration of relevant aspects of the 
matter; whether exercise of the power is obtained with male fide intention; 
whether the decision serves the purpose of giving proper training to the 
candidates admitted or it is based on irrelevant and irrational 
considerations or intended to benefit an individual or a group of 
candidates/'

In addition to the above submissions it was contended, that the Chartered 
Accountants are permitted to appear before a large number of tribunals/fora. 
Illustratively it was submitted, that under Section 288 of the Income Tax Act, 
1961, read with Rule 50 of the Income Tax Rules, 1962, Chartered Accountants 
209 
Page 209 
are permitted to appear in income tax matters. Likewise, it was asserted that 
Chartered Accountants are entitled to appear in Central Excise matters under 
Section 35Q of the Central Excise Act, 1944. They are also permitted to appear 
in matters arising out of the Customs Act, 1962 (wherefor reliance was placed on 
Section 146A of the Customs Act, 1962, read with Rule 9(a), Customs (Appeals) 
Rules, 1982). Besides the aforesaid provisions, it was contended, that Chartered 
Accountants were entitled to appear before various tribunals/fora under different 
statutory provisions, such as under the Securities and Exchange Board of India 
Act, 1992, the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act. 1956, the Telecom 
Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1991, the Companies Act, 2013, the Company 
Law Board Regulations, 1991, the Competition (Amendment) Act, 2007, and the 
Special Economic Zone Rules, 2006. We were informed, that Chartered 
Accountants were also entitled to appear before the Central Electricity 
Regulatory Commission vide Notification dated 27.8.1999. It was submitted, that 
if Chartered Accountants are competent to canvass complicated disputes which 
arise under the provisions referred to hereinabove, there should be no difficulty in 
allowing them to appear before the NTT, as also, to consider them eligible for 
being appointed as Members of the NTT. It was therefore asserted, that Section 
13 of the NTT Act rightly permitted Chartered Accountants to represent a party to 
an appeal before the NTT. The submission on behalf of the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants was, that Company Secretaries were not comparable 
with them, and therefore, as a matter of policy, they had no legitimate claim for 
being allowed to represent a party before the NTT.

It is pertinent to record, that during the course of hearing we had required 
learned counsel representing the petitioners., to file a compilation of cases, 
wherein provisions of different laws on diverse subjects had to be taken into 
consideration. while deciding tax related disputes. 	
In compliance, learned 
counsel have submitted a compilation on behalf of the Madras Bar Association 
On Transferred Case (Civil) no. 150 of 2006), tabulating by way of illustration, 
reported cases on tax disputes, which also involved provisions of different laws 
on different subjects. The compilation brought to our notice is summarized

Allied subjectfiaw adjudicated upon 
A Hindu idol is a juristic entity that is given the status of a 
human being capable of having property and it can be called 
an Individual'. 
Though a widow cannot be a coparcener, she has 
copercenary interests and she is also a member of the 
coparcenary by virtue of the rights conferred by the Hindu 
Women's Rights to Property Act, 1937. 
There is no distinction between property obtained by a 
member of HUF on a partition and the property that belongs 
to a member as a sole surviving coparcener by right of 
survivorship. 
A unilateral declaration of a Hindu coparcener, whereby he 
throws his self-acquired property into the common stock of 
the joint family property, does not amount to a transfer and, 
therefore, such an act does not constitute a gift. 
The Supreme Court held that the wife and daughters 
inheriting the property of a male Hindu do not form a HUF 
and that they could not also form such family by agreement 
among themselves by throwing their respective inherited 
shares in the hotchpot. 
The gift of property of a HUF to the members of the family is 
not void but voidable. 
211 
Page 211 
Even the fact that the wife had given up her right to 
maintenance does not mean that she is no longer a member 
of the family of her husband. 
The amount spent by a Hindu father on his daughters 
marriage is treated as maintenance (and not a gift) under 
the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956. 	 „. 
A sole surviving coparcener can constitute a Hindu - 
undivided family. 
The separate property of the father inherited upon intestacy 
by the son is to be treated as the son s separate property - 
and not as the property of his joint family. 
If on partition of the family, separate shares are allotted to 
the karta, his wife and children, the existence of the Hindu 
undivided family comes to an end, and the share of the 
erstwhile karta becomes his separate property. 
A joint Hindu family, as such, cannot be a partner in a firm. 
However, it may enter into a partnership through its karts.  
A female member, as a member of a joint family, can 
become a partner in a firm as the representative of her 
family. 
Unequal partition amongst coparceners in a HUF does not 
amount to a gift. 
In the reunion of a HUF, all assets originally partitioned need 
not be pooled back. 
The scope of the theory of blending in Hindu law was 
discussed in detail. 
Gift deed executed by the assessee in favour of her 
daughter to secure her future after marriage was not due to _. 
any legal obligation enjoined upon the assessee by virtue of 
Section 20 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, but -
for other considerations. Therefore, the gift being voluntary 
within the meaning of Section 2(xii) of the Gift Tax Act, 1964, 
was liable to tax.

Allied subject/law adjudicated upon 
A private company becoming a public company by virtue of 
the provisions of Section 43A of the Companies Act, 1956 
may still not become a "company in which the public are 
substantially interested" due to the restriction imposed on its 
shareholders upon transferability of its shares to the other 
members of the public. 
Presumption that a registered shareholder holds the share in 
his own right and any claim that shares were being held as a 
nominee has to be proved by the person claiming so. 
Shares of a single type issued by a State Financial 
Corporation providing for minimum and maximum dividend 
cannot be termed as Wreference shared. 
(i) Partnership is merely an association of persons for 
carrying on the business of partnership and, in law, the firm 
name is a compendious method of describing the partners. 
Such is, however, not the case of a company which stands 
as a separate juristic entity distinct from the shareholders. 
(ii) 
Shareholders have no right in the property of the 
company. They are only entitled to dividends and a share in 
the surplus, if any, after the dissolution of the company. 
Although company is a separate legal entity, in certain 
exceptional cases, the Court can lift the veil of the corporate 
entity and have regard to the economic realities behind the 
legal façade.

Valuation of shares-reasonable valuation has to be accepted 
unless the valuation shocks conscience of the court. 
In company law, there is no transfer of a share when there is 
a transfer of underlying assets. Various issues of lifting of - 
the corporate veil discussed. Also discussed, briefly, the 
enforceability of shareholders' agreements. 
A firm of 20 major partners and 3 minor partners does not 
contravene Section 11(2) of the Companies Act, 1956 since 
minors are not to be reckoned as partners for the purposes 
of the calculation. 
Amalgamation - date of transfer/ date of amalgamation / 
transfer is the date specified in the scheme as the transfer 
date. 
a) On amalgamation there is an extinguishment of rights 
and, therefore, there is a transfer. 
b) The amalgamation scheme sanctioned by the court 
would be an instrument within the meaning of Section 2(1) of 
the Bombay Stamp Act, 1958, and liable for stamp duty. A 
document creating or transferring a right is an instrument. 
Redemption of preference shares amounts to transfer and is 
liable to capital gains. 
Gains arising out of slump sale of business as a going 
concern is liable to tax under Section 41(2) on itemized 
basis if slump sale is determined on valuation of each asset/ -
liability. 
Valuation of bonus shares - The correct method to apply in --
cases where bonus shares rank pad passu is to take the - 
cost of the original shares and to spread it over all the -
original as well as the bonus shares and to find out the 
average price of all the shares. 
Page 219 
315-  
When a shareholder gets a bonus share the value of the 
original share held by him goes down. In effect, the 
shareholder gets two shares instead of the one share held 
by him and the market value as well as the intrinsic value of 
the two shares put together will be the same or nearly the 
same as the value of the original share before the bonus 
issue. 
Issuance of share takes place when entry of name of 
subscriber or successful offerer is made in the Register of 
Members. 
Though no cash is paid by the shareholders for allotment of 
the bonus shares, the set-off for dividend which was due to 
be paid to the shareholder out of undistributed profits of 
company can be regarded as consideration for the bonus 
shares. Therefore, real cost of bonus shares to 
shareholder/assessee is the value of shares as shown in 
books of account of the company. 
Redemption of preference shares is "transfer' and liable to 
capital gains. 
Gains arising out of "slump sale" of a business as a going 
concern is liable to tax under Section 41(2) on itemized 
basis if the slump sale is determined on valuation of each 
asset/liability.

Transaction of a partner with the firm, during the subsistence 
of the firm requires a registered instrument, where the 
transaction involves immovable property. 
Distribution of assets on dissolution is not transfer by the 
firm. 
Validity of partnership — contribution of partner need not be 
cash or property. Skill and labor would constitute 
contribution. 
Minors who were admitted to the benefits of the partnership 
could not claim their share of goodwill on the reconstruction 
of the firm by excluding the minors and consequently they 
were not liable to gift-tax. 
The mere fact that two persons take a commission agency 
business jointly would not necessarily constitute a 
partnership between them. 
If a partnership has been entered between two persons of 
whom one is a benamidar of the other, there is no relation of 
partnership between the two persons and one person 
cannot constitute a firm. 
On retirement of a partner from the firm, there is no transfer 
of interest of the partner I the assets thereof including the 
goodwill. The amount received is no assessable as capital 
gains. This case law is valid even after amendment in 
Section 45(4) which talks of dissolution or otherwise 
transferred. 
It is open to the partners to agree not to take the whole of 
the firm's profits for their personal use and to reserve a part 
of the firm's profits for charity. 
A partner has no interest in the property of the firm. In a 
case where there are two partners and one signs a release 
deed to a property in favour of the other, it is in fact a 
transfer from the partnership to that partner.

_3023 -- 
It is apparent from the compilation extracted hereinabove, that the Members of 
the NTT would most definitely be confronted with the legal issues emerging out 
of Family Law, Hindu Law, Mohammedan Law, Company Law, Law of 
Partnership, Law related to Territoriality, Law related to Trusts and Societies, 
Contract Law, Law relating to Transfer of Property, Law relating to Intellectual 
Property, Interpretation of Statutes, and other Miscellaneous Provisions of Law, 
from time to time. The NTT besides the aforesaid statutes, will not only have to 
interpret the provisions of the three statutes, out of which appeals will be heard 
by it, but will also have to examine a challenge to the vires of statutory 
amendments made in the said provisions, from time to time, They will also have 
to determine in some cases, whether the provisions relied upon had a 
prospective or retrospective applicability. 
78. 	
Keeping in mind the fact, that in terms of Section 15 of the NTT Act, the 
NTT would hear appeals from the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal and the 
Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT) only on 
"substantial questions of law", it is difficult for us to appreciate the propriety of 
representafion, on behalf of a party to an appeal, through either Chartered 
Accountants or Company Secretaries, before the NTT. The determination at the 
hands of the NTT is shorn of factual disputes. It has to decide only "substantial 
questions of law". In our understanding, Chartered Accountants and Company 
Secretaries would at best be specialists in understanding and explaining issues 
pertaining to accounts. These issues would, fall purely within the realm of facts. 
We find it difficult to accept the prayer made by the Company Secretaries to 
223 
Page 223 
3Aui 
allow them, to represent a party to an appeal before the NH. Even insofar as 
the Chartered Accountants are concerned, we are constrained to hold that 
allowing them to appear an behalf of a party before the NTT, would be 
unacceptable in law. We accordingly reject the claim of Company Secretaries, to 
represent a party before the NTT. Accordingly the prayer made by Company 
Secretaries in Writ Petition (Civil) no. 621 of 2007 is hereby declined. While 
recording the above conclusion, we simultaneously hold Section 13(1). insofar as 
it allows Chartered Accountants to represent a party to an appeal before the 
NTT, as unconstitutional and unsustainable in law. 
VI. The constitutional validity of Sections 5 6 7 8 and 13 of the NTT Act  
79. 
We shall now endeavour to deal with the validity of some other individual 
provisions of the NTT Act, based on the parameters laid down by constitutional 
benches of this Court and on the basis of recognized constitutional conventions 
referable to constitutions framed on the Westminster model. While dealing with 
the prayers made in Writ Petition (Civil) no. 621 of 2007, we have already dealt 
with Section 13 of the NTT Act, and have held, the same to be partly 
unconstitutional. We shall now proceed chronologically, and examine the validity 
of Sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the NTT Act. 
80. 
We shall first examine the validity of Section 5 of the NTT Act. The basis 
of challenge to the above provision, has already been narrated by us while 
dealing with the submissions advanced on behalf of the petitioners, with 
reference to the fourth contention. According to the learned counsel for the 
224 
Page 224 
petitioners, Section 5(2) of the NTT Act mandates, that the NTT would ordinarily 
have its sittings in the National Capital Territory of Delhi. According to the 
petitioners, the aforesaid mandate would deprive the litigating assessee, the 
convenience of approaching the jurisdictional High Court in the State, to which he 
belongs. An assessee may belong to a distant/remote State, in which 
eventuality, he would not merely have to suffer the hardship of traveling a long 
distance, but such travel would also entail uncalled for financial expense. 
Likewise, a litigant assessee from a far-flung State may find it extremely difficult 
and inconvenient to identify an Advocate who would represent him before the 
NTT, since the same is mandated to be ordinarily located in the National Capital 
Territory of Delhi. Even though we have expressed the view, that it is open to the 
Parliament to substitute the appellate jurisdiction vested in the jurisdictional High 
Courts and constitute courts/tribunals to exercise the said jurisdiction, we are of 
the view, that while vesting jurisdiction in an alternative court/tribunal, it is 
imperative for the legislature to ensure, that redress should be available, with the 
same convenience and expediency, as it was prior to the introduction of the 
newly created court/tribunal. Thus viewed, the mandate incorporated in Section 
5(2) of the NTT Act to the effect that the sittings of the NTT would ordinarily be 
conducted in the National Capital Territory of Delhi, would render the remedy 
inefficacious, and thus unacceptable in law. The instant aspect of the matter was 
considered by this Court with reference to the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985, 
in S.P. Sampath Kumar case (supra) and L. Chandra Kumar case (supra), 
wherein it was held, that perm anent benches needed to be established at the 
225 
Page 225 
seat of every jurisdictional High Court. And if that was not possible, at least a 
circuit bench required to be established at every place where an aggrieved party 
could avail of his remedy. The position on the above issue, is no different in the 
present controversy. For the above reason, Section 5(2) of the NTT Act is in 
clear breach of the law declared by this Court. 
81- One needs to also examine sub-sections (2), (3), (4) and (5) of Section 5 
of the NTT Act, with pointed reference to the role of the Central Government in 
determining the sitting of benches of the NTT. The Central Government has 
been authorized to notify the area in relation to which each bench would exercise 
jurisdiction, to determine the constitution of the benches, and finally, to exercise 
the power of transfer of Members of one bench to another bench. One cannot 
lose sight of the fact, that the Central Government will be a stakeholder in each 
and every appeal/case, which would be filed before the NTT. It cannot, 
therefore, be appropriate to allow the Central Government to play any role, with 
reference to the places where the benches would be set up, the areas over which 
the benches would exercise jurisdiction, the composition and the constitution of 
the benches, as also, the transfer of the Members from one bench to another. It 
would be inappropriate for the Central Government, to have any administrative 
dealings with the NTT or its Members. In the jurisdictional High Courts, such 
power is exercised exclusively by the Chief Justice, in the best interest of the 
administration of justice. Allowing the Central Government to participate in the 
aforestated administrative functioning of the NTT, in our view, would impinge 
upon the independence and fairness of the Members of the NTT. For the NTT 
226 
Page 226 
Act to be valid, the Chairperson and Members of the NTT should be possessed 
of the same independence and security, as the judges of the jurisdictional High 
Courts (which the NTT is mandated to substitute). Vesting of the power of 
determining the jurisdiction, and the postings of different Members, with the 
Central Government, in our considered view, would undermine the independence 
and fairness of the Chairperson and the Members of the NTT, as they would 
always be worried to preserve their jurisdiction based on their 
preferences/inclinations in terms of work, and conveniences in terms of place of 
posting. An unsuitable/disadvantageous Chairperson or Member could be easily 
moved to an insignificant jurisdiction, or to an inconvenient posting. This could 
be done to chastise him, to accept a position he would not voluntarily accede to. 
We are, therefore of the considered view, that Section 5 of the NH Act is not 
sustainable in law, as it does not ensure that the alternative adjudicatory 
authority, is totally insulated from all forms of interference, pressure or influence 
from co-ordinate branches of Government. There is therefore no alternative, but 
to hold that sub-sections (2), (3), (4) and (5) of Section 5 of the NTT Act are 
unconstitutional. 
82. We shall now examine the validity of Section 6 of the NTT Act. The above 
provision has already been extracted in an earlier part of this judgment, while 
dealing with the submissions advanced on behalf of the petitioners, with 
reference to the fourth contention. A perusal of Section 6 reveals, that a person 
would be qualified for appointment as a Member, if he is or has been a Member 
of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal or of the Customs, Excise and Service Tax 
227 
Page 227 
Appellate Tribunal for at least 5 years. While dealing with the historical 
perspective, with reference to the Income Tax legislation, the Customs 
legislation, as also, the Central Excise legislation, we have noticed the eligibility 
of those who can be appointed as Members of the Appellate Tribunals 
constituted under the aforesaid legislations. Under the Income Tax Act, a person 
who has practiced in accountancy as a Chartered Accountant (under the 
Chartered Accountants Act, 1949) for a period of 10 years, or has been a 
Registered Accountant (or partly a Registered Accountant, and partly a 
Chartered Accountant) for a period of 10 years, is eligible to be appointed as an 
Accountant Member. Under the Customs Act and the Excise Act, a person who 
has been a member of the Indian Customs and Central Excise Service (Group 
A), subject to the condition, that such person has held the post of Collector of 
Customs or Central Excise (Level I), or equivalent or higher post, for at least 3 
years, is eligible to be appointed as a Technical Member. It is apparent from the 
narration recorded hereinabove, that persons with the above qualifications, who 
were appointed as Accountant Members or Technical Members in the respective 
Appellate Tribunals, are also eligible for appointment as Members of the NTT, 
subject to their having rendered specified years' service as such. The question 
to be determined is, whether persons with the aforesaid qualifications, satisfy the 
parameters of law declared by this Court, to be appointed as, Members of the 
NTT? And do they satisfy the recognized constitutional conventions? 
83. This Court has declared the position in this behalf in L. Chandra Kumar 
case (supra) and in Union of India v. Madras Bar Association case (supra), that 
228 
Page 228 
Technical Members could be appointed to the tribunals, where technical 
expertise is essential for disposal of matters, and not otherwise. It has also been 
held, that where the adjudicatory process transferred to a tribunal does not 
involve any specialized skill, knowledge or expertise, a provision for appointment 
of non-Judicial Members (in addition to, or in substitution of Judicial Members), 
would constitute a clear case of delusion and encroachment upon the 
' independence of judiciaryd and the "rule of law'. It is difficult to appreciate how 
Accountant Members and Technical Members would handle complicated 
questions of law relating to tax matters, and also questions of law on a variety of 
subjects (unconnected to tax), in exercise of the jurisdiction vested with the NTT. 
That in our view would be a tall order. An arduous and intimidating asking. 
Since the Chairperson/Members of the NTT will be required to determine 
"substantial questions of law", arising out of decisions of the Appellate Tribunals, 
it is difficult to appreciate how an individual, well-versed only in accounts, would 
be able to discharge such functions. Likewise, it is also difficult for us to 
understand how Technical Members, who may not even possess the qualification 
of law, or may have no experience at all in the practice of law, would be able to 
deal with "substantial questions of lawt. for which alone, the NTT has been 
constituted. 
84. We have already noticed hereinabove, from data placed on record by the 
learned counsel for the petitioners, that the NTT would be confronted with 
disputes arising out of Family Law, Hindu Law, Mohemmedan Law, Company 
Law, Law of Partnership, Law relating to Territoriality, Law relating to Trusts and 
229 
Page 229 
Societies, Contract Law, Law relating to Transfer of Property, Law relating to 
Intellectual Property, Interpretation of Statutes/Rules, and other Miscellaneous 
Provisions of Law. Besides the above, the Members of the NTT will regularly 
have to interpret the provisions of the Income Tax Act, the Customs Act and the 
Excise Act. We are of the considered opinion, that only a person possessing 
professional qualification in law, with substantial experience in the practice of 
law, will be in a position to handle the onerous responsibilities which a 
Chairperson and Members of the NH will have to shoulder. 
85. There seems to be no doubt, whatsoever, that the Members of a 
court/tribunal to which adjudicatory functions are transferred, must be manned by 
judges/members whose stature and qualifications are commensurate to the court 
from which the adjudicatory process has been transferred/ This position is 
recognized the world over. Constitutional conventions in respect of Jamaica, 
Ceylon, Australia and Canada, on this aspect of the matter have been delineated 
above. The opinion of the Privy Council expressed by Lord Diplock in Hind case 
(supra), has been shown as being followed in countries which have constitutions 
on the Westminster model. The Indian Constitution is one such Constitution. 
The position has been clearly recorded while interpreting constitutions framed on 
the above model, namely, that even though the legislature can transfer judicial 
power from a traditional court, to an analogous court/tribunal with a different 
name, the court/tribunal to which such power is transferred, should be possessed 
of the same salient characteristics, standards and parameters, as the court the 
power whereof was being transferred. It is not possible for us to accept, that 
230 
Page 230 
- 33 ) r 
Accountant Members and Technical Members have the stature and qualification 
possessed by judges of High Courts. 
86. It was not disputed, that the NTT has been created to handle matters 
which were earlier within the appellate purview of the jurisdictional High Courts. 
We are accordingly satisfied, that the appointment of Accountant Members and 
Technical Members of the Appellate Tribunals to the NTT, would be in dear 
violation of the constitutional conventions recognized by courts, the world over. 
References on questions of law (under the three legislative enactments in 
question), were by a legislative mandate, required to be adjudicated by a bench 
of at least two judges of the jurisdictional High Court. When the remedy of 
reference (before the High Court) was converted into an appellate remedy (under 
the three legislative enactments in question), again by a legislative mandate, the 
appeal was to be heard by a bench of at least two judges, of the jurisdictional 
High Court. One cannot lose sight of the fact, that hitherto before, the issues 
which will vest in the jurisdiction of the NTT, were being decided by a bench of at 
least two judges of the High Court. The onerous and complicated nature of the 
adjudicatory process is clear. We may also simultaneously notice, that the power 
of 'judicial review" vested in the High Courts under Articles 226 and 227 of the 
Constitution has not been expressly taken away by the NTT Act. During the 
course of hearing, we had expressed our opinion in respect of the power of 
"judicial review" vested in the High Courts under Articles 226 and 227 of the 
Constitution. In our view, the power stood denuded, on account of the fact that, 
Section 24 of the NTT Act vested with an aggrieved party, a remedy of appeal 
,11 
Page 231 
,332-r  
against an order passed by the NTT, directly to the Supreme Court. Section 24 
aforementioned is being extracted hereunder: 
'24. Appeal to Supreme Court.- Any person including any department of 
the Government aggrieved by any decision or order of the National Tax 
Tribunal may file an appeal to the Supreme Court within sixty days from 
the date of communication of the decision or order of the National Tax 
Tribunal to him: 
Provided that the Supreme Court may, if it is satisfied that itthhin 
e appellant 
was prevented by sufficient cause from filing the appeal w  
period, allow it to be filed within such time as it may deem ft." 
In view of the aforestated appellate remedy, from an order passed by the NTT 
directly to the Supreme Court, there would hardly be any occasion, to raise a 
challenge on a tax matter, arising out of the provisions of the Income Tax Act, the 
Customs Act and the Excise Act, before a jurisdictional High Court. Even though 
the learned Attorney General pointed out, that the power of "judicial review" 
under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution had not been taken away, yet he 
acknowledged, that there would be implicit limitations where such power would 
be exercisable. Therefore, all the more, the composition of the NTT would have 
to be on the same parameters as judges of the High Courts. Since the 
appointments of the Chairperson/Members of the NTT are not on the parameters 
expressed hereinabove, the same are unsustainable under the declared law. A 
perusal of Section 6 of the NTT Act leaves no room for any doubt, that none of 
the above parameters is satisfied insofar as the appointment of Chairperson and 
other Members of the NTT is concerned. In the above view of the matter 
Section 6(2)(b) of the NH Act is liable to be declared unconstitutional. We 
declare it to be so. 
232

87. We would now deal with the submissions advanced by the learned counsel 
for the petitioners in respect of Section 7 of the NTT Act. It seems to us, that 
Section 7 has been styled in terms of the decision rendered by this Court in L. 
Chandra Kumar case (supra). Following the above judgment for determining the 
manner of selection of the Chairperson and Members of the NTT, is obviously a 
clear misunderstanding of the legal position declared by this Court. It should not 
have been forgotten, that under the provisions of the Administrative Tribunals 
Act, 1985, which came up for consideration in L. Chandra Kumar case (supra), 
the tribunals constituted under the said Act, are to act like courts of first instance. 
All decisions of the tribunal are amenable to challenge under Articles 226/227 of 
the Constitution before, a division bench of the jurisdictional High Court. In such 
circumstances it is apparent, that tribunals under the Administrative Tribunals 
Act, 1985, were subservient to the jurisdictional High Courts. The manner of 
selection, as suggested in L. Chandra Kumar case (supra) cannot therefore be 
adopted for a tribunal of the nature as the NTT. Herein the acknowledged 
position is, that the NTT has been constituted as a replacement of High Courts. 
The NTT is, therefore, in the real sense a tribunal substituting the High Courts. 
The manner of appointment of Chairperson/Members to the NTT will have to be, 
by the same procedure (or by a similar procedure), to that which is prevalent for 
appointment of judges of High Courts. Insofar as the instant aspect of the matter 
is concerned the above proposition was declared by this Court in Union of India 
v. Madras Bar Association case (supra), wherein it was held, that the stature of 
the Members who would constitute the tribunal, would depend on the jurisdiction 
233 
Page 233 
which was being transferred to the tribunal. Accordingly, if the jurisdiction of the 
High Courts is being transferred to the NTT, the stature of the Members of the 
tribunal had to be akin to that of the judges of High Courts. So also the 
conditions of service of its Chairperson/Members. And the manner of their 
appointment and removal, including transfers. Including, the tenure of their 
appointments. 
88. 	
Section 7 cannot even otherwise, be considered to be constitutionally 
valid, since it includes in the process of selection and appointment of the 
Chairperson and Members of the NTT, Secretaries of Departments of the Central 
Government. In this behalf, it would also be pertinent to mention, that the 
interests of the Central Government would be represented on one side, in every 
litigation before the NTT. It is not possible to accept a party to a litigation, can 
participate in the selection process, whereby the Chairperson and Members of 
the adjudicatory body are selected. This would also be violative of the 
recognized constitutional convention recorded by Lord Diplock in Hinds case 
(supra), namely, that it would make a mockery of the constitution, if the 
legislature could transfer the jurisdiction previously exercisable by holders of 
judicial offices, to holders of a new courvtribunal (to which some different name 
was attached) and to provide that persons holding the new judicial offices, should 
not be appointed in the manner and on the terms prescribed for appointment of 
Members of the judicature_ For all the reasons recorded hereinabove, we hereby 
declare Section 7 of the NTT Act, as unconstitutional. 
234 
Page 234 
89. 
Insofar as the validity of Section 8 of the NTT Act is concerned, it clearly 
emerges from a perusal thereof, that a Chairperson/Member is appointed to the 
NTT, in the first instance, for a duration of 5 years. Such Chairperson/Member is 
eligible for reappointment, for a further period of 5 years. We have no hesitation 
to accept the submissions advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the 
petitioners, that a provision for reappointment would itself have the effect of 
undermining the independence of the Chairperson/Members of the NTT. Every 
Chairperson/Member appointed to the NTT, would be constrained to decide 
matters, in a manner that would ensure his reappointment in terms of Section 8 
of the NTT Act. His decisions may or may not be based on his independent 
understanding. We are satisfied, that the above provision would undermine the 
independence and fairness of the Chairperson and Members of the NTT. Since 
the NTT has been vested with jurisdiction which earlier lay with the High Courts, 
in all matters of appointment, and extension of tenure, must be shielded from 
executive involvement. The reasons for our instant conclusions are exactly the 
same as have been expressed by us while dealing with Section 5 of the NTT Act. 
We therefore hold, that Section 8 of the NTT Act is unconstitutional. 
90. 
Sections 5, 6, 7, 8 and 13 of the NTT Act have been held by us (to the 
extent indicated hereinabove) to be illegal and unconstitutional on the basis of 
the parameters laid down by decisions of constitutional benches of this Court and 
on the basis of recognized constitutional conventions referable to constitutions 
framed on the Westminster model. In the absence of the aforesaid provisions 
which have been held to be unconstitutional, the remaining provisions have been 
235 
Page 235 
_33e) 
rendered otiose and worthless, and as such. the provisions of the NTT Act, as a 
whole, are hereby set aside. 
Conclusions:  
91 (i) The Parliament has the power to enact legislation, and to vest adjudicatory 
functions, earlier vested in the High Court, with an alternative court/tribunal. 
Exercise of such power by the Parliament would not per se violate the "basic 
structure" of the Constitution. 
(ii) 
Recognized constitutional conventions pertaining to the Westminster 
model, do not debar the legislating authority from enacting legislation to vest 
adjudicatory functions, earlier vested in a superior court, with an alternative 
court/tribunal. Exercise of such power by the Parliament would per se not violate 
any constitutional convention. 
(iii) 
The "basic structure" of the Constitution will stand violated, if while 
enacting legislation pertaining to transfer of judicial power, Parliament does not 
ensure, that the newly created courVtribunal, conforms with the salient 
characteristics and standards, of the court sought to be substituted. 
(iv) 
Constitutional conventions, pertaining to constitutions styled on the 
Westminster model, will also stand breached, if while enacting legislation, 
pertaining to transfer of judicial power, conventions and salient characteristics of 
the court sought to be replaced, are not incorporated in the court/tribunal sought 
to be created.

(v) 
The prayer made in Writ Petition (C) No.621 of 2007 is declined. Company 
Secretaries are held ineligible, for representing a party to an appeal before the 
NTT. 
(vi) 
Examined on the touchstone of conclusions Oii) and Ov) above, Sections 5, 
6, 7, 8 and 13 of the NTT Act (to the extent indicated hereinabove), are held to 
be unconstitutional. Since the aforesaid provisions, constitute the edifice of the 
NTT Act, and without these provisions the remaining provisions are rendered 
ineffective and inconsequential, the entire enactment is declared unconstitutional.

neurrin in the result 
1. 	
In these cases, essentially four contentions have been urged on behalf 
of the petitioners. The first contention is that the reason for setting up a 
National Tax Tribunal is non-existent as uniformity of decisions pertaining to 
tax laws is hardly a reason for interposing another tribunal between an 
appellate Tribunal and the Supreme Court, as High Court decisions are more 
or less uniform, since they follow the law laid down by each other. Since this 
is so, the Act must be struck down. The second contention is that it is 
238 
Page 238 
339 
impermissible for the legislature to divest superior courts of record from the 
core judicial function of deciding substantial questions of law. The third 
contention is as regards the Constitutional validity of Article 323-B being 
violative of the separation of powers doctrine, the rule of law doctrine and 
judicial review. The fourth contention concerns itself with the nitty gritty of 
the Act, namely, that various sections undermine the independence of the 
adjudicatory process and carmot stand judicial scrutiny in their present form. 
Since I am accepting the second contention urged by the petitioners, this 
judgment will not deal with any of the other contentions. 
2, 	
It is emphatically the province and duty of the 
judicial department to say what the law is. Those who 
apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity 
expound and interpret that rule." 
What was said over 200 years ago by Chief Justice John Marshall in 
the celebrated case of Marbury v. Madison, holds true even today in every 
great republican system of Government. 
These words take their colour from Alexander Hamilton's famous 
federalist Paper No.78 which ran thus: 
"Whoever attentively considers the different departments 
of power must perceive, that in a government in which they are 
separated from each other, the judiciaty, from the nature of its 
)(Unctions, will always be the least dangerous to the political 
rights of the Constitution; because it will be least in a capacity 
to annoy or injure them. The Executive not only dispenses the 
honors, but holds the sword of the community. The legislature 
239 
Page 229 
'3 'to 
not only commands the purse, but prescribes the rules by which 
the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated The 
judiciary, on the contrary, has no influence over either the 
sword or the purse; no direction either of the strength or of the 
wealth of the society; and can take no active resolution 
whatever It may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor 
WILL but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend upon 
the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its 
judgments. 
This simple view of the matter suggests several 
important consequences. It proves incontestably, that the 
judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the three 
departments of power, that it can never attack with success 
either of the other two; and that all possible care is requisite to 
enable it to defend itself against their attacks. It equally proves, 
that though individual oppression may now and then proceed 
from the courts of justice, the general liberty of the people can 
® he endangered from that quarter. I mean so long as the 
judiciary remains truly distinct from both the legislature and 
the Exe utive. For I agree that "there is no liberty i the 
a ated tom the le• islative and 
executive powers. And it proves, in the last place, that as liberty 
can have nothing to fear from the judiciary alone, but would 
have everything to fear from its union with either of the other 
departments; that as all the effects of such a union must ensue 
from a dependence of the former on the latter, notwithstanding 
a nominal and apparent separation; that as, from the natural 
feebleness of the judiciary, it is in continual jeopardy of being 
overpowered, awed, or influenced by its co-ordinate branches; 
and that as nothing can contribute so much to its firmness and 
independence as permanency in office, this quality may 
therefore be justly regarded as an indispensable ingredient in 
its constitution, and in a great measure, as the citadel of the 
public justice and the public security" 	
(Emphasis supplied) 
n. 	
The precise question arising in these appeals concerns the 
constitutional validity of the National Tax Tribunals Act, 2005. The question 
raised on behalf of the petitioners is one of great public importance and has, 
240 
Page 240 
34/ 
therefore, been placed before this Constitution Bench. Following upon the 
heels of the judgment in Union of India v. R.Gandhi, (2010) 11 SCC 1, 
these matters were delinked and ordered to be heard separately vide judgment 
and order dated 11°  May 2010 reported in (2010) 11 SCC 67. The precise 
question formulated on behalf of the petitioners is whether a tribunal can 
substitute the High Court in its appellate jurisdiction, when it comes to 
deciding substantial questions of law. 
Sections 15 and 24 of National Tax Tribunal Act state: 
"15. (1) An appeal shall lie to the National Tax Tribunal from 
eve"),  order passed in appeal by the Income-tax Appellate 
Tribunal and the Customs, Excise and Service Tax appellate 
Tribunal, if the National Tax Tribunal is satisfied that the case 
involves a substantial question of law, 
(2) The Chief Commissioner or the Commissioner of Income-tax 
or the Chief Commissioner or Commissioner of Customs and 
Central Excise, as the case may be, or an assessee aggrived by 
any order passed by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal or any 
person aggrieved by any order passed by the Customs, Excise 
and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as 
aggrieved person), may file an appeal to the National Tax 
Tribunal and such appeal under this sub-section shall- 
(a) be filed within one hundred and twenty days from the date 
on which the order appealed against is received by the assesee 
or the aggrieved person or the Chief Commissioner or 
Commissioner, as the case may be; 
(b) be in the form of a memorandum of appeal precisely stating 
therein the substantial question of law involved; and 
(c) be accompanied by such fees as may be prescribed: 
Provided that separate form of memorandum of appeal shall be 
filed for matters involving direct and indirect taxes: 
Provided further that the National Tax Tribunal may entertain 
the appeal within sixty days after the expiry of the said period of 
241 
Page 191 
3 Li 
one hundred and twenty days, if it is satisfied that the appellant 
was prevented by sufficient cause from preferring an appeal in 
time. 
(3) Where an appeal is admitted under sub-section (1), the 
National Tax Tribunal.- 
(a) shall formulate the question of law for hearing the appeal; 
and 
(b) may also determine any relevant issue in connection with the 
question so formulated- 
(i) which has not been so determined by the Income-tax 
Appellate Tribunal or by the Customs, Excise and Service Tax 
Appellate Tribunal or 
aD which has been wrongly determined by the income-tax 
Appellate Tribunal or by the Customs, Excise and Service Tax 
Appellate Tribunal, and shall decide the question of law so 
formulated and the other relevant issue so determined and 
deliver such judgment thereon containing the grounds on which 
such decision is founded and may award such cost as it deems 
fit 
(4) Where in any appeal under this section, the decision of the 
income-tax Appellate Tribunal or the Customs, Excise and 
Service Tax Appellate Tribunal involves the payment of any tax 
or duties, the assessee or the aggrieved person, as the case may 
be, shall not be allowed to prefer such appeal unless he deposits 
at least twenty-five per cent of such tax or duty payable on the 
basis of the order appealed against: 
Provided that where in a particular case the National Tax 
Tribunal is of the opinion that the deposit of tax or duty under 
this sub-section would case undue hardship to such person, it 
may dispense with such deposit subject to such conditions as it 
may deem fit to impose so as to safeguard the interest of 
revenue. 
24. Appeal to Supreme Court.- Any person including any 
department of the Government aggrieved by any decision or 
order of the National tax Tribunal may file an appeal to the 
Supreme Court within sixty days from the date of 
communication of the decision or order of the National Tax 
Tribunal to him; 
Provided that the Supreme Court may, if it is satisfied that the 
appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing the 
242 
Page 242 
appeal within the said period, allow to be filed within such 
time as it may deem fit." 
According to the petitioners, deciding substantial questions of law, 
even if they arise from specialized subject matters, would be a core function 
of the superior courts of India, and cannot be usurped by any other forum. 
To test the validity of this argument, we need to go to some constitutional 
fundamentals. 
It has been recognized that unlike the U.S. Constitution, the 
Constitution of India does not have a rigid separation of powers. Despite that, 
the Constitution contains several separate chapters devoted to each of the 
three branches of Government. Chapter IV of part V deals exclusively with 
the Union judiciary and Chapter V of part VI deals with the High Courts in 
the States. 
Article 50 of the Constitution states: 
"50. Separation of judiciary from executive: The State shall 
take steps to separate the judiciary from the executive in the 
public services of the State." 
8. 	
Art.129 states that the Supreme Court shall be a court of record and 
shall have all the powers of such a court including the power to punish for 
contempt of itself. Art.131 vests the Supreme Court with original jurisdiction 
in disputes arising between the Government of India and the States. Art. 132 
243 
Page 243 
to 134A vest an appellate jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases from the 
High Courts. Art. 136 vests the Supreme Court with an extraordinary 
discretionary jurisdiction to grant special leave to appeal from any judgment, 
decree, determination, sentence or order in any cause or matter passed or 
made by any court or tribunal in the territory of India. Under Art. 137, the 
Supreme Court is given power to review any judgment or order made by it. 
By Article 141, the law declared by the Supreme Court shall be binding on 
all courts within the territory of India. And by virtue of Art. 145(3) 
substantial questions as to the interpretation of the Constitution of India are 
vested exclusively in a bench of at least 5 Hon'ble Judges. 
Similarly, under Art. 214 High Courts for each State are established 
and under Art. 215 like the Supreme Court, High Courts shall be courts of 
record and shall have all the powers of such courts including the power to 
punish for contempt. Under Art. 225, the jurisdiction of, and the law 
administered in any existing High Courts, is preserved. Art. 226 vests the 
High Court with power to issue various writs for the protection of 
fundamental rights and for any other purpose to any person or authority. 
Under Art. 228 questions involving interpretation of the constitution are to be 
decided by the High Court alone when a court subordinate to it is seized of 
such question. Further, the importance of these provisions is further 
244 
Page 244 
--31/ 
highlighted by Art. 368 proviso which allows an amendment of all the 
aforesaid Articles only if such amendment is also ratified by the legislatures 
of not less than one half of the States. 
10. The Codc of Civil Procedure also contains provisions which vest the 
High Court with the power to decide certain questions of law under Section 
113 and, when they relate to jurisdictional errors, Section 115. 
11. Art. 227 is of ancient vintage. It has its origins in Section 107 of the 
Government of India Act 1915 which reads as follows: 
Each of the High Courts has superintendence over all 
courts for the time being subject to its appellate 
jurisdiction, and may do any of the following things, that is 
to say.- 
(a) 
Call for returns; 
(b) 
Direct the transfer of any suit or appeal from any 
such court to any other court of equal or superior 
jurisdiction; 
(c) 
Make and issue general rules and prescribe forms 
for regulating the practice and proceedings of such courts; 
(d) 
Prescribe forms in which books, entries and 
accounts shall he kept by the officers of any such courts; 
and settle tables of fees to be allowed to the sheriff, 
attorneys and all clerks and officers of courts: 
Provided that such rules, forms and tables shall not be 
inconsistent with the provisions of law for the time being in 
force, and shall require the previous approval, in the case 
of the high court at Calcutta, of the Governor-General in 
Council, and in other cases of the local government" 
12. Section 224 of the Government of India Act 1935 more or less adopted 
Section 107 of the Act of 1915 with a few changes 
245 
Page 295 
-3`11, " 
"(1)Every High Court shall have superintendence over all 
courts in India for the time being subject to as appellate 
jurisdiction, and may do any of the following thing, that is to 
say,- 
(a) 
call for returns: 
(b) 
make and issue general rules and prescribe forms for 
regulating the practice and proceedings of such courts; 
(c) 
prescribe forms in which books, entries and accounts 
shall be kept by the officers of any such courts; and 
(d) 
settle tables of fees to be allowed to the sheaf]; 
attorneys, and all clerks and officers of courts: 
Provided that such rules, forms and tables shall not be 
inconsistent with the provision of any law for the time being in 
force, and shall require the previous approval of the 
Governor. 
(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed as giving to a 
High Court any jurisdiction to question any judgment of any 
inferior Court which is not otherwise subject to appeal or 
revision." 
Article 227 of the Constitution states: 
227. Power of superintendence over all courts by the High 
Court 
(I) Every High Court shall have superintendence over all courts 
and tribunals throughout the territories in relation to which it 
exercises jurisdiction 
(2) Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing 
provisions, the High Court may 
(a) call for returns from such courts; 
(b) make and issue general rules and prescribe forms for 
regulating the practice and proceedings of such courts; and 
(c) prescribe forms in which books, entries and accounts shall 
be kept by the officers of any such courts 
(3) The High Court may also settle tables of fees to be allowed 
to the sheriff.  and all clerks and officers of such courts and to 
attorneys, advocates and pleaders practising therein: 
Provided that any rules made, firms prescribed or tables settled 
under clause ( 2 ) or clause ( 3 ) shall not be inconsistent with 
the provision of any law for the time being in pace, and shall 
require the previous approval of the Governor 
246 
Page 246 
r-397 
(4) Nothing in this article shall be deemed to confer on a High 
Court powers of superintendence over any court or tribunal 
constituted by or under any law relating N the Armed Forces." 
13. 
It will be noticed that Art. 227 adds the words "and tribunals" and 
contains no requirement that the superintendence over subordinate courts and 
tribunals should be subject to its appellate jurisdiction. 
14. 
In Waryam Singh v. Amarnath, 1954 SCR 565, Das,J. stated the 
High Courts power under Art. 227: 
"This power of superintendence conferred by article 227 is as 
pointed out by Harries CJ, in Dalmia Jain Airways Ltd. v. 
Sulcumar Mukherjee, to be exercised most sparingly and only in 
appropriate cases in order to keep the Subordinate Courts 
within the bounds of their authority and not for correcting mere 
errors. As rightly pointed out by the Judicial Commissioner in 
the case before us the lower courts in refusing to make an order 
for ejectment acted arbitrarily. The lower courts realized the 
legal position but in effect declined to do what was by section 
13(2) NJ incumbent on them to do and thereby refused to 
exercise jurisdiction vested in them by law. It was, therefore, a 
case which called for interference by the court of the Judicial 
Commissioner and it acted quite properly in doing so. " (at 571) 
15. 
It is axiomatic that the superintending power of the High Courts under 
Art. 227 is to keep courts and tribunals within the bounds of the law. Hence, 
errors of law that are apparent on the face of the record are liable to be 
corrected. In correcting such errors, the High Court has necessarily to state 
what the law is by deciding questions of law, which bind subordinate courts 
and tribunals in future cases. Despite the fact that there is no equivalent of 
247 
Page 247 
- 31/9 
An. 141 so far as High Courts are concerned, in East India Commercial Co. 
Ltd. Calcutta v. The Collector of Customs, (1963) 3 SCR 338, Subba Rao, 
stated: 
"This raises the question whether an administrative tribunal 
can ignore the law declared by the highest court in the State 
and initiate proceedings in direct violation of the law so 
declared. Under Art 215, every High Court shall be a court of 
record including the power to punish for contempt of itself. 
Under Art. 226, it has a plenary power to issue orders or writs 
for the enforcement of the fundamental rights and for any other 
purpose to any person or authority, including in appropriate 
cases any Government within its territorial jurisdiction. Under 
Art 227 it has jurisdiction over all courts and tribunals 
throughout the territories in relation to which it exercise 
jurisdiction. It would be anomalous to suggest that a tribunal 
over which the High Court has superintendant can ignore the 
law declared by that court and start proceedings in direct 
violation of it If a tribunal can do so, all the sub-ordinate 
courts can equally do so, for there is no specific provision, just 
like in the case of Supreme Court, making the law declared by 
the High Court binding on subordinate courts. It is implicit in  
the power of supervision conferred on a superior tribunal that 
all the tribunals subject to its supervision should conform to the  
law laid down by it Such obedience would also be conducive  
to their smooth working.' otherwise there would he confusion in  
the administration of law and respect for law would 
irretrievably suffer. We. therefore. hold that the law declared 
by the highest court in the State is bindino on authorities or  
tribunals under its superintendence and that they cannot  
ore it either in initiatin•a roceedin•or decidinr on the 
rights involved in such a proceeding. "(at 366) 
16. The aforesaid analysis shows that the decision by superior coatis of 
record of questions of law and the binding effect of such decisions are 
implicit in the constitutional scheme of things. It is obvious that it is 
248 
Page 298 
3 v9 - 
emphatically the province of the superior judicial),  to answer substantial 
questions of law not only for the case at hand but also in order to guide 
subordinate courts and tribunals in future. That this is the core of the judicial 
function as outlined by the constitutional provisions set out above. 
17. 
As to what is a substantial question of law has been decided way back 
in Sir Chunilal V. Malta v. TM Century Spinning and Manufacturing 
Co. Ltd., (1962) Suppl. 3 SCR 549 at pages 557-558 thus: 
....The proper test for determining whether a question of law 
raised in the case is substantial would, in our opinion, be 
whether it is of general public importance or whether it directly 
and substantially effects the rights of the parties and if so 
whether it is either an open question in the sense that it is not 
finally settled by this Court or by the Privy Council or by the 
Federal Court or is not free from difficulty or calls for 
discussion of alternative views. If the question is settled by the 
highest Court or the general principles to be applied in 
determining the question are well settled and there is a mere 
question of applying those principles or that the plea raised is 
palpably absurd the question would not be a substantial 
question of law.• 
18. 
It is clear, therefore, that the decision of a substantial question of law is 
a matter of great moment. It must be a question of law which is of general 
public importance or is not free from difficulty and/or calls for a discussion 
of alternative views. It is clear, therefore, that a judicially trained mind with 
the experience of deciding questions of law is a sine qua non in order that 
such questions be decided correctly. Interestingly enough, our attention has 
249 
Page 299 
been drawn to various Acts here appeals are on questions of law/substantial 
questions of law. 
"i) The Electricity Act, 2003 
125. Appeal to Supreme Court - Any person aggrieved by any 
decision or order of the Appellate Tribunal, may, file an appeal 
to the Supreme Court within sixty days from the date of 
communication of the decision or order of the Appellate 
Tribunal to him, on any one or more of the grounds specified in 
Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908)- 
Provided that the Supreme Court may, if it is satisfied that the 
appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing the 
appeal within the said period, allow it to be filed within a 
further period not exceeding sixty days. 
(h) The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 
Section 22. Appeal to Supreme Court - Any person aggrieved by 
any award, decision or order of the tribunal, may, file an appeal 
to the Supreme Court, within ninety days from the date of 
communication of the award, decision or order of Tribunal, to 
him, on any one or more of the grounds specified in Section 100 
of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908). 
Provided that the Supreme Court, entertain any appeal after the 
expiry of ninety days, if it is satisfied that the appellant was 
prevented by sufficient cause from preferring the appeal. 
(iii) The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1997 
Section 18. Appeal to Supreme Court - (I) Notwithstanding 
anything contained in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 
1908) or in any other law, an appeal shall lie against any order,

section 100 of that code. 
(2) No appeal shall lie against any decision or order made by 
the Appellate Tribunal with the consent of the parties. 
(3) Every appeal under this section shall he preferred within a 
period of ninety days from the date of the decision or order 
appealed against: 
Provided that the Supreme Court may entertain the appeal after

further period not exceeding sixty days. 
(h) Companies Act 1956 
Section 10GF. Appeal to Supreme Court. - Any person

Provided that the Supreme Court may, if it is satisfied that the 
appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing the 
appeal within the said period, allow it to be filed within a 
further period not exceeding sixty days." 
19. Whether one looks at the old Section 100 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure or Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure as substituted in 
1976, the result is that the superior courts alone are vested with the power to 
decide questions of law. 
Section 100 (Before amendment)  
"100(1). Save where otherwise expressly provided in the body 
of this Code or by any other law for the time being in force, an 
appeal shall lie to the High Court from every decree passed in 
appeal by any court subordinate to a High Court on any of the 
following grounds, namely: 
251 
Page 251 
35 
(a) 
the decision being contrary to law or to some usage 
having the force of law; 
(b) 
the decision having failed to determine some material 
issue of law or usage having the force of law; 
(c) 
a substantial error or defect in the procedure provided 
by this Code or by any other law for the time being in force, 
which may possibly have produced error or defect in the 
decision of the case upon the merits. 
(2) An appeal may lie under this section from an appellate 
decree passed ex-parte. 
Section 100 (After amendment)  
100. Second appeal 
(I) Save as otherwise expressly provided in the body of this 
Code or by any other law for the time being in force, an appeal 
shall lie to the High Court from every decree passed in appeal 
by any Court subordinate to the High Court, if the High Court 
is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question of law. 
(2) An appeal may lie under this section from an appellate 
decree passed exparte. 
(3) In an appeal under this section, the memorandum of appeal 
shall precisely state the substantial question of law involved in 
the appeal. 
(4) Where the High Court is satisfied that a substantial 
question of law is involved in any case, it shall formulate that 
question. 
(5) The appeal shall be heard on the question so formulated 
and the respondent shall, at the hearing of the appeal, be 
allowed to argue that the case does not involve such question : 
Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall be deemed to 
take away or abridge the power of the Court to hear, for 
reasons to be recorded the appeal on any other substantial 
question of law, not formulated by P if it is satisfied that the 
case involves such question." 
20. It is obvious that hitherto Parliament has entrusted a superior court of 
record with decisions on questions of law/substantial questions of law. Also, 
as has been pointed in Khehar, S's judgment traditionally, such questions 
252 
Page 252 
3S3- 
 
were always decided by the High Courts in the country. The present Act is a 
departure made for the first time by Parliament. 
21. 
In this regard, the respondents argued that since taxation is a 
specialised subject and there is a complete code laid down for deciding this 
subject, the present impugned Act being part of that code is constitutionally 
valid. For this purpose, the respondents have relied on a passage from the 
nine Judge Bench in Mafatlal Industries v. Union of India, (1997) 5 SCC 
536 at para 77. 
22. 
This Court in Mafatlal's case was faced with whether Kanhaiya Lal 
Mukundlal Sarafs case, 1959 SCR 1350, has been correctly decided in so 
far as it said that where taxes are paid under a mistake of law, the person 
paying is entitled to recover from the State such taxes on establishing the 
mistake and that this consequence flows from Section 72 of the Contract Act. 
In answering this question, this Court made an observation that so long as an 
appeal is provided to the Supreme Court from the orders of the appellate 
tribunal, the Act would be constitutionally valid. This Court while deciding 
whether Saraf's case was correctly decided or not, was not faced with the 
present question at all. Further, at the time that Mafatlal's case was decided, 
the scheme contained in the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944, required the 
High Court on a statement of case made to it to decide a question of law 
253 
Page 253 
arising out of the order of the appellate tribunal, after which the High Court is 
to deliver its judgment and send it back to the appellate tribunal which will 
then make such orders as are necessary to dispose of the case in conformity 
with such judgment. The then statutory scheme of the Central Excise and 
Salt Act, 1944 is contained in Sections 35G to 35L. 
"35G Statement of case to High Court 
(I) The Collector of Central Excise or the other party may;  
within sixty days of the date upon which he is served with 
notice of an order under section 35C (not being an order 
relating, among other things, to the determination of any 
question having a relation to the rate of duty of excise or to the 
value of goods for purposes of assessment), by application in 
the prescribed form, accompanied, where the application is 
made by the other party, by a fee of two hundred rupees, 
require the Appellate Tribunal to refer to the High Court any 
question of law arising out of such order and, subject to the 
other provisions contained in this section, the Appellate 
Tribunal shall, within one hundred and twenty days of the 
receipt of such application, draw up a statement of the case and 
refer it to the High Court: 
Provided that the Appellate Tribunal may, if it is satisfied that 
the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from presenting 
the application within the period hereinbefore specified, allow 
it to be presented within a further period not exceeding thirty 
days. 
(2) On receipt of notice that an application has been made 
under sub- section (If the person against whom such 
application has been made, may, notwithstanding that he may 
not have filed such an application, ,file, within forty- five days 
of the receipt of the notice, a memorandum of cross- objections 
verified in the prescribed manner against any part of the order 
in relation to which an application for reference has been made 
and such memorandum shall be disposed of by the Appellate 
Tribunal as V it were an application presented within the time 
specified in sub- section (If 
254 
Page 254 
.355 
 
(3) If on an application made under sub- section (1), the 
Appellate Tribunal refuses to state the case on the ground that 
no question of law arises, the Collector of Central Excise, or, 
as the case may be, the other party may, within six months from 
the date on which he is served with notice of such refusal, apply 
to the High Court and the High Court may, if it is not satisfied 
with the correctness of the decision of the Appellate Tribunal, 
require the Appellate Tribunal to state the case and to refer it, 
and on receipt of any such requisition, the Appellate Tribunal 
shall state the case and refer it accordingly 
(4) Where in the exercise of its powers under sub- section (3), 
the Appellate Tribunal refuses to state a case which it has been 
required by an applicant to state, the applicant may, within 
thirty days from the date on which he receives notice of such 
refusal, withdraw his application and, if he does so, the fee, if 
any, paid by him shall be refunded. 
35H. Statement of case to Supreme court in certain cases. If on 
an application made under section 35G, the Appellate Tribunal 
is of opinion that, on account of conflict in the decisions of 
High Courts in respect of any particular question of law, it is 
expedient that a reference should be made direct to the 
Supreme Court, the Appellate Tribunal may draw up a 
statement of the case and refer it through the President direct 
to the Supreme Court. 
351 Power of High Court or Supreme Court to require 
statement to be amended If the High Court or the Supreme 
Court is not satisfied that the statements in a case referred to it 
are sufficient to enable it to determine the questions raised 
thereby, the Court may refer the case back to the Appellate 
Tribunal, for the purpose of making such additions thereto or 
alterations therein as it may direct in that behalf 
351 Case before High Court to be heard by not less than two 
Judges. 
(1) When any case has been referred to the High Court under 
section 35G, it shall be heard by a Bench of not less than two 
Judges of the High Court and shall be decided in accordance 
with the opinion of such Judges or of the majority, if any, of 
such Judges. 
(2) Where there is no such majority, the Judges shall state the 
point of law upon which they differ and the case shall then be 
255 
Page 255 
-55t  
heard upon that point only by one or more of the other Judges 
of the High Colin, and such point shall be decided according to 
the opinion of the majority of the Judges who have heard the 
case including those who first heard it 
35K Decision of High Court or Supreme Court on the case 
stated 
(I) The High Court or the Supreme Court hearing any such 
case shall decide the questions of law raised therein and shall 
deliver its judgment thereon containing the grounds on which 
such decision is founded and a copy of the judgment shall be 
sent under the seal of the Court and the signature of the 
Registrar to the Appellate Tribunal which shall pass such 
orders as are necessary to dispose of the case in conformity 
with such judgment 
(2) The costs of any reference to the High Court or the Supreme 
Court which shall not include the fee for making the reference 
shall be in the discretion of the Court. 
35L Appeal to Supreme Court. An appeal shall lie to the 
Supreme Court from- 
(a) any judgment of the High Court delivered on a reference 
made under section 35G in any case which, on its own motion 
or on an oral application made by or on behalf of the party 
aggrieved immediately after the passing of the judgment, the 
High Court certifies to be a fit one for appeal to the Supreme 
Court; or 
(b) any order passed by the Appellate Tribunal relating among 
other things, to the determination of any question having a 
relation to the rate of duty of excise or to the value of goods for 
purposes of assessment." 
23. It is obvious that the decision of the nine Judge Bench was only 
referring to decisions of the appellate tribunal falling under sub-clause (b) of 
Section 35L relating to orders passed by the Appellate Tribunal on questions 
having a relation to the rate of duty of excise or value of goods for the 
purpose of assessment and not to appeals from judgments of the High Court 
256 
Page 256 
delivered on a reference under Section 35G after the High Court had decided 
on a question of law. It is clear, therefore, that the context of Mafatlal's 
decision was completely different and the decision did not advert to Sections 
35G to 35L as they then stood. 
24. 
Art. 323B was part of the constitution 42' Amendment Act which was, 
as is well lmottm, an amendment which was rushed through during the 1975 
emergency. Many of its features were undone by the constimtion 44th  
Amendment Act passed a couple of years later. One of the interesting 
features that was undone was the amendment to Art. 227. 
The 42' Amendment substituted the following clause for clause (1) of 
Art. 227: 
"(I) Every High Court shall have superintendence over 
all courts subject to its appellate jurisdiction." 
25. 
A cursory reading of the substituted clause shows that the old section 
107 of the Government of India Act 1915 was brought back: Tribunals were 
no longer subject to the High Courts' superintendence, and subordinate 
courts were only subject to the High Courts' superintendence, if they were 
also subject to its appellate jurisdiction. As stated above, the 442 Amendment 
undid this and restored sub-clause (1) to its original position. 
26. 
However, Art. 323B continues as part of the constitution. The real 
reason for the insertion of the said article was the same as the amendment 
257 
Page 257 
made to Art. 227 — the removal of the High Courts' supervisory jurisdiction 
over tribunals. L. Chandra Kumar v.Union of India (1997) 3 SCC 261, 
undid the very raison d'etre of Article 323B by restoring the supervisory 
jurisdiction of the High Courts so that a reference to Article 323B would no 
longer be necessary as the legislative competence to make a law relating to 
tribunals would in any case be traceable to Entries 77 to79, 95 of List I, Entry 
65 of List II and Entry 11A and 46 of List III of the 7th Schedule to the 
Constitution of India. 
27. In a significant statement of the law, Chandra Kumar's judgment, in 
upholding the vesting of the High Court's original jurisdiction in a Central 
Administrative Tribunal, stated thus: 
"The legitimacy of the power of Courts within constitutional 
democracies to review legislative action has been questioned 
since the time it was first conceived The Constitution of India, 
being alive to such criticism, has, while conferring such power 
upon the higher judiciary, incorporated important safeguards. 
An analysis of the manner in which the Framers of our 
Constitution incorporated provisions relating to the judiciary 
would indicate that they were very greatly concerned with 
securing the independence of the judiciary. These attempts 
were directed at ensuring that the judiciary would be capable 
of effectively discharging its wide powers of judicial review. 
While the Constitution confers the power to strike down laws 
upon the High Courts and the Supreme Court it also contains 
elaborate provisions dealing with the tenure, salaries, 
allowances, retirement age of Judges as well as the mechanism 
for selecting Judges to the superior Courts. The inclusion of 
such elaborate provisions appears to have been occasioned by 
258 
Page 258 
the belief than armed by such provisions, the superior courts 
would be insulated from any executive or legislative attempts to 
interfere with the making of their decisions. The Judges of the 
superior courts have been entrusted with the task of upholding 
the Constitution and to this end, have been conferred the power 
to interpret it. It is they who have to ensure that the balance of 
power envisaged by the Constitution is maintained and that the 
legislature and the executive do not, in the discharge of their 
functions, transgress constitutional limitations. It is eauallv 
thilW)
lu  to ofersee that the judicial decisions rendered by 
those who man the subordinate courts and tribunals do not fall 
• ul o strict standards o le al correctness and 'udicial 
independence. The constitutional safeguards which ensure the 
independence of the Judges of the superior judiciary, are not 
available to the Judges of the subordinate judiciary or to those 
who man Tribunals created by ordinary legislations. 
Consequently, Judges of the latter category can never be 
considered full and effective substitutes for the superior 
judiciary in discharging the function of constitutional 
interpretation., We, therefore, hold that the power of judicial 
review over legislative action vested in the High Courts under 
Articles 226 and in this Court under Article 32 of the 
Constitution is an integral and essential feature of the 
Constitution, constituting part of its basic structure. Ordinarily, 
therefore, the power of High Courts and the Supreme Court to 
test the constitutional validity of legislations can never be 
ousted or excluded. (See Para 78) 
W also hold that the power vested in the Hish Courts to  
exercise iudicial superintendence over the decisions of all 
Courts and Tribunals within their respective jurisdictions is 
also part of the basic structure of the Constitution. This is  
because a situation where the High Courts are divested of all  
other judicial functions apart from that of constitutional 
interpretation is eauallv to be avoided  (See Para 79) 
Before moving on to other aspects, we may summarise our 
conclusions on the jurisdictional powers of these Tribunals. 
The Tribunals are competent to hear matters where the vires of 
statutory provisions are questioned However in discharginn 
259 
Page 259 
this duty they cannot act as substitutes for the High Courts and 
the Supreme Court which have under our constitutional set-up  
been specifically entrusted with such an oblieation Their 
function in this respect is only supplementary and all such 
decisions of the Tribunals will be subject to scrutiny before a 
Division Bench of the respective High Courts. "(see Para 93) 
28. The stage is now set for the Attorney General's reliance on Union of 
India v. R. Gandhi (2010) 11 SCC 1. 
Various provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 were under challenge 
before the Constitution Bench. The effect of these provisions was to replace 
the Company Law Board by a Tribunal vested with original jurisdiction, and 
to replace the High Court in First Appeal with an appellate tribunal. After 
noticing the difference between courts and tribunals hn paras 38 and 45, the 
court referred to the independence of the judiciary and to the separation of 
powers doctrine, as understood in the Indian Constitutional Context in paras 
46 to 57. In a significant statement of the law, the Constitution Bench said: 
"The Constitution contemplates judicial power being exercised 
by both courts and tribunals. Except the powers and 
jurisdiction vested in superior courts by the Constitution  
powers and jurisdiction of courts are controlled and regulated 
by legislative enactments. The High Courts are vested with the 
jurisdiction to entertain and hear appeals, revisions and 
references in pursuance of provisions contained in several 
specific legislative enactments. If jurisdiction of High Courts 
can be created by providing for appeals, revisions and 
references to be heard by the High Courts, jurisdiction can also 
be taken away by deleting the provisions for appeals, revisions 
or references. It also follows that the legislature has the power 
to create Tribunals with reference to specific enactments and 
260 
Page 262 
confer jurisdiction on them to decide disputes in regard to 
matters arising from such special enactments. Therefore it 
cannot be said that legislature has no power to transfer judicial 
functions traditionally performed by courts to Tribunals." 
(para 87) 
In another significant paragraph, the Constitution bench stated: 
"But when we say that the legislature has the competence to 
make laws, providing which disputes will be decided by courts, 
and which disputes will be decided by tribunals, it is subject to 
constitutional limitations, without encroaching upon the  
independence of the judiciary and keeping in view the 
principles of the rule of law and separation of rowers. If 
tribunals are to be vested with judicial power hitherto vested in 
or exercised by courts, such tribunals should possess the 
independence, security and capacity associated with courts. If 
the tribunals are intended to serve an area which requires 
specialized knowledge or expertise, no doubt there can be 
technical members in addition to judicial members. Where 
however jurisdiction to try certain category of cases are 
transferred from courts to tribunals only to expedite the 
hearing and disposal or relieve from the rigours of the 
Evidence Act and procedural laws, there is obviously no need 
to have any non-judicial technical member. In respect of such 
tribunals, only members of the judiciary should be the 
Presiding Officers/Members. Typical examples of such special 
tribunals are Rent Tribunals, Motor Accidents Claims 
Tribunals and Special Courts under several enactments. 
Therefore, when transferring the jurisdiction exercised by 
courts to tribunals, which does not involve any specialized 
knowledge or expertise in any field and expediting the disposal 
and relaxing the procedure is the only object, a provision for 
technical members in addition to or in substitution of judicial 
members would clearly be a case of dilution of and 
encroachment upon the independence of the judiciary and the 
rule of law and would be unconstitutional. "(at para 90) 
The Bench then went on to hold that only certain areas of litigation can 
be transferred from courts to tribunals. (see para 92) 
261 
Page 261 
r 
 3 I202 
In paragraphs 101 and 102 the law is stated thus: 
"Independent judicial tribunals for determination of the 
rights of citizens, and for adjudication of the disputes and 
complaints of the citizens, is a necessary concomitant of the 
rule of law. The rule of law has several facets one of which is 
that disputes of citizens will be decided by Judges who are 
inde ndent and im argot -  and that dis uses as t 
he Gayer 	
ill be d ddb Jud 
inclendeti
e. Another facet of the rule of law is 
equality before law The essence of the equality is that it must 
be capable of being enforced and adjudicated by an 
independent judicial forum. 	
Judicial independence and 
separation of judicial power from the executive are part of the 
common law traditions implicit in a Constitution like ours 
which is based on the Westminster model 
The fundamental right to equality before law and equal 
protection of laws guaranteed by Art.14 of the Constitution, 
clearly includes a right to have the person's rights. adjudicated 
by a forum which exercises judicial power in an impartial and 
independent manner. consistent with the recognized principles 
of adjudication. Therefore wherever access to courts to enforce 
such rights is sought to be abridged, altered, modified or 
substituted by directing him to approach an alternative forum, 
such legislative act is open to challenge i f it violates the right to 
adjudication by an independent forum. Therefore, though the 
challenge by MBA is on the ground of violation of principles 
forming part of the basic structure, they are relatable to one of 
more of the express provisions of the Constitution which gave 
rise to such principles. Though the validity of the provisions of 
a legislative act cannot be challenged on the ground it violates 
the basic structure of the Constitution, it can be challenged as 
violative of constitutional provisions which enshrine • the 
principles of the rule of law. separation of powers and 
independence of the judiciary." 
29. Gandhi's case dealt with one specialized tribunal replacing another 
specialized tribunal (The Company Law Board) at the original stage. It is 
significant to note that the first appeal provided to the appellate tribunal is not 
262 
Page 262 
3 63 -- 
restricted only to questions of law. It is a full first appeal as understood in the 
section 96 CPC sense — (See section 10FQ of the Companies Act). A further 
appeal is provided to the Supreme Court under Section 10GF only on 
questions of law. When Gandhi's case states in paragraph 87 that the 
jurisdiction of the High Courts can be taken away by deleting provisions for 
appeals, revisions or references, and that these functions traditionally 
performed by courts can be transferred to tribunals, the court was only 
dealing with the situation of the High Court being supplanted at the original 
and first appellate stage so far as the company 'jurisdiction' is concerned in a 
situation where questions of fact have to be determined afresh at the first 
appellate stage as well. These observations obviously cannot be logically 
extended to cover a situation like the present where the High Court is being 
supplanted by a tribunal which would be deciding only substantial questions 
of law. 
30. The present case differs from Gandhi's case in a very fundamental 
manner. The National Tax Tribunal which replaces the High Courts in the 
country replaces them only to decide substantial questions of law which 
relate to taxation. In fact, a Direct Tax Laws Committee delivered a report in 
1978 called the Choksi Committee after its Chairman. This report had in fact 
recommended that a Central Tax Court should be set up. The report stated: 
263 
Page 263 
364 
UI-6.10. In paragraph 11.30 of our Interim Report, we had 
expressed the view that the Government should consider the 
establishment of a Central Tax Court to deal with all matters 
arising under the Income-tax Act and other Central Tax Laws, 
and had left the matter for consideration in greater detail in 
our Final Report. We have since examined the matter from all 
aspects. 
11-6.11. The problem of tax litigation in India has assumed 
staggering proportions in recent years. From the statistics 
supplied to us, it is seen that, as on 30th  June, 1977, there were 
as many as 10,500 references under the direct tax laws pending 
with the various High Courts, the largest pendency being in 
Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh. 
The number of references made to the High Courts in India 
under all the tax laws is of the order of about 3,300 in a year, 
whereas the annual disposals of such references by all the High 
Courts put together amount to about 600 in a year In addition 
to these references, about 750 writ petitions on tax matters are 
also filed before the High Courts every year. Under the existing 
practice of each High Court having only a single bench for 
dealing with the tax matters and that too not all round the year, 
there is obviously no likelihood of the problem being brought 
down to manageable proportions at any time in, the future, but, 
on the other hand, it is likely to become worse. Even writ 
petitions seeking urgent remedy against executive action take 
several years for disposal. The Wanchoo Committee, which 
had considered this problem, recommended the creation of 
permanent Tax Benches in High Courts and appointment of 
retired Judges to such Benches under Article 224A of the 
Constitution to clear the backlog. Although more than 6 years 
have passed since that recommendation was made, the position 
of arrears in tax matters has shown no improvement but, on the 
other hand, it has worsened In this connection, it would be 
worth noting that the Wanchoo Committee considered an 
alternative course for dealing with this problem through the 
establishment of a Tax Court but they desistedfrom making any 
recommendation to that effect us, in their opinion, that would 
involve extensive amendments to law and procedures. We have 
directed our attention to this matter in the context of the 
mounting arrears of tax cases before the courts. 
264 
Page 264 
I
.I
11-6. 12. The pendency of cases before the courts in tax matters 
has also a snow-balling effect all along the line of appellate 
hierarchies inasmuch as proceedings in hundreds of cases are 
initiated and kept pending, awaiting the law to be finally settled 
by the Supreme Court after prolonged litigation in some other 
cases. This obviously adds considerably to the load of 
injductuous word in the Department and clutters up the files of 
appellate authorities at all levels, with adverse consequences 
on their efficiency. According to the figures supplied to us, out 
of tax arrears amounting to Rs. 98653 crores as on 31" 
December, 1977, Rs.293.26 crores (30 per cent) were disputed 
in proceedings before various appellate authorities and courts. 
11-6.13. 	
Apart from the delays which are inherent in the 
existing system, the jurisdiction pattern of the High Courts also 
seems to contribute to the generation of avoidable work At 
present, High Courts are obliged to hear references on matters 
falling within their jurisdiction notwithstanding that references 
on identical points have been decided by other High Courts. 
The decision of one High Court is not binding on another High 
Court even on identical issues. Finality is reached only when 
the Supreme Court decides the issue which may take 10 to 15 
years. 
II-614. Tax litigation is currently handled by different 
Benches of the High Courts constituted on an ad hoc basis. 
The absence of permanent benches also accounts for the delay 
in the disposal of the tax cases by High Courts. 
11-6.15. 	
The answer to these problems, in our view, is the 
establishment of a Central 	
Tax Court with all-India 
jurisdiction to deal with such litigation to the exclusion of High 
Courts. Such a step will have several advantages. In the first 
place, it would lead to uniformity in decisions and bring a 
measure of certainty in tax matters. References involving 
common issues can be conveniently consolidated and disposed 
of together, thereby accelerating the pace of disposal. Better 
co-ordination among the benches would make for speedy 
disposal of cases and reduce the scope for proliferation of 
appeals on the same issues before the lower appellate 
authorities, which in its turn will reduce the volume of 
litigation going up before the Tax Court as well. Once a 
Central Tad Court is established, the judges appointed to the 
265 
Page 265 
3.46 ---- 
Benches thereof will develop the requisite expertise by 
continuous working in this field. This would facilitate quicker 
disposal of tax matters and would also help in reducing 
litigation by ensuring uniformity in decisions. 
11-616. 	
In the light of the foregoing discussions, we 
recommend that the Government should take steps for this 
early establishment of a Central Tax Court with all-India 
jurisdiction to deal exclusively with litigation under the direct 
Tax laws in the first instance, with provisions for extending its 
jurisdiction to cover all other Central Tax laws, if considered 
necessary in the future. We suggest that such a court should be 
constituted under a separate statute. As the implementation of 
this recommendation may necessitate amendment of the 
constitution, which is likely to take time, we further recommend 
that Government may in the meanwhile, consider the 
desirability of constituting special Tax benches in the High 
Courts to deal with the large number of Tax cases by 
continuously sitting throughout the year. The Judges to be 
appointed to these special benches may be selected from among 
those, who have special knowledge and experience in dealing 
with matters relating to direct Tax laws so that when the 
Central Tax Court is established at a later date, these judges 
could be transferred to that Court. 
11-617. 	
The Central Tax Court should have Benches 
located at important centres. To start with it may have Benches 
at the following seven places, viz., Ahmedabad, Bombay 
Calcutta, Delhi, Kanpur, Madras and Nagpur. Each Bench 
should consist of two judges. Highly qualified persons should 
be appointed as judges of the Central Tax Court, from among 
persons who are High Court judges or who are eligible to be 
appointed as High Court judges. In the matter of conditions of 
service, scales or pay and other privileges, judges of the 
Central Tax Court should be on par with the High Court 
judges. 
11-6.18. The Supreme Court and, following it the High Courts 
have held that the Tribunal and the tax authorities, being 
creatures of the Act cannot pronounce on the constitutional 
validity or vires of any provision of the Act; that; therefore, 
such a question cannot arise out of the order of the Tribunal 
and cannot be made the subject matter of a reference to the 
266 
Page 266 
3 7 - 
High Court and a subsequent appeal to the Supreme court; and 
that such a question of validity or vires can be raised only in a 
suit or a writ petition. While an income-tax authority or the 
Tribunal cannot decide upon the validity or vires of the other 
provisions of the law. We recommend that the powers of the 
Central Tax Court in this regard should be clarified in the law 
itself by specifically giving it the right to go into questions of 
validity of the provisions of the Tax Laws or of the rules framed 
thereunder. 
II-619. Another important matter, in which we consider that 
the present position needs improvement, is the nature of the 
Court's jurisdiction in tax matters. Under the present law, the 
High Court's jurisdiction in such matters is merely advisory on 
questions allow. For this purpose, the Appellate Tribunal has 
to draw up a statement of the case and refer the same to the 
High Court for its opinion. After the High Court delivers its 
judgment on the reference, the matter goes back to the 
Tribunal, which has then to pass such orders as are necessary 
to dispose of the case conformably to such judgment. Under 
this procedure, the aggrieved party before the Tribunal has to 
file an application seeking a reference to the High Court on 
specified questions of law arising out of the Tribunal's order 
The hearing of such application by the Tribunal, followed by 
the drawing up of the statement of the case to the High Court, 
delays the consideration of the issue by the High Court for a 
considerable time. Where the Tribunal refuses to state the case 
as sought by the applicant then again, the law provides for a 
direct approach to the High Court for issue of directions to the 
Appellate Tribunal to state the case to the High Court on the 
relevant question of law. This process also delays the 
consideration of the matter by the High court for quite some 
time. In addition to these types of delay, there will be further 
delays after the High Court decides the matter, as the Tribunal 
has to pass consequential orders disposing of the case, before 
the relief, if any due, can be granted to the assessee. 
II-6.20. 	
In our view, the disposal of tax litigation can be 
speeded up considerably by vesting jurisdiction in the proposed 
Central Tax Court to hear appeals against the orders of the 
Tribunal on questions of law arising out of such orders. We, 
accordingly, recommend that the jurisdiction of the Central 
267 
Page 267 
3i, 
Tax Court should be Appellate and not advisory. We also 
recommend that appeals before the Central Tax Court should 
be heard by a Bench of two judges. The judgment of a division 
Bench should be binding on other division Benches of the Tax 
Court unless it is contrary to a decision of the Supreme Court 
or of a full Bench of the Tax Court. 
11-6.2 I 	
In the matter of appeals before the Central Tax 
Court. it would be necessary to make a special provision for 
enabling Chartered Accountants to appear on behalf of 
appellants or respondents to argue the appeals before it Legal 
practitioners would, in any event be entitled to appear before 
the Central Tax Court In addition, any other person, who may 
be permitted by the Court to appear before it, may also 
represent the appellant or the respondent in tax matters. 
11-6.22. 	
Our recommendation for setting up of a Central 
Tax Court may not be interpreted to be only a modified version 
of the concept of administrative and other tribunals authorized 
to be set up for various purposes under the amendments 
effected by the 42'd  Amendment of the Constitution. The 
Central Tax Court, which we have in view, will be a special 
kind of High court with functional jurisdiction over tax matters 
and enjoying judicial independence in the same manner as the 
High Courts. 	
The controversy generated by the 42nd  
Amendment to the Constitution should not, therefore, be held to 
militate against the proposal for the establishment of a Central 
Tax Court to exercise the functions of a High Court in tax 
matters." 
This recommendation was not acceded to by Parliament. 
31. 	
It is obvious, that substantial questions of law which relate to 	
taxation 
would also involve many areas of civil and criminal law, for example Hindu 
Joint Family Law, partnership, sale of goods, contracts, Mohammedan Law, 
Company Law, Law relating to Trusts and Societies, Transfer of Properrs.,, 
Law relating to Intellectual Property, Interpretation of Statutes and sections 
dealing with prosecution for offences. It is therefore not correct to say that 
268 
Page 268 
-- 1 
taxation, being a specialized subject, can be dealt with by a tribunal All 
substantial questions of law have under our constitutional scheme to be 
decided by the superior courts and the superior courts alone. Indeed, one of 
the objects for enacting the National Tax Tribunals Act, as stated by the 
Minister on the floor of the House, is that the National Tax Tribunal can lay 
down the law for the whole of India which then would bind all other 
authorities and tribunals. This is a direct encroachment on the High Courts' 
power under Art. 227 to decide substantial questions of law which would 
bind all tribunals vide East India Commercial Co. case, supra. 
32. 	
In fact, it is a little surprising that the National Tax Tribunal is 
interposed between the appellate Tribunal and the Supreme Court for the 
very good reason that ultimately it will only be the Supreme Court that will 
declare the law to be followed in future. As the appellate tribunal is already a 
second appellate court, it would be wholly unnecessary to have a National 
Tax Tribunal decide substantial questions of law in case of conflicting 
decisions of High Courts and Appellate Tribunals as these would ultimately 
be decided by the Supreme Court itself, which decision would under Article 
141 be binding on all tax authorities and tribunals. Secondly, in all tax 
matters, the State is invariably a party and the High Court is ideally situated 
to decide substantial questions of law which arise between the State and 
269 
Page 269 
-37° 
private persons, being constitutionally completely independent of executive 
control. The same cannot be said of tribunals which, as L. Chandra Kumar 
states, will have to be under a nodal ministry as tribunals are not under the 
supervisory jurisdiction of the High Courts. 
33. Indeed, other constitutions which are based on the Westminster model, 
like the British North America Act which governs Canada have held 
likewise. In Attorney General for Quebec v. Farrah (1978) Vol.86 DLR 
[3d] 161 a transport tribunal was given appellate jurisdiction over the Quebec 
Transport Commission. The tribunal performed no function other than 
deciding questions of law. Since this function was ultimately performed only 
by superior courts, the impugned section was held to be unconstitutional. 
This judgment was followed in Re. Residential Tenancies Act, 123 DLR 
(3d) 554. This judgment went further, and struck down the Residential 
Tenancy Act which established a tribunal to require landlords and tenants to 
comply with the obligations imposed under the Act. The court held: 
The Court of Appeal delivered a careful and scholarly 
unanimous judgment in which each of these questions was 
answered in the negative. The Court concluded it was not 
within the legislative authority of Ontario to empower the 
Residential Tenancy Commission to make eviction orders and 
compliance orders as provided in the Residential Tenancies 
Act, 1979 The importance of the issue is reflected in the fact 
that five Judges of the Court, including the Chief Justice and 
Associate Chief Justice,sat on the appeal. " 
270 
Page 270 
37/- 
it then went on to enunciate a three steps test with which we are not 
directly concerned. The Court finally concluded: 
"Implicit throughout the argument advanced on behalf of the 
Attorney-General of Qntario is the assumption that the Court 
system is too cumbersome, too expensive and therefore unable 
to respond properly to the social needs which the residential 
Tenancies Act, 1979 is intended to meet. All statutes respond 
to social needs. The Courts are unfamiliar with equity and the 
concept of fairness, justice, convenience, reasonableness. 
Since the enactment in1976 of the legislation assuring 
"security of tenure' the Country Court Judges of Ontario have 
been dealing with matters arising out of that legislation, 
apparently with reasonable dispatch, as both landlords and 
tenants in the present proceedings have spoken clearly against 
transfer of jurisdiction in respect of eviction and compliance 
orders from the Courts to a special commission. It is perhaps 
also of interest that there is no suggestion in the material filed 
with us that the Law Reforms Commission favoured removal 
from the Courts of the historic functions performed for over 
100 years by the Courts. 
I am neither unaware of nor unsympathetic to, the 
arguments advanced in support of a view that s96 should not 
be interpreted so as to thwart or unduly restrict the future 
growth of provincial administrative tribunals. Yet, however 
worthy the policy objectives, must be recognized that we, as a 
Court, are not given the freedom to choose whether the 
problem is such that provincial, rather than federal, authority 
should deal with it. We must seek to give effect to the 
Constitution as we understand it and with due regard for the 
manner in which it has been judicially interpreted in the past. 
If the impugned power is violative of s96 it must be struck 
down." 
34. In Hins v. The Queen Director of Public Prosecutions v Jackson 
Attorney General of Jamaica (intervener) 1976 (1) All ER 353, the Privy 
Council had to decide a matter under the Jamaican Constitution. A Gun 
271 
Page 271 
Courts Act, 1974 was passed by the Jamaican Parliament in which it set up 
various courts. A question similar to the question posed in the instant case 
was decided thus: 
"All constitutions on the Westminister model deal under 
separate chapter heading with the legislature, the executive 
and the judicature. The chapter dealing with the judicature 
invariably contains provisions dealing with the method of 
appointment and security of tenure of the members of the 
judiciary which are designed to assure to them a degree of 
independence from the other two branches of government It 
may, as in the case of Constitution of Ceylon, contain nothing 
more. To the extent to which the constitution itself is silent as 
to the distribution of the plenitude of judicial power between 
various courts it is implicit that it shall continue to be 
distributed between and exercised by the courts that were 
already in existence when the new constitution came into force; 
but the legislature, in exercise of its power to make laws for the 
peace, order and good government of the state, may provide 
for the establishment of new courts and for the transfer to them 
of the whole or part of the jurisdiction previously exercisable 
by an existing court What, however, is implicit in the very 
structure of a constitution on the Westminister model is that 
judicial power, however it be distributed from time to time 
between various courts, is to continue to be vested in persons 
appointed to hold judicial office in the manner and on the terms 
laid down in the chapter dealing with the judicature, even 
though this not expressly stated in the constitution (Liyanage v. 
R [19661 All ER 650 at 658 [19761 AC 259 at 287, 288] 
The morerecent constitutions on the Westminister 
model, unlike their earlier prototypes, include a chapter 
dealing with fundamental rights and freedoms. The provisions 
of this chapter form part of the substantive law of the state and 
until amended by whatever special procedure is laid down in 
the constitution for this purpose, impose a fetter on the exercise 
by the legislature, the executive and the judiciary of the 
plenitude of their respective powers. The remaining chapters 
of the constitutions are primarily concerned not with the 
272 
Page 272 
,-373 
legislature, the executive and the judicatures as abstractions, 
but with the persons who shall be entitled collectively or 
individually to exercise the plenitude of legislative, executive or 
judicial powers — their qualifications for legislative, executive 
or judicial office, the method of selecting them, their tenure of 
office, the procedure to be followed where powers are 
conferred on a class of persons acting collectively and the 
majorities required for the exercise of these powers. Thus, 
where a constitution on the Westminister model speaks of a 
particular 'court' already in existence when the constitution 
comes into force, it uses this expression as a collective 
description of all those individual judges who, whether sitting 
alone or with other judges or with a jury, are entitled to 
exercise the jurisdiction exercised by that court before the 
constitution came into force. Any express provision in the 
constitution for the appointment or security of tenure of judges 
of that court will apply to all individual judges subsequently 
appointed to exercise an analogous jurisdiction, whatever other 
name may be given to the 'court' in which they sit (Attorney 
General for Ontario v. attorney General for Canada.) 
Where, under a constitution on the Westminister model, 
a law is made by the parliament which purports to confer 
jurisdiction on a court described by a new name, the question 
whether the law conflicts with the provisions of the constitution 
dealing with the exercise of the judicial power does not depend 
on the label (in the instant case 'The Gun Court) which the 
parliament attaches to the judges when exercising the 
jurisdiction conferred on them by the law whose 
constitutionality is impugned. It is the substance of the law that 
must be regarded, not the form. What is the nature of the 
jurisdiction to be exercised by the judges who are to compose 
the court to which the new label is attached? Does the method 
of their appointment and the security of their tenure conform to 
the requirements of the constitution applicable to judges who, 
at the time the constitution came into force, exercised 
jurisdiction of that nature? (Attorney General for Australia v. R 
and Boilermakers' Society of Australia)." 
273 
Page 273 
35. 
Ultimately, a majority of the court found that the provisions of the 
1974 Act, in so far as they provide for the establishment of a full court 
division of the Gun Court consisting of three resident Magistrates were 
unconstitutional. 
36. 
it was also argued by the learned Attorney General that the High 
Courts' jurisdiction under Section 260A of the Income Tax Act and other 
similar tax laws could be taken away by ordinary law and such sections could 
be deleted. If that is so surely the jurisdiction vested in the High Court by the 
said section can be transferred to another body. 
37. 
It is well settled that an appeal is a creature of statute and can be done 
away by statute. The question posed here is completely different and the 
answer to tha: question is fundamental to our jurisprudence: that a 
jurisdiction to decide substantial questions of law vests under our 
constitution, only with the High Courts and the Supreme Court, and cannot 
be vested in any other body as a core constitutional value would be impaired 
thereby. 
38. 
In fact, the Attorney General in his written argument at pains 16 and 
21(a) has stated before us: 
"16. It is submitted that the present Act does not take away the 
power of judicial superintendence of the High Court under 
Article 227. Direct appeal to the Supreme Court from the 
decisions of a tribunal offirst instance is an acceptable form of 
274 
Page 274 
37I- 
judicial scrutiny. Provision for direct appeal to Supreme Court 
from the decision of a tribunal can be purely on questions of 
law as well Since the High Court as a rule does not exercise its 
power ofjudicial superintendence when an appeal is provided 
to the Supreme Court, the power of judicial superintendence of 
the High Court over the tribunal stands curtailed in such cases 
as well But this curtailment does not violate the rule of law as 
a court of law Le. the Supreme Court continues to be the final 
interpreter of the law. By the same analogy a decision of an 
appellate tribunal with unrestricted right of appeal to the 
Supreme Court will not curtail the power of High Court under 
227 as recourse to the High Court under Articles 226/227 
would still be available if the tribunal exceeds its jurisdiction 
or violates the principles of natural justice or commits such 
other transgressions. 
21. (a) The present Act provides ample scope for judicial 
scrutiny in the form of an Appeal under Section 24 of the Act 
and also under Articles 226/227, Article 32 and Article 136 of 
the Constitution. " 
39. On reading the above argument, it is clear that even according to this 
argument, the High Court's power of judicial review under Articles 226/227 
has in fact been supplanted by the National Tax Tribunal, something which 
L. Chandrakumar said cannot be done. See Para 93 of L. Chandra Kumar's 
case quoted above. In State of West Bengal v. Committee for Protection of 
Democratic Rights, 2010 (3) SCC 571, a Constitution Bench of this Court 
held: 
"39. It is trite that in the constitutional scheme adopted in 
India, besides supremacy of the Constitution, the separation of 
powers between the legislature, the executive and the judiciary 
constitutes the basic features of the Constitution. In fact, the 
importance of separation of powers in our system of 
governance was recognised in Special Reference No. I of 
275 
Page 275 
1964 [AIR 1965 SC 745 : (1965) 1 SCR 413], even before the 
basic structure doctrine came to be propounded in the 
celebrated case of Kesavananda Bharati s State of 
Kerala [(1973) 4 SCC 225] , -wherein while finding certain 
basic features of the Constitution, it was opined that separation 
of powers is part of the basic structure of the Constitution. 
Later, similar view was echoed in Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj 
Narain [1975 Supp SCC I] and in a series of other cases on the 
point Nevertheless, apart from the fact that our Constitution 
does not envisage a rigid and strict separation of powers 
between the said three organs of the State, the power ofjudicial 
review stands entirely on a different pedestal. Being itself part 
of the basic structure of the Constitution, it cannot be ousted or 
abridged by even a constitutional amendment. (See L. Chandra 
Kumar v. Union of India [(1997) 3 SCC 261 : 1997 SCC (L&S) 
577] ) Besides, judicial review is otherwise essential for 
resolving the disputes regarding the limits of constitutional 
power and entering the constitutional limitations as an ultimate 
interpreter of the Constitution." 
"68. Thus, having examined the rival contentions in the context 
of the constitutional scheme, we conclude as follows: 
010 In view of the constitutional scheme and the jurisdiction 
conferred on this Court under Article 32 and on the High 
Courts under Article 226 of the Constitution the power of 
judicial review being an integral part of the basic structure of 
the Constitution, no Act of Parliament can exclude or curtail 
the powers of the constitutional courts with regard to the 
enforcement offundamental rights. As a matter of fact, such a 
power is essential to give practicable content to the objectives 
of the Constitution embodied in Part III and other parts of the 
Constitution. Moreover, in a federal constitution, the 
distribution of legislative powers between Parliament and the 
State Legislature involves limitation on legislative powers and 
therefore, this requires an authority other than Parliament to 
ascertain whether such limitations are transgressed. Judicial 
review acts as the final arbiter not only to give effect to the 
distribution of legislative powers between Parliament and the 
State Legislatures, it is also necessary to show any 
transgression by each entity. Therefore, to borrow the words of 
Lord Steyn, judicial review is justified by combination of "the 
276 
Page 276 
re377--  
principles of separation of powers, rule of law, the principle of 
constitutionality and the reach of judicial review." 
40. 
In Proprietary Articles Trades Association v. Attorney General for 
Canada, 1931 AC 311, Lord Atkin said: 
"Their Lordships entertain no doubt that time alone will not 
validate an Act which when challenged is found to be ultra 
vires; nor will a history of a gradual series of advances till this 
boundary is finally crossed avail to protect the ultimate 
encroachment." At Pg 317. 
41. 
Chandra Kumar and R. Gandhi have allowed tribunalization at the 
original stage subject to certain safeguards. The boundary has finally been 
crossed in this case. I would, therefore, hold that the National Tax Tribunals 
Act is unconstitutional, being the ultimate encroachment on the exclusive 
domain of the superior Courts of Record in India.

Article 60 
Mm Vice-President : The House will now take up for consideration article 60 of the 
Draft constitution. Mr. Ahmed Ibrahim may move amendment No. 1289. 
K. T. M. Ahmad Ibrahim Sahib Bahadur (Madras: Muslim) I have given notice of 
an amendment to this amendment. 
Mr. Vice-President: Yes, I received it just new. The honou ra die Member may move 
it. 
K. T. M. Ahmad Ibrahim Sahib Bahadur : S r, I move' 
That Pc proviso to clause 	
of at cle 6c be rie °tea." 
The ob(ect of my amendment is to preserve the executive powers of the States or 
Provinces at least in so far as the subjects which are included in tre Concurrent List. It 
has been painted out during the general discussion that the scheme of the Draft 
constitutor' is to whittle down the powers of the States considerably and, though the 
plan is said to be a federal ore, in actual fact It Is a unitary form of Government that is 
sought to be imposed on the country by the Draft Constitution. Members from all parties, 
irrespective of party affiliations, have condemned during the general discussion this 
aspect of the Draft Constitution. They have repeatedly shown that the Draft Constitution 
is in spirk a unitary form of Government and not a federal one. 
Now. Sir, even in the Lists of  Subjects drawn up and attached to the Constitution, a 
very large number of subjects which are usually in the Proyincia: List have beer 
transferred .to the Concurrent L:st and the Union Dst, with the result that we find only a 
small number of subjects included in the Provincial L:st. Artie 60 (1) (a) seeks to take 
away from the States the executive power even win regard to those few subjects which 
are included in the Concurrent List. This, Sir, will be depriving the States of a large 
portion cf even the little exec:el:lye power that will otherwise be left to them under this 
Draft Constitution. It may be saic that this has to be done for the sake of common 
interest, for uniformity, for defence and for emergencies. But I would point out that 
there is no necessity at all to take away even this limited power from the . 	
 
The Honourable Shri K. Santhanam : May I point out to the honourable Member 
that the deletion of the proviso to clause (1) will vest the entire executive power and 
ConCil Gent subjects at the Centre. 
K. T. M. Ahmad Ibrahim Sahib Bahadur 	
com ng to that. 
 
The Honourable shin K. Santhanam : May I point out to the honourable this 
proviso will be as stated by me. 
K. T. M. Ahmad Ibrahim Sahib Banana!' : I am coming to teat. I have g ven notice 
of another amendment to obviate that difficulty. It is to the effect that the Word 
'exclusive' be inserted in article 60 	
(a) between the words 'Pad lament has' and the 
word 'power'. The result of this will be that the executive power of the Union wili be 
confined only to those subjects tmita. reseect to which it has exclusive power to make 
laws. I think this would remove the doubt expressed by my honourable Friend The 
executive power under my amendment 	
 
333" 
The Honourable Shri K. Santhanam : Has the honourable Member the pmmission 
of the Chat to move th s amend met? 
K. T. hl. Ahmad Ibrahim Sahib Bahadur : The V cetPresident las been knt 
 
enough to permit me to move this amendment and in pursuance of that perm.ssion 
have moved the amendment: 
 
Shri L. Krishnasvvami Bharathi : How does it read no w7 
IC T. M. Ahmad Ibrahim Sahib Bahadur : It reads as follows:— 
C asscir` (a) to the raters with repot tO nhin Peri amen has exclusive power to rake aws 
Therefore the executive power of the Union sr a I not extend to matters w th wspect 
to which): has no exclusive power to make lees, e., matters Ind:iced in the Concurrent 
List. Sir, under the present Government of India Act we do not have any such provision.  
In page 6 of the letter of the Chairman of the Drafting Committee to the Honourable 
President of the Constituent Assembly, in paragraph 7, he points out- 
"us:lerCP %resent Cones:tor:On executse out 'Ors in respect of Chncurrerr List costae vests in :re rrovince 
91-13ect is ;terrain nutters to :he power 0' the Centre to gine direction:' 
He says `hen — 
.n ne Dn't Coos' rubor we Cerro ee hes repated slightly eo n this :Ian 
must point out, Sr, that it has not departed slightly from this plan but on the other 
hand the Drafting Committee has opened the floodgates to the Central Government to 
enable it to make as many inroads as possible into the powers of the provinces and 
states vii to respect to the Concur-ant subjects, as the proviso reads: 
"Proverb :hat re eXeCUIne powei referrel IP in sub-clause (a; cf th.S dose shall rot salve as scresit, 
provided 	
COnSctubor or in any Ildo robe by oarliarent ..... 
Therefore not only has the Union Government executive power in respect of Su ojects 
included in the Concurrent List to the extent it is specifically conferred by this 
Constitut on but Parliament may also from time to time mace legislation conferring on 
the Union Government executive power in regard to subjects included in the Concurrent 
list, with the result that all the subjects may be removed from the Concurrent List and 
transferred to the Federal List in cocirse of time. It is not fair. Sir, that provincial 
autonomy should be whittled down to such an extent. In actual practice it will come to 
that. I know, Sir, that to obviate this difficulty, my bonouraft e Friend, Pandit Kurftru, 
has given notice of an amendment for the omission of the words 'or in any lam made by 
Parliament". It will in away remove the difficulty but not the entire difficulty. That is why 
I am persisting in moving my amendment. Sir, under the present Government of India 
Act, even though the Central Government can give only directions to the provincial 
governments in regard to these subjects, in actual practice the provincial governments 
are not ab e to carry on their administration without any hindrance or impediment from 
the retina: Government on account of this power to give directions. We have heard very 
often repeated by our Ministers that even though they do not see eye to eye with certain 
directions issued by the Central Government, they are helpless and cannot do what they 
consider best. Even with regard to the food policy tney say they are able to do what they 
consider to be best in the interests of the province, as they have to obey the eirections 
of the Central Government in this-matter, Very often after the!" return to Madras from 
Delhi, our ministers point out tat though they co not agree with the views of the 
Central Government, they have to carry out their directions because these directions 
have beer issued under the law, even though they do not believe that the policy 
adumbrated by the Central Government in regard to the matter wit be successfu • 
i hope, Sir, that the House will recognise the imporiance of this amendment. As I 
pointed out, already the powers of the provincial governments have been considerably 
taken away and if this clause a so remains as it is, provincial autonomy will become 
almost a nullity. Even under the present provisions, powering Parliament to legislate for 
confernhg executive power on the Union will be only glorified district boards and 
municipalities, and this clause empowering Parliament to legislate for conferring 
executive power on the Union Government with regard to any subjects includeO in the 
Concurrent Kst will be only another nail in the coffin of provincial autonomy. 
Mr. Vice-President : Amendments Nos. 44 and 45 may be moved together. 
Pandit Hirday Math Ktinzru (United Provinces: General) : Mr. Vice-President, I beg

Sir, there are federations of all kinds. There are federations for instance of the United 
States of America, Canada and Australia, but in none of these federal Constitutions does 
the Central Government enjoy tne right no issue executive directions to the provincial or 
State governments. In Canada, concurrent powers of legislation have been given both to 
the Damin.on Government and the provincial governments in regard to two subjects, 
agriculture and im mig radon. In Australia, there are a large number of subjects in respect 
of which both the Commonwealth and the States can legislate. Yet in neither co these 
countries is the Central Government in a position to direct the State nor provincial. 
government to exercise their authority in any particular way. Our Constitution, conveyer, 
departs, from this principle. Under tie Government of India Act, 1935, the Centrai 
Government have the right to issue instructions to provincial governments in respect of 
certain matters. Those matters are connected either with subjects that are exclusively 
within the jurisdiction of the Central Legislature or are contained in Part II of the 
Concurrent List. If the language of the proviso to article SO is accepted, the Central 
Government will have the right to issue Instructions to the Provincial Governments with 
regard to the manner in which they should exercise their executive authority in respect 
of all subjects in the Concurrent bist. What we have to consider is whether circumstances 
have arisen that make it necessary or desirable that such a power should be conferred 
on the Central Government. 
The Honourable Shri K. Santhanam : May I point out to the honourable Member 
that it is only when Parliament makes a law and gives that power that it will extend in 
any State' 
Pandit Hirday Math Ku nzru : I perfectly understand it. That is obvious. If Mr. 
santhanam will bear with me for a while, he will find that I shall not omit to refer to this 
matter. 
I do not see, Sir, that there is any reason why so large a power should be conferred 
on the Central Government. We have to be clear :n our minds with regard to the 
character of the Constitution. While we may profit by the experience of other fedmial 
countries and need not slavishly Copy their constitutons it is necessary that the federal 
principle should be respected in its essential features. We should not go so far in our 
desire to give comprehensive powers to the Central Government to deal with 
emergencies as to make the Provincial Governments yirtualld subordinate to the Central 
Government. Whatever powers may be conferred on the Central Govennment If the 
federal principle is to be given effect "o, the Provincial Governments should be 
coordinate with and not_ 
 ubordinate to the Central Government in tie provincial sphere. 
If this princ.ple is accepted by the House, I think that the proviso in the article uncer 
discussion would be found to be contrary to the relations that ought properly to subsist 
between the Central and the Provincial Governments. The proviso, as honourabie 
Members know, runs as follows: 
leimoped LI at the exec- ve power re-erred 	
n sub cause (a, el mis dameshell mt neve as exmessi, 
piny dm in Mb -Marinate:or 	
in any lay mace by narliamert extem ir any atate 	
netters with respec to Mich 
the Lools sure of the State -as tia pow- n node le as 
If this is accepted, it will ibe ooeir to the Central Legislature to pass a law empowering 
the Central Government to issue directions to the Provincial Governments with regard to 
the mance-  in which the law should be executed. Leber the Government of Inc a Act, 
1935, such a power was conferred on the Central Government, but it was more 
restricted. Sub-section (2) of section 126 of the Government of India Act, 1935 says 
down that the executive authcrity of the Dominion shall also extend to the giving of 
directions to a Province as to the carrying into execution therein of any Act of the 
Dominion Legislature which relates to a matter specified in PartG of the Concurrent 
Legislative List and authodses the giving of such directions," and no bill or amendment 
dealino with this matter be introduced without the previous sanction of the Governor-
General. In the new order, it is quite o ovio us that the Governor-General, who wil, be the 
Constitbtional Head of :he State, cannot be entrusted with the power given to the 
Governor-General by this sub-section. But there seems to me to be no reason why the 
power conferred by sub-section (2) of section 126 of the Government of India Act, 1935 
should be widened in the manner proposed in the proviso to article 60 of the Draft 
Constitution. Ins true :hat the Central Government will not have the right to issue 
instructions to the Provincial Governments with regard to the execution of any law, 
unless the law itself provides that sucn instructions should be issued. But this is certainly 
n 
no check on the power of the Central Legislature. The Central Legislature itsetf will be 
the judge of the propriety of conferring such a power on a Government that is 
respo nsi ole to it. What I am seeking to do by my amendment is to protect the Provincial 
Governments against any unnecessary encroachment on their powers by the Central 
legislature and Central Government. 
Now, Se, it may be pointed out to me that if the words "or in any law-made by 
Parliament" are deleted from the proviso, the Central Government will not enjoy even 
the limited power conferred on it by sub-section (2) of Section 125 of the Government of 
India Act, 1935. I think, Sir, that this can be provided for under article 234. I have 
accordingly given notice of an amendment to article 234 that would enable the Central 
Government to issue instructions to provincial Governments with regard to the execution 
of laws relating to items 25 to 37 of the Concurrent List if the central legislature by law 
authorises the Central Government to do so. 
There is, however:one other matter to which it is necessary to draw the attention of 
the House. Tine second part of my amendment goes beyond anything contained in the 
Government of India Act, 1935- I may be asked how I am proposing an extension of the 
power M tie central legislature and through it of the Central Government when tie 
purpose of my amendment is to see that the executive authority of the provincial 
--396 
Governments is not unnecessarily restricted by orders issued to them by the Central 
Government under laws passed by Parliament. Honourable Members will remember that 
a few weeks ago, the Deputy Prime Minister introduced a Bill in this House the object of 
which was to amend the Government of :nd ia Act, 1935. It was stated in the Statement 
of Objects and Reasons attached to that Bill that experience had shown that uniform 
principles in the review of awards made by the Central and provincial industrial Tribunals 
should be adopted under the overall control of the Central Government. It was therefore 
proposed in the Bill that the Central Government should, in addition to the right of 
suing instructions to the provincial Governments in regard to the manner in which their 
authority should be exercised, also have the power to confer power on their own officers' 
regarding the execution of laws dealing with any of the matters referred to in the 
Concurrent List. I should not like to go into the merits of that Bill; but we have to take 
into account the fact that in the present circumstances it is necessary so to widen the 
powers of the Central Government as to enable them to impose duties on their Rhin 
officers in respect of certain matters if any law made by Parliament permits them to do 
so. The matters with which the all introduced by the Honourable Sardar 
Patel is concerned are industrial matters and a few other matters. Broadly speaking, 
these maters are covered by items 25 to 37 of the Concurrent Lis: contained in the 
Draft Constitution. These matters are, but for two items, the same as those contained in 
Part II of :he Concurrent List in the Government of India Act, 1935. It appears to be 
reasonable In the present circumstances when Labour is becamff g conscious of its 
rights, when questions relating to it have to be settled on an all-India basis, that in all 
these questions that might involve the settlement of disputes between labour and the 
employers there ought to be a powe-  vested somewhere, F. order that matters of 
importance may be dealt with in an uniform manner. I do no: know when the Bill 
introduced by the Honourable Sardar Patel will be considered by the House. But, I have 
little doubt that the power asked for by him will be conferred on the Central Government 
by the Hesse. If that is done, it is obvious that the Draft Constitu t on will have to oe 
amended so that it may be brought into line with the Government of India Act, 1935. I 
have anticipated this necessity and have therefore brought forward an amendment 
authonsino the Dominion Pan iaffert to confer powers or impose duties on the Central 
Government or any of its officers in respect of entries 25 to 37 of the Concurrent List. It 
seems to me, Sir, that the amendment proposed by me meets the needs of the case. 
There is no reason whatsoever why the Central Government should be given the wide 
power that the passage of the proviso would confer on the Central Executive under laws 
passed by the Central Parliament. 
I should like, Sir, to refer to one more matter before I resume my seat. Under the 
Government of India Act, 1935, the power of the Dominion legislature to pass laws 
authorising the Central Government to confer powers and impose duties on their own 
officers with respect to matters In regard to which provincial legislatures could make 
laws coulc be exercised only when a declaration of emergency had been issued declaring 
that the security of India was threatened by war. So far as I remember, Sir, in no other 
contingency was the Central Legislature allowed to authorise the Central Government, or 
to place the Central Officers in a position to deal with the execution of laws on matters 
included in the Concurrent List. In proposing therefore my second amendment, it will be 
seen that I have not copied the provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935: I have 
departed considerably from the provisions of that Act but I have done so in so far only as 
circumstances have proved that the departure is necessary. It is incumbent on my 
honourable Friend Dr. Ambedkar to show that the wide power that he has asked for is 
essential In the present circumstances if law and order are to be maintained in India or if 
its security is not to be threatened or if problems arising in the new circumstances are of 
such a character that the country mil be able to Teal with them only when the Provincial 
Governments have been made practically subordinate to the Central Government. As I 
do not feel that any such circumstances have arisen, I have proposed the amendments 
that I read out a little while ago. r hope, Sir, that they will receive the careful 
consideration of the House.

The impression which this note creates in the minds of the readers is that Some 
power or more power than is apparent in the article is being sought to be vested in the 
provinces but any such irrpress,on is removed by what the Chairman of the Draft ng 
Committee says in Para. 7 of his 'atter to the President of the Constituent Assembly. He 
speaks o the saving clause in the proviso and says--

Wherever the Centre has been endowed with legislative power, it is be ng sought to 
endow it with executive powe- as wed. Our amendments seek to correct this postion and 
say that tne Centre might have leg is alive power on the subjects Mcludec! in Ise 
concurrent list but at least the execacive power ought to be left in the hands of the units-
-the Pmv.raes. Sir, I have to make a few remarks in connection with the scheme of this 
Constitution. It is said :hat the American Constitution has been based on a suspicion of 
the Centcal authorities that the people in power in he Centre would seek to encroach, 
whenever there is an opporturay, on the powers of the States, i.e. the componert parts 
or Units and also of the individua!s. It was contended not only at that time when that 
Constitution was made but also subsequently and even at the present time that such a 
pe
nception of a Constitution is we! based on facts, because it is admitted that when 
ople come to power, more often than not the power corrupts them. Therefore too 
much of power should not be invested or placed in the hands of the executive and the 
supreme authority. But so far as our draft Constitution goes, the contrary ss to be 
adopted. 
 method which has been 
ented. It has been based on the suspicion of individuals 
and the somponent units. The idea seems to be that the incividuals will always'  e 
scheming and conspiring to set the authority at nought and the units would always be on 
the look-out for doing something wrong. Therefore, Sir, though the scheme of things as 
adumbrated in the Draft constitution is alleged to be on a federal basis, it's really over-
weightirg the Centre with too inure power. That .s not salutary at least under tne 
338- 
 
circumstances obtaining in our country. That is not good to the country as a whole. Ours 
a count" of vast distances and a huge population. Therefore it is not conducive to 
efficiency to over-concentrate power in the Centre. Units must be left with adequate 
powers in their hands. 	
must not' 
 e the basis of this Constitution that patriotism and 
anxiety for the welfare of the people are the sole monopoly of the Centre. It must be 
admitted trot the Provinces and individuals also are as patriotic as anybody else. 
Therefore, their rights and powers must not be sought to be encroached upon. The basis 
of this Constitution seems to be suspicion, in the first place of the individuals and then in 
the secondplace of the units. Sir, where the individuals are concerned, it has not even 
been conceded that individuals have got an irreducible amount of right to personal 
freedom. The personal freedom that has been conceded under art.cip 15 is beset with 
serious, and not only a serious, but fatal modifications so much so these modifffat ons 
have eaten ap and swallower up the right of personal freedom. It does not recognse 
that an fat 	
has got any irredTobie right which cannot be taken away by any law. 
And so far as ion 
	
or Units are concerned, the same spirit seems to prevail. By 
various provisions, the powers of the Provinces are sought to be taken away; 
 
Interest of efficient government and good government, I thinic that spirit ought not to 
 and in the 
prevail; and the powers of the units most not be encroached upon. 
These amendments of ours, whie providing for the maintenance of the lea islatl ve 
powers of the Centre where the appropriate subjects are concerned, want to restrict the 
executive field of the Centre. Therefore, I think, they are very reasonable amendments 
which the House should sapport. I also know that if only Members are given the tight to 
vote as they please, and if they are given the freedom of vote on this particular qzestion 
at least, I know 5ir, many Members will vote for these amendments. I know personally, 
Sir, there are many Plempers who feel with me in :he matte: or these amendments. 
Mr. Vice-President : May I suggest that these remarks are not called for here? 
Mohamed Ismail Sahib Bahadur : SIr, I am speaking, with your permission, of 
what I know to be the feeling of many of my colleagues here on this very important 
matter, In these amendments is involved the efficiency o" the government and therefore 
the wedare of the whole country and of the people. These amendments seek to eIminate 
any friction or any conflict that may arise in the future between the Centre and the 
Provinces. If time and again the Centre seeks to encroach upon the rights and powers of 
the units, then, there is sure to be conflict and friction and these amendments only seek 
to remove ary such conflict. And I wanted to make it clear that I am not alone in this 
feeling of mine, that I am not alone in this opinion, but that there are many others 
irrespective of party affiliations, Therefore, I would very much like that the co.leagues of 
mine In this House be given freedom of vote to vote as they please. In that 02se, the 
chairman of the Drafting Committee will know whether there is real support among the 
Members of this House for the idea contained in tnese amendments. If the Chairman of 
the Drafting Committee does not find it in his mind to accept these amendments. may I 
appeal to him, atleast to accept the amendment to our amendment moved by Pandit 
Kunzru wh.ch seeks to remove the words "or in any law made by Parliament". That at 
east would mean something. That would go to some extant to a leviate the conditions 
 I have got in mind and which I have been trying tc express here. It will to a 
certain extent restrict the encroachment upon the powers of the Provinces. Therefore, I 
would appeal to the House ant to the Chairman of the Drafting Committee to consider at 
least the much milder amendment Which seeks to eliminate the words 'or in any lap, 
 
made by Parliament". 
Mr:Vice-President : I have just received information about the sudden death of Sir 
Akbar Hydan, Governor of Assam. He was not a member of this House, but we oil know 
the excel' ent work he has done for our country and we also know that we are indebted 
not only to him but also to his father. The offices of the Government of India are already 
coses! It is true that His Excellency was not a member of this House, but still I thinl<we 
 
ought to offjourn as atrisute to him and as a mark of respect to his memory.

DRAFT CONSTITUTION-(Contd..) 
Article 60-(Contd.) 
Mr. Vice-President (Dr. H. C Mooknerjee) I have just received notice of an 
adjournment motion signed by St ri Mahavir Tyag i. It is ruled out of order under Rule 26 
of the Rules of Procedure and Standing Orders of the Constituent Assembly of India.

of India n respect of the recent attacks on Indonesia 
It is ruled out of order under Rule 26 of the Rules of Procedure and Standing Orders 
of the Constituent Assembly of India. 
We can now resume discussion on article 60. Is Packer Sahib Bahadur in the House? 
B. Pocker Sahib Fa had ur (Madras : Muslim): Mr. Vire-President, this clause as it 
stands is sure to convert the Pe:dere:ion into an entirely unitary form of Government. 
This is a matter of very grave importance. Sir, we have been going on under the idea, 
and it is professed, that the character of the Constitution which we are framing is a 
federal one. I submit, Sir, if this article, which gives even executive powers with 
reference to the subjects in the Concurrent List to :be Central Government, is to be 
passed as it is, then there will be no justification at all in calling th s constitution a 
federal one. It will be a misnomer to call it so. Itwill be simply a camouflage to call this 
Constitution a federal one with provisions like this. It is said that St is necessary to give 
legislative powers to the Centre with retard to certain subjects mentioned in the 
Concurrent List, but it is quite anotner [zing, Sir, to give even the executive powers-  with 
reference to them to the Centre. These provisions will have the effect of practically 
leaving the provinces with absolutely nothing. Even in the Concurrent List there is a 
large number of subjects which ought not to have found place in it. We shall have to deal 
with them when the time comes. But this clause gives even executive powers to the 
Centre wit)) reference to the subjects which are detailed in the Concurrent List. In this 
connection, since the question has been expounded with great lucidity and ability by the 
Honourable Pandit Kunzru, I do not want to take up the time of the House in dealing 
with those aspects. 
39 
Now I mould just like to point out one aspect of the matter and rt Is this. In such a 
Dig sub-co Minent as India, it wilt be very difficult for the authci IL es in the Centro to 
appreciate col rectly the requirements of the people in the remotest parts of this country, 
and this :mobility is there even with -ego rd to leg islat on But eve-  if executive power, 
with reference to those laws dealing with subjects in the Concurrent List, is given to the 
Centre, the result will be that if any person is aggrieved by tee way in which the law is 
executed e very remote part of the country, he has to resort to the Centre which may 
be tthousands
a 
  of miles away, and it is not all people that can fly from one part of the 
country to We other in a few hors 	
rn 
I suait, Sir, that di  we just look into the Concurrent 
List as it is we shall find that tneie are very many subjects whist ought not to have 
found a place in it Anyhow, if trose subjects are to be dealt with by an execut :8 which 
is under the Centre, it will be a very Beat hardship, and I co submit that the machinery 
itself will be very inefficient and ve be a blot on the ac ministration 
If with reference to such subjects as are mentioned in the Concurrent List, the people 
suffer by the bad way in which the executive carries on the administration, the-  the 
result wil t. be that the persons who have got a grievance will have to go a very great 
distance to have matters redressed, and even then it wll be very :tiff cult for the 
authorities in the Centre to realize the difficulties. It has been pointed out that as 
matters stand now as regards the subjects in the Concurrent List, the executive 
authority is in the provinces, and to do away with that practice and to centralise even 
the executive powers in the Centre with regard to al these subjects in the Conchment 
List is a very backward step. Even ;min 1919 onwards when the Blilshers were ruling, 
Provincial Autonomy was considered to be one of the objects of the Reforms. Now after 
we have on freedom, to do away with Provincial Autonomy and to concentrate RI the 
powers in the Centre rea lly is tantamount to totalitarianism, which certainly oug it to be 
condemned. it has become the order of the day to call a are by a bad name and hang 
Well, if some group of persons agitate for protecting their fierce as a great p, it is called 
communelism and it is cordemned. ff Provinces want Proviecai Autonomy to be secured 
to allow matters peculiar to them to be dealt with by themselves, well, that is called 
provincialism, and that is also con ce m ned. If people press for separation of linguistic 
Provinces it is called separatism and it Is condemned. But I only wish that these 
gentleme-  who condemn these Isms' just take ieto consideration what the trend of 
events is. It Is leading to totalitarianism; they ought to condemn that in stronger 
language. But I am afraid that Ice result of the condemnation of these various 'isms', 
namely communalism, provincialism and separat.sm, o r 	
it leads to totalitarianism or 
as even fascism. If there are separate organisations for partiablar groups of people who 
Plink in a particular way, well, that is condemned as communalism or as some other 
'ism'. If all Idnds of opposition the to be got rid of in this sort of way, well, the result is 
that there is totalitarianism of the worst type, and that 	
what we are coming to naving 
regard to the provisions in this Draft Constitution as they stand. 
Therefore, it is high time that we take note of this tendency and see that we avoid it 
and that we do not come to grief. : 
 grief. = submit that at :east as regards this provision, the 
amendment only seeks to make a very moderate demand, namely that with reference to 
matters in the Concurrent List, even though the Centre may have legislative power, the 
executive cower with reference to those subjects shogid be left to the Provinces. this is 
a very moderate dernaid, and as has already been pointed out, honourable Members 
from various Provinces do feel teat these executive powers shodld be left to the 
Provinces. But as we all know, they are not able to give effect co their views Dor obvious 
reasons, arid I do not want to raise questions which may create a controversy. But I 
would submit that those honourable Members who do really feel that this amendment is 
one if:hide is for the good of the people and that acco-ding 	
their conscience it ought to 
be carried, ought not to hesitate from giving effect to their views according to their 
conscience. I would remind honourable Members tnat the duty we have to perform here 
is o very sacred one ard that we answerable to God for every oct we are doing here, and 
if the defence is that we did net act according to our conscience En account of rho whip 
that is issued, I submit, Sir, the honourable Members will realise that it is no defence at 
all. 
Shri L. Krishnaswami Bharathi (Madras : General) : Sir, is it necessary to make all 
these references' 
B. Pocker Sahib Bahadur I am making all these references do account of facts 
which cannot be denied. 
 
Mr. Vice-President: I am afraid Mr. Pocker Sahib is raising a controversy. 
B. Pocker Sahib Bahadur : Mr. Vice-President, Sir, I have already stated that I do 
not want to enter into this controversy, but I have got every right to appeal to each and 
every her curable Members. 
Mr. Vice-President Nobody is preventing the honourable Member from doing it. 
B. Pocker Sahib Bahadur : have got a right of appeal to every Individual Member 
to exerc)se his right of vote accord ir g to his conscience. That is why I am making these 
submissions. I have to make this appeal on account of obLi.obs reasons on which I do not 
want to dwell. The honourable Members know, I know, and the Honourable the Vice-
President Knows it. Therefore, I do not want to dwell on those aspects of the case. 
Mr. Vice-President : The HonouraMe the Vice-P-esident, has absolutely no 
knowledge of this. 
B. Pocker Sahib Bahadur : Well Sff, I hope the Honoumble the Vice-President, will 
not compel me to dilate more on this topic. Anyhow, fake 17 that the Honourable the 
vice-Pres dent knows that Party Whips are issued and Members are being guidec by 
these Whips. to put it in a nutshell. That is a fact well-known and cannot be denied, and 
therefore, it is, that I make this special appeal to tne honourable Members that if they 
are satisfied in their conscience that this is a matter in which they should support the 
amendment, they ought not to hesitate from doing so, and if they so require they ought 
to seek the permission of the Party to which they are affiliated. 
Shri T. T. Krishna method (Madras : Generai): Mr. Vice-President, Sir, I reel it my 
duty to opoose the two amendments that are before the House, to article 60. Sir, the 
two amendments fall into two distinct categories. The amendment that was proposed by 
my honourable Friend Mr. K. T. M. Ahmed Ibrahim merely sought to cut out the proviso 
to sub-clause (1) of article 60. That was the original state of the amendment. If the 
amendments were carried in that pa -ticuiar form, it would mean that the Federal 
executive power will be co-extensive with the legislative power that the Union has, 
namely, not only.will it extend to List I labt it will also extend to List III. 
Subsequently apparently my honoui able Friend found out his mistake and has sought 
to amend the body of sub-clause (1) of article 60, which limits the power of the 
Federation in regard to executive matters and completely prevents it from exert' sing it 
in the Fled of Concurrent legis otion. Well, that, Sir, the House is aware, will mean going 
back on tie present provisions of the Government of India Act. The position was 
remedied by my honourable Friend Pandit Hirday Nath Ktinzru. With his characterisLic 
precision ce framed an amendment whim will exactly fit in mbh the position that was 
envisaged in the Government of India Act of 1935 IL does rot concede any more 
executive power to the Centre than what it has under the Government of India AM, 
1935 Sir, there is also a considerable amount of difference in the approach of the 
Movers of the two amendments The three speakers who suppoited the amendment of 
;393 --- 
Mr. Ibrahim, inciuding the mover, objected to the they's° to article 60(1) on political 
grounds. ley honourable Friend Pandit Hirday Nath Kunzru objected to it on theoretical 
grounds. Let me first deal with my nor Durable Emend Pandit Kunzru's objections. He said 
that Federation or Federalism in in the Draft Constinnion before the  House will become a 
farce if the position that is taken up by the Government of India Act in regard to the 
sphere of executive action that could be exercised by the Central Government in the 
concurrem held is changed, if the s are dotted or the t' s are crossed. Pandit Kunzru is 
a person who is well known for his wide reading. His experience is profound and I shall 
not seek to controvent his right to lay down the law. But, nevertheless, he made a 
fundamentah mistake in saying that there is a particular type of federalism or 
constitut on which alone can be called federal and that the word 'Federal' or 'Federalism' 
had a compiete connotation of its own, excluding every possible inroad into it. I inkst 
also point out that Pandit Kunith made., big blunder in character;sing our draft 
constitot on as being something which would not be federal if the proviso of the article d 
retained. 
Sir, in regard to what is a Ferieithl Constitution, there are various interpretations. It 
varies widely. For instance, the Canadian Constitute, which is one of the four prominent 
Federal Constitutions in the world is characterised by some as not being wholly federal. 
On the ether hand it does happen that in the actual working of the Constitution, 6 is 
more fede-al than the Australian Constitution width, from the strictly constitutional point 
of view, is undoubtedly folly federal. It is said often times that a Constitution becomes 
Fed erai because of the fact that the component units are first formed and then the 
Centre is created. That is the opinkrn expressed by Lord Hal Dane in 1913 as an obiter in 
a 
 
matter that was referred to him arising out of ar Australian litigation wierein he 
mentioned that the Canadian Constithtion was not Federal in so far as, while the British 
North A,-elan Act was passed by Parliament, the Centre and the OrOvinces were 
created at the same time. 
Similarly there are ether views in regard to what makes a Federation. Another view is 
that the residuary power must he with the units and not with the Centre. Where and how 
this fact exactly detracts from the concept of Federalism nobody knows. This particular 
aspect is emphasised by reference to the United States Federation. If that is so, 
undoubtedly the Draft Constitution before the House is not fed era:, for one reason that 
the residbary power is not vested in the units; fo-  another reason that it (the Drat 
Constitution) creates both the Centre and the Provinces at the same time. 
Sir, If we are to accept this view, we would be merely theorising in regard to 
Federates. 1 hold the view that we have no reason to take a theoretical view of the Draft 
Constitution at this stage. The concept of this constitution is undoubtedly Federal. But, 
how far Federalism is going to prove to be of benef t to this country in practice will only 
he determuned by the passage of time and it would depend on how far the various forces 
inter-act conceding thereby to the provinces greater or lesser autonomy than what we 
now ermikage Bfit I will repeat once more the fact that in actual practice it has 
happened that in Canada the provinces have greater amourt of liberty of action under a 
Constitution which is not avowedly fully Federal, than in Australia where the interference 
by the Centre into the affairs of the units has' 
 een considerable. 
 
Pandit Hirday Nat'l Kunzru (United Provinces : General) : May I interrupt my 
honourable Friend to ask whether he is aware that in Canada the power of the provinces 
is greater than it is supposed to be because of the decisions of the Privy Council? 
Seri T. Kris hnam a dm in :t only supports my statement of fact that the Indian 
Constitution, when it is passed, will ether become ally federal or partially fedei a in 
actual p actice over a perkod of rime it may be that if we are going to leave the field of 
authority for the Centre and the units completely u -defined the courts may interpret it 
39 
one way or the other. It is corceizabie that if we say nothing about the exercise os the 
ecutive powers in the Concurrent List, the courts may interpret it one way or the other 
and the Constitution may become more federal or less federal as circumstances arise 
and the views of the judges in this regard and the decisions they arrive at. So, I think 
the interruption of my honourable Friend is without any force and : see no reason why I 
should answer it at greater length. 
Sir, in regard to this question of executive action in regard to concurrent powers on 
which actually the objection is being taken, the position is that the Government of India 
Act has been framed with a certain amount of attention for precision. Professor K. C. 
Wheare, in a short but exhaustive work on Federal Government, has pointed Cut this 
particular fact--though he does not concede that the Government of India Act establishes 
a full federation—that that Act 's one of the most potable examples of Federation where 
the powers of the Centre and the units are clearly defined and the three Lists are more 
or less exhaustive. 
Sir, in regard to the provisions of pis Concurrert List, the Draft Constitution or the 
1935 Act are by no means unique. The fact is that the Australian Constitution practically 
leaves tne entire field of regisiativo action in the Concurrent List save for a few : that are 
enumerate.: 
 
n Section 52 of the Australian Constitution. Section 61 which is the 
corresponding section in the Australian constitution to article 60 of our Draft Constitution 
says that the executive power extends to the execution and maintenance of the 
Constitution and of the laws of the Commonwealth. And an attempt by a State to 
interfere with the free exercise of the executive power by the Commonwealth was 
declared nvalid in 1903 in a case D'Ec den vs. Redden The position in regard to the 
distribution of powers in the Australian Constitution is however nebulous and assuredly 
the framers of the Government of India Act were conscious of that fact and that is why 
they have Named the three lists whim: are far more precise. 
Sir, if you look back to what happened in Canada where passage of time has more or 
less dehm,ted the precise scope cf Federal and Provinc al executive power, we find that 
there has been room for friction in various important matters. And in the Rowell-Sirois 
Report on Dominion—Provincial Relatior.s, certain changes have been recommended. 
They have recommended that in the field of labour legislation particularly, and in :he 
field of social services like Unemployment insurance, etc., the power should be given to 
the Federation not only for the purpose of legislation which it possesses to some extent, 
but also 'n the field of executive action. With this backarodnd let me, Sir, now examine 
the position in the Government of India Act in regard to the aliocation of powers under 
the Concurrent List in view of our experience of the last twelve years. 
Sir, the Joint Select Committee in dealing with this particular aspect of the separation 
of powers and also in investing the Central and Provincial Governments with executive 
powers in respect thereof have been rather careful. 
Sir, they say--

Sir, that was the plen envisaged in the Government of India Act. That was the reason 
why a sumclayse was added to Section 126, i.e., sub-clause ;2), which gives power to 
the Centre to give executive directions in so far as the subjects covered by Part II of the 
Concurrent List is concerned. Dr. I want to tell my honourable Friends in this House that 
in actum practice we found that so far as Part II is concerned executive directions were 
rated 
 ecuate to achieve the objects of the legislation undertaken by the Centre. Sin, it 
raised very important problem. Who is to be ultimately responsible for carryino out the 
objects of such legislation in a responsible government' The provincial governments are 
responsiale to the provincial legislatures and it has happened on far that the provincial 
executive tai  often said, "Oh, the Centre has given its directions, we have no funds, we 
have no administrative machinery, we do not know what to do and it is unfair that it 
should be our business to do the actual work in these matters when somebody else lays 
down the law." The present scheme ;n the Government of Incia Act is defective by 
reason el the fact that tine Fels. of executive responsibility biurs. We do not know where 
it begins and where it encsand , 
  oneof the reasons why th s proviso has been put in 
which has been carefully worded is that, where the Government of India want to lay the 
executive responsibility squarely on the shoulders of the provinces or the units, it can do 
so by not mentioning in their legislaton:  that they are possessed of any executive power 
in regard to any particular legislation. This is a variation of the provision contemplated in 
Section 126 (2) and it is a wise variation in so far as the lines of demarcation are clearly 
laid down. The Government of India where it possible or necessary, perhaps ir the 
field over 
 cial legislation, in social insurance, u employment and perhaps lab min will 
take over the executive responsiboity by laying down in the related Acts that the 
executive authority shall be that of :he Geyer men[ of India, Where there is no specific 
provision the executive responsibility win be that of the provinces and the provir 
mMistrics cannot shirk their responsibility for amying out the objects of the aegis abort 
Sir, I wish that my honourable Friend, Mr. tamivan Ram, who has been in chalice of
plec
legislation, would speak or. :his subject, because times without 
omb 
number ee have round 
ound that we have had to sail very close to colourable legislathon in 
such mattens. That, Sir. I think is a eery valid reason, a reason which is dictatec by 
experience, for us to put a provision of the na ure cf, 
 the proviso in clause ;1) o this 
article which I can assure you;  does not 
de 	
t an iota from the federal character of this 
Draft Constitution. After all, what s s federa. constitution' It is one :hat lays down 
precisely the field where the units are sup 
 rem and another field where the Centre is 
supreme. Where it is not possible to tie ill 	
This clearly it has got to be done n some 
other manner where the responsibility will be precisely indMated, and this proviso to 
article 60 makes the constitution more federal than it would otherwise be. Therefore I 
think the objection of my honourable Friend, Pandit Hirday Rath Kunzru, is without any 
point; it is without any reference lo tie experience of the 1935 Act which has been 
gained during these twelve years; to M without reference to the theory and practice of 
federalism; it is without reference to the experience of Australia and Canada and 
therefore has got to be rejected. 
Sir, I shall turn my attention to the other amencment, the originally imperfect 
amendment, which seeks to give greater powers to the provinces in regard to concurrent 
subject, and practically limits the powers of the Centre in the executive field to nothing, 
which was moved by my honourable Friend, Mr. K. T. 	
Ahmed Ibrahim and ably 
supported by Mr. Muhammad Ismail and Mr. Pocke r. Sir, the House will be aware that 
these honourable Members are fairly important people, particularly Mr. Muhammad 
[small who happens to be the President of the Muslim League in India and the vi coal 
successor to Mr. Jinn ah. When be makes a political statement, it cannot be dismissed as 
being something which is of no value, cme of the reasons why the Government of India 
Act is so e aborate, one of the reasons why such creat emphasis on provincial autonomy 
was 
 
laid in the past, one of the reasons why we in tnis country agreed to the Cabinet 
Statement of May 16, 1946, was the fact that the Muslim League wanted complete 
freedom of action in the provinces which it controiled. Sir, that circumstance no longer 
exists ow mg to the dissection of tne country into two. That circumstance has now faded 
-376  r 
into obscunty, and therefore it seems to me that my honourable Friend is simply starting 
the trouble from the beginning viz., the agitation that provinces should have greater 
powers when actually there is no attempt to fetter the pows.of the provinces, If there 
is any opposition to this Draft Constitution, it is a political opposition rather than an 
opposition to any particular feature of this Draft Constitution. My honourable Fr ends 
have warned us that we have a conscience, that we have to act according to that 
conscience. I may tell the honourable Members of this House that their conscience will 
not be affected in any way if they approve of article 50, as it stands, that they may rest 
assured that there will be no inroads into the freedom of action of the provinces and that 
really no real limitation of the executive power of the provinces is contemplated. 
Provincial cp:nion will be adequately represented in the Parliament to be: the pros and 
cons of each particular piece of Legislation contemplated in this article will be adequately 
canvassed before the Centre is cranted executive power in regard to any subject which 
falls in the Concurrent List. I right again draw the attention of the House to what was 
mentioned In the Joint Select Committee's report in respect of the 1935 Act that they did 
not contemplate that even in the matter of giving executive directions under Section 126 
(2), it would be done right over the wishes of the provinces, because after all the Centre 
was not something apart from the provinces. Even in the future the Central Legislature 
will only consist of representatives of the units. In one House it will be representative of 
the unit legisiatures. In the other House it will be representative of the people cf the 
units. b y   Centre can have no existence in the future apart from tie provinces cr units 
and why therefore suspect the bona fides of that legislature and say that legislature will 
grant powers to the Centre in such a manner as would fetter the freedom of action of the 
units? 
Sir, on t le other hand, as I said once before, [Hs proviso precisely delimits the 
functions of the Centre and the units. There will be no more ambiguity, no more blurring 
of respcnsib lity. I feel that intensically the article is sounc and the House will not, I have 
no doubt. 	
guided by the threats uttered by these appeals to conscience, the threat of 
the totalitarian state of things to come which my honourable Friends from Macias of the 
Muslim League think is going to come to pass. Sir, this article 	
 
B. Packer Sahib Ba had 	
: Is i: not a fact that whips are being issued over such 
questions? 
Shri T. T. Krishna mocha ri I have no desire to answer my nonourable Friend. 
Whips may Pe issued. We know what ,s being done. It is a matter of convenience. If 
some of us do not congregate together and get through the work :Fat is to come before 
the House by mutual agreemest, I am afraid this House will have to sit for three or four 
years. By acting together some of us, not exactly the members of one Party but a 
number of people who act together are only expediting the framing of this Constitution 
for our country. Well, I can conceive that my honourable Friend does not want a 
constitution for this country. If that is his idea, well, he might object to the meth adby 
which we are carrying on the work. Sir, I think these allegations are without any point. 
The basis of the opposition is polLtical. It has its origin in the fact that the Muslim League 
never wanted India to be a strong country, with a strong government. Therefore, Sir, I 
hope the ?louse will dismiss all these vague threats and all these allegations and support 
the article before it. 
The Honourable Dr. B. R. Ambedkar (Bombay r General) Mr. Vice-President, Sir, 
I am sorry that I cannot accept either of the two amendments which have been moved 
to this proviso, but I shall state to the House very briefly the reasons why I am not in a 
position to accept these amendments. Before I do so, I think it is desirable that the 
House should know what exactly is the difference between the position as stated in the 
vi 
proviso and the two amendments which are moved to that pro o. Taking the Pro so as 
It stands;  it lays down two propositions. The first proposition is
vis  
that generally toe 
-)(1e4- 
dir 
add' 
authority to execute laws which relate to what is ailed the Concurrent field, vit effer the 
law is passed by the Central Legislature or wheth r 	
passed by the Provin cia or State 
Legislature, shall ordinarily apply to the Province r the State. That is the first 
proposition which this proviso lays down. The sec nd proposition which the proviso lays 
down is that if in any part cula-  case Parliament thinks that in passing a law which 
relates to die Concurrent fled the execution ought to be retained by the Central 
Government, Parliament shall have the power to do so. Therefore, the position is this; 
that in all cases, ordinarily, the executive authority so far as the Concurrent List is 
concerned will rest with the units, the Provinces as well as the Stases. It is only in 
exceptional cases that the Centre may prescribe :hat the execution of a Concurrent law 
shall be with the Centre. The omendments which have been moved are different in their 
connotation. The first amendment is :hat the Centre snould have nothing to do with 
regard to the administration of a law which relates to matters placed in the Concurrent 
field. The second amendment which has been moved by my honourable Friend, Pandit 
Kunzru, although it does rot permit the Centre to take upon itself the execution of a law 
passed in the Concurrent field, is p-epared to permit the Centre to issue directions, with 
regard to Tatters falling within Iterns 25 and 37, to the Provincial Governments. That is 
the difference between the two amendments. 
The first amendment really goes much beyond the present sodtion as set out in the 
Government of India Act, 1935. As honourable Members know, even under the present 
Government of India Act, 1935, it is permissible for the Central Government at least to 
issue directions to the provinces, setting out the method and manner in which a 
particuian law may be car-ied out. The first amendment I say even takes away :hat 
power which the present Govern men: of India Act, 1935, gives to the Centre. The 
amendment of my honourable Friend, Pandit Kunzis wishes to restore the position back 
to what s now found in the Government of India Act, 1935, 
Pandit Hirday Rath Kunzru : I go a little beyond that. Tre second part of my 
amendment goes beyond any 7001e' which the Government of Inc;a now enjoy under the 
Goveruniert of India Act, 1935. 
The Honourable Dr. B.R. Ambedkar: Well, that may be so. That I said is the 
position as= understard it. Now, Sir, I will deal wish the era] or amendment which wants 
to go back to a position where the Centre will not even have the power to issue 
directions, and for that purpose, it is necessary for me to go into the history of this 
particular matter. It must have been noticed—and I soy it merely, as a matter of fact 
and without any kind of insinuation in it at all,--that a large number of members who 
have spoken in favour of the first amendment are mostly Muslims. One of them, my 
Friend Kr. Pocker, thought that it was a sacred duty of every Inember of this House to 
oppose the proviso. I have no idea 	
 
B. Pecker Sahib Bahadur : I nave not said that, Sir. I only said that it is the duty of 
every Member to act according to his conscience. 
The Honourable Dr. B. R. Ambedkar : By which I wean, I suppose that every 
Member who has conscience must oppose the proviso. It cannot mean anything else. 
(Laughter.; 
B. Pocker Sahib Sahadur Certainly not. 
The Honourable Dr. B. R. Ambedkar : Now, Sir, this peculiar phenomenon of 
Muslim members being concerned in this particular proviso, as I said, has a history 
behind it. and I am sorry to say that my honourable Friend, pandit Kunziu forgot 
altogether that history; I haue no douot about it that he is familiar with that history as I 
am myself. 
 
This matter goes back to the Round Table Conference which was held in 1930. 
 
Everyone WhO is familiar with what happened in the Round Table Conference, which was 
held in 1930 will remember that the two major parties who were represented :n that 
Conference, namely the Muslim League and the Indian National Congress, found 
themselves at loggerheads on many points of constitutional. mpor:ance. 
One of true points on which they found themselves at loggerheads was the question of 
provincial autonomy. Of course, it was realised that there could not be complete 
provincial autonomy in a Constitution which intended to preserve the unity of India, both 
in the matter of legislation and administration. But the Muslim League took up such an 
adamant attitude on this point that the Secretary of State had to make certain 
concessions in order to reconcile the Muslim League to the acceptance of some sort of 
responsible Government at the Centre. One of the things which the then secretary of 
State did was to introduce this clause which is contaned in Section 126 of the 
Government of India Act which stated that the authority of the Central Government so 
tar as legislation in the concurrent Field was concerned was to be strictly limited to the 
issue of directions and it should not extend to the actual administration of the matter 
itself. The argument was that there would have been no objection on the part of the 
Muslim League to have the Centre tidy 	
a particular :aw in the concurrent field if 
the Centra Government was not likely to be dominated by Me Hindus. That was so 
express ni stated, I remember. during the debates in the Round Table Conference. It is 
because me Muslim League Governments which came into existence in the provirees 
where the Musgms formed a majority such as for instance id the North-West Frontier 
Province, the Punjab, Bengal and to some extent Assam, did no: *ant it in the field 
which they thought exclusivehr belonged to them ay reason of their majority, that the 
Secretary of State had to make tags Concession. I have no doubt about it that this was a 
concession. It was not an acceptance of the principle that the Centre should have no 
authority to administer a law passed ir the concurrent-  filed. My submission therefore is 
that the position stated in Secton 126 of the Government of India Act, 1935, .5 not to be 
justified Or. prEnciple; it is justified because it was a concession made to the Ntisi'ms. 
TherefOr=, is not proper to rely upon Section 126 in draining any support for :he 
arguments which have been urged id favour of this amendment. 
Sir, that the position stated in Section 126 of the Government of India Act was 
fundamentally wrong was admitted by the Secretary of State in a subsequent legislation 
which the Parliament enacted just before the war was declared. As honourable Members 
will remember, Section 126 was supplemented by Section 126-A by a la y./ made by 
Parliament just before the war was declared. Why was it that the Parliament found it 
necessary to enact Section 126-A2 As you will rem ember Section 126-A is one of the 
most drastic clauses in the Government of India Act so far as concurrent legis,ation Is 
concerned, It permits the Central Government to legislate not only on provincial 
subjects, but it permits :he Central Government to take over the administration both of 
provincial as well as concurrent sub;ects. That was done because the Secretary of State 
felt that at least in the war period, Section 126 might prove itself absolutely fatal to the 
administration of the country. My submission therefore is that Section 126-A which was 
enacted for emergency Purposes is aPplicable not only for ar emergency, but for 
ordinary purposes and ordinary times as well. My first submission to the House therefore 
is this: Gays 
 o argument that can be based on the principle of Section 126 can ao valid 
in these days for the circumstances which have mentoneo. 
Coming to the proviso, ,,,, 
B. Packer Sahib Bahaclur : With your permission., Sir, may I just correct ow 
learned Friend? This Constitution is bong framed for the present Ind IanUnion Ip which 
there Is not a single province in which the Muslims are in a majority and therefore there 
is absolutely r no point in saying that It is the Muslim members that are moving this 
_355- 
 
amendment in the interests of the Vuslim League. It is a very misleading argument 
based on a misconception of fast and the Honourab e Minister for Law forgets the fact 
that we n the present Indian Union. Muslims as such are not in the least to be 
particularly benefited by Bus amendment. 
The Honourable Dr. B. R. Ambedkar : I was just going to say that although that is 
a stateme nz of fact which I absolutely accept, my complaint is that the Muslim members 
have not yet given up the philosophy of the Muslim League which they ought to They 
ale repeating arguments which were valid when the Muslim League was there arc the 
Muslim Provinces were there. They have no validity now I cannot understand why the 
Muslims are repeating them (Interruption,) 
Mr. Vice-President : Order, order. 
The Honourable Dr. B. R. Ambedkar : I was saying that there is no substance In 
the argument that we are departing from the provision contaireo in Section 126 of the 
Government of Midis Act. As I said that section was not based upon any prinnipts at all. 
In support of the proviso, I would like to say two things. First, there Is ample 
precedent for the proposition enshrined so to say in this proviso. My honourable 'mend 
M. T. T. Stistinarnachari has dealt at some length with the position as It is found in 
various countries which have a federal Constitution. I shall not therefore labour that 
point again. But I would just like to make one reference to the Australian Constitution. In 
the Australian Constitution we have also what is called a concurrent field of legislation. 
Under the Australian Constitution it is open to the Commonwealth Parliament In making 
any law in the concurrent field to take upon itself the authority to administer. E shall just 
quote one short paragraph from a well known book called " Legislative and Executive 
Power in .Australia" by a great lawyer Mr. Wyr es. This M what he says: 
"Lastly, there are Commonwealth Statutes. Lefroy states that executive power is 
derived from legislative power unless there be soma restraining enactment. This 
proposition is true, it seems, in Canada, where the double enumeration commits to each 
Govern men: exclusive  Legislative powers, but is not applicable In Australia. Where the 
legislative power of the Commonwealth is exclusive—e.g., In the case of defence—the 
executive tower in relation to the subject of the grant Inheres in the Commonwealth, but 
in respect of concurrent powers, the executive function remains with the States until the 
Commonwealth legislative power is exercised." 
Whits' means that in the concurrent field, the executive authority remains with the 
States so long as the Commont.eal h has not exerc sed the power of making lams which 
it had The moment It does the execution of that law is automatically transferred to the 
Commorwsalth. Tnerenare, cot panng the position as set out in the proviso 'mitt the 
position a_ :t is found in Australia, I submit that we are not making any violent departure 
from any federal principle that one may like to quote. Now, Sy, my second submission is 
that there is ample justification for a proviso of this sort, which permits the Centre in any 
pit pular case to take upon itself the acministration of certal n laws in the Conan rent 
list. Let Hie give one or two illsst at ons The Constituent Assembly has passed article 
11, which ado fishes untouchability. It also permits Parliament to pass applopriare 
legislation to make the abolition of untouchability a reality Supposing the Centre makes 
a law prescribing a certain penalty, certain prosecution for obstruction caused to the 
unlouchaPles in the exercising of their c VIC rights. Supposing a law like that Ass A ade, 
and 
 
supposing that in any part solar province the sentament in favour of the abolition of 
untouchapkity is not as genuine and as intense nor is the Government interested In 
seeing that the untouchables have all the civic rights which toe Constitution guarantees, 
is it logical, is it fair that the Centre on which so much responsibility has been cast by 
the Constitution in the matter of urnaucnability, should merely pass a law and s with 
folded hands, waiting and watcning as to what the Provincial Governments are doing in 
the matter of executing all those particular laws? As everyone will remember, the 
execution of such a law might require the establishing of additional police, special 
machinery for taking down, if t-.e offence was made cognizable, for prosecution and for 
Al costs of administrative matters without which the law could not be made good. 
Should not the Centre which enacts a law of this character have the authority to execute 
RP I would like to know if there is anybody who can say that on a matter of such vital 
importance, the Centre should do nothing more than enact a law. 
Let me give you another illustration. We have got in this country the practice of child 
marriage against which there has been so much sentiment and so much outcry.'_ 
have been passed by the Centre. They are left to be executed by the provinces. We all 
know what the effect has been as a result of this dichotomy between legislative authority 
resting in cne Government and executive authoring resting in the other. I understand 
(and I thinIF my friend Pandit Bharagava who has been such a staunch supporter of this 
matter has been stating always in this House) that notwithstanding the legislabon, child 
marriages are as rampant as they were. (s it not desirable that the Centre which is so 
much interested in putting down these evils should have some authority for executing 
laws of this character? Should it meren allow the provinces the liberty to do what they 
liked with the legislation made by Parliament with such intensity of feeling and such keen 
desire of putting it into effect? Take, for instance, another case—Factory Legislation. I 
can remember very well when I was the Labour Member of the Government of India 
cases after cases in which it was reported that no Provincial Government or at least a 
good many of them were not prepared to establish Factory Inspectors and to appoint 
them in order to see that the Factory Laws were properly executed. Is it desiraffe that 
the labour Iegislations of the Central Government should be mere Paper legislations with 
no effect given to thorn? How can effect be given to them unless the Centre has cot 
some authority to make eerie the administration of laws which it n-akes? I therefore 
submit that having regard to the cases which I have cited—and I have no doun: 
honourable Members wiil remember many more cases after their own experience—that a 
large pact of legisiation which the Centre makes in the concurrent filed remains merely a 
paper legislation, for the pimp e reason that the Centre cannot execute its owe laws. I 
think it is a crying situation which ought to be rectified which the proviso seeks to do. 
There is one other point wnich I would like to mention and it is this. Really speaking, 
the Provincial Government sought to welcorne this proviso because, there is a certain 
sort of financial anomaly in the existing position. For the Centre tc make laws and leave 
to provinces the administrations meats imposing certain financial burdens on tre 
provinces which is involved in the employment of the machinery for the carrying out of 
those laws. When the Centre takes upon itself the responsibility of the executing of those 
laws, to that extent the provinces are relieved of any financial burden and I should have 
thought from that point of view this prov.so should be a we come additional relief which 
the provinces seek so badly. I therefore submit, Sir, that for the reasons I have given, 
the proviso contains a principle which this House would do wail to endorse. (Cheers),

THE

OE AMERMAN

The 
Pconomis 
Corporate settlements in the United States 
The eriminalisation of American business 
Companies must be punished when they do %%thug, but the legal system has become an 
extortion racket 
Aug 30th 2014 I From the prmt ccimon 
HO runs the world's most lucrative shakedown operation? The Sicilian maim? The People's 
aeration Army in China? The ldeptocracy in the Kremlin? If you are a big business, all these are less 
asping than America's regulatory system. The formula is simple: fmd a large company that may (or 
ty not) have done something wrong; threaten its managers with commercial ruin, preferably with 
minal charges; force them to use their shareholders' money to pay an enormous fine to drop the 
urges in a secret settlement (so nobody can check the details). Then repeat with another large 
apany. 
amounts are mind-boggling. So far this year, Bank of America, SI:Morgan Chase, Citigroup, 
dman Sachs and other banks have coughed up close to $no billion for supposedly misleading 
tstors in mortgage-backed bonds. BNP Paribas is paying S9 billion over breaches of American 
t -2 
sanctions against Sudan and Iran. Credit Suisse, UBS, Barclays and others have settled for billions 
more, over various accusations And that is just the financial institutions. Add BP's $13 billion in 
settlements since the Deepwater Horizon all spill, Toyota's $1.2 billion settlement over alleged faults in 
some cars, and many more. 
In many cases, the companies deserved some form of punishment: BNP Paribas disgustingly abetted 
. genocide, American banks fleeced customers with toxic investments and BP despoiled the Gulf of 
Mexico. But justice should not be based on extortion behind closed doors. The increasing 
criminalisation of corporate behaviour in America is bad for the rule of law and for capitalism (see 
article (http://www.economist.cominews/briefing/21614101-corporate-am  erka-finding-it- ever-
harder-stay-right-side-lats-mammoth-guilt) ). 
No soul, no body? No problem 
Until just over a century ago, the idea that a company could be a criminal was alien to American law. 
The prevailing assumption was, as Edward Thurlow, an 18th-century Lord Chancellor of England, 
had put it that corporations had neither bodies to be punished nor souls to be condemned, and thus 
were incapable of being "guilty_ But a case against a railway in 1909, for disobeying price controls, 
established the principle that companies were responsible for their employees' actions, and America 
now has several hundred thousand rules that carry-  some form of criminal penalty. Meanwhile, ever 
since the 1960s, civil "class-action suits" have taught managers the wisdom of seeking rapid, discreet 
settlements to avoid long, expensive and embarrassing trials. 
The drawbacks of America's civil tort system are well !mown. What is new is the way that regulators 
and prosecutors are in effect conducting closed-door trials. For all the talk of public-spiritedness, the 
agencies that pocket the fines have become profit centres: Rhode Island'sbureaucrats have been on a 
spending spree courtesy of a ffsoom payout by Google, while New York's governor anclattomey-
general have squabbled over a $613m settlement from JPMorgan And their power far exceeds that of 
:rial lawyers. Not only ate regulators-in effect judge and jury as well as plaintiff in the cases they 
'Yung; they can also use the threat of the criminal law. 
zfinancial firms rarely survive being indicted on criminal charges. Few want to go the way of Drexel 
3matham Lambert or E.F. Hutton. For their managers, the threat of personal criminal charges is 
:inter-ending ruin. Unsurprisingly, it is easier to empty their shareholders' wallets. To anyone who 
isks, "Surely these big firms wouldn't pay out if they knew they were innocent?", the answer is: oddly 
:none], they might. 
icrhaps the most destructive part of it all is the secrecy and opacity. The public never finds out the full 
acts of the case, nor discovers which specific people-with souls and bodies-were to blame. Since the 
ases never go to court, precedent is not established, so it is unclear what exactly is illegal. That enables 
ture shakedowns, but hurts the rule of law and imposes enormous costs. Nor is it clear how the 
agulatory booty is being carved up. Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, who is up for re-

te coo 
eleclion, reportedly intervened to increase the state coffers' share of BNP's settlement by $1 billion, 
threatening to wield his powers to withdraw the French bank's licence to operate on Wall Street. Why 
a state government should get any share at all of a French firm's fine for defying the federal 
government's foreign policy is not clear. 
ee you in court—in another life 
the best thing would be for at least some of these cases to go to proper trial: then a few of the facts 
would spill out. That is hardly in the interests of the regulators or their managerial prey, but 
shareholders at least should push for that. Two senators, Elizabeth Warren and Tom Coburn, have put 
onward a bill to make the terms of such settlements public, which would be a start. Prosecutors and 
regulators should also be required to publish the reasons why, given the gravity of their initial 
accusations, they did not take the matter all the way to court. 
In the longer term, two changes are needed to the legal system. The first is a much clearer division 
between the civil and criminal law when it comes to companies. Most cases of corporate malfeasance 
tre to do with money and belong in civil courts. If in the course of those cases it emerges that 
individual managers have broken the criminal law, they can be charged. 
the second is a severe pruning of the legal system. When America was founded, there were only three 
;pacified federal crimes—treason, counterfeiting and piracy. Now there are too many to count. In the 
nost recent estimate, in the early rygas, a law professor reckoned there were perhaps 300,000 
-egulatory statutes carrying criminal penalties—a number that can only have grown since then. For 
inancial firms especially, there are now so many laws, and they are so complex (witness the 
housands of pages of new rules resulting from the Dodd-Frank reforms), that enforcing them is 
iecoming discretionary. 
his undermines the predictability and clarity that serve as the foundations for the rule of law, and 
isks the prospect of a selective—and potentially corrupt—system of justice in which everybody is guilty 
,f something and punishment is determined by political deals . America can hardly tut-tut at the way 
'hina's justice system applies the law to companies in such an arbitrary manner when at times it 
eems almost as bad itself.

CHAPTER 1 
THE EXECUTIVE 
The President and Vice-President 
The President of 	Art. 52. There shall be a President of India. 
India. 
Executive 
power 	Art. 53. (1) The executive power of the Union shall be 
of the Union. 	
vested in the President and shall be exercised by him either 
directly or through officers subordinate to him in accordance with 
this Constitution. 
(2) Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provision, the supreme 
command of the Defence Forces of the Union shall be vested in the President and 
the
m 
 exercise thereof shall be regulated by law. 
(3) Nothing in this article shall— 
(a) be deemed to transfer to the President any functions conferred by any 
existing law on the Government of any State or other authority; or 
(b) prevent Parliament from confening by law functions on authorities other 
than the President. 
No theory of Separation of Powers underlying the Constitution.—I. Though 
Mt. 53 of our Constitution vests the executive power in the Redden!, there is no similar provision 
in the Constitution vesting the legislative and judicial powers also in other bodies. Further, by 
jetieducing the principle of ministelial responsibility, Le., by making the Executive head (the 
President or the Governor) liable to act on the advice of Minters who are responsible to the 
Legislature, the Constitution of India has departed from the theory of Separation of Penmen which 
underlies the Mahican Constitution. Again, there are certain provisions in the Constipation itself 
which provide for the conferment of legislative powers on the Executive or the Judiciary and so on. 
Thus, Art. 140 provides that Parliament may confer upon the Supreme Court the Power to make 
rules (which is a legislative power). Article 357 provides that under a Proclamation of Emeregency, 
It shall be competent for Parliament to provide that the powers of the State Legislature to make laws 
shall be exercised by the President! The power of the President to make Ordinance doing recess 
of the Legislature is another instance of legislative power in the hands of the Executive. 
2. But Though our Constitution has not strictly adhered to the doctrine of Separation of 
Powerfie it does not follow that under our Constitution any organ of the Government can encroach 
upon the constitutional powers of any other organs or delegate its constitutional fimcdons to any 
other organ or authority. A written Constitution, by Is very nature, involves a distibudon of 
powers. Though the legislative and executive powers are not vested by the Centeno-ion in the 
Legislature and the judiciaty expressly, it is clear from the different provisions of the Consfithion 
that, baring specified exceptions, the power of making laws shall be exercised by Parliament and 
the Legislatures of the States and power of adjudication and interpretation of the Constitution shall

Exercise of executive power not dependent on prior legislation.-I. It is one 
of the functions of the Executive to execute the laws. This does not Mean, however, that the 
executive function is confined to the execution of laws or that in order to enable the Executive to 
function in respect of any subject there must be a law already in existence. Spedfic legislation may, 
of course, be necessary to Mom expenditure of the public funds or to encroach upon private nghts, 
which can not, under the Constitution, be done without legislation, But, apart from this, it can not 
be held that in order to undertake any function, such as, entering into any made or business, the 
Executive almost obtain prior legislative sanction.'

Manner of election of President 	
Art. 55 
475 
Electoral college.—f. in view of the mandatory time limit in Art 62 for holding the 
election of President in case of a vacancy, the election may be completed even though election may 
not have taken place, for unforeseenreasons, in some of the State Legslative Assemblies which 
constitute the electoral collegcfie  e.g., a recent dissolution:I°  
2. The object of Art. 54 is only to prescribe qualifications required for electors to elect the 
President. it has nothing to do (a) with the time for the election to ml the vacancy before the 
expiration of the term of the outgoing President, or (b) to prevent the holding of the election before 
expiration of fiat terrn by reason of dissolution of the legislative Assembly of a State 52  
3. The electoral college is independent of the Legislatures mentioned in this Article and none 
of chase Legislatures have any separate identity sismais the electoral college. The 'electoral college' 
 
compendiously indicates a number of persons, holding the qualifications specified in the Article so 
constitute the electorate for election of the President and to act as independent electors. The words 
'consisting or refer to the strength of the electoral college. The dissolution of a Legiff ative Assembly 
simply means that there one 	
elected members of that Assembly and are not enntled to cast votes 
at the Presidential election which might take place before the next election to thee Assembly takes 
place. In short, the 'electoral college' 
 is always ready to meet the situation at the expiry of the tefin 
of office or my vacancy in the office of President caused by death, resignation, removal, or 
otherwise.ff  
4. The true meaning of Asti 54 is that only such persons as possess the qualifications of being 
elected members of either House of Parliament or the Legislative Assembly of a State at the crucial 
time of the date of election will be eligible members of We electoral college entitled to cast vote at 
the election to fill the vacancy caused by expiration of the tens of the Presidentan At any particular 
time, there may not be the full strength of the electoral college. Thus, if a person, who was an 
elected member of a Legislative Assembly ,  ceases, at the relevant date of the Presidential election, 
to become an elected member by reason of death, resignation, or disqualification or dissolution of 
that legislative body; such a member would cease to possess the qualification to be anelector and 
would not be endtled to vow at the Presidential election; bun for that matter, the Presidential 
election can not be postponed beyond thc time limn which is mandatory.ff  
5. The Courtn refrained from expressing any opinion as to what would be the effect of a 'maks 
fide' dia$01116.011 Of a Legislative Assembly or if a substantial number of Assemblies were dissolved 
before the Presidential elecdon But these questions would not anse now, because of Art.  
which uses the words 'for whatever reason'  [See under Art. 71(4), past.] 
Cl. (b): 'Legislative Assemblies of Statee.—Members of the Legislatures of 'Union 
Territories'  created under Art. 239A are not members of the electoral college under An 54(b), 
because Art. 229A refers to them as 'Legislature'  and not fingislative Assembly', and also because 
AG 367(1) does not say that post-Consfitution amendments, outside Art. 372, made to the General 
Clauses Act would be applicable in the metier of interpretation of the Constitution (as distinguished 
from interpretation of ordinary laws for which provision has since been made ill Art. 3714, post).62

Art. 72 485 
'Commute the sentence.-The power of the President to commute any sentence is not 
subject to any conshtudonal or judicial restraints exuept that it can not be used to enhance the 
sentence.' It intended to afford relief from undue harshness of evident mistake 2  
The long time lag which elapsed subsequent to the date of offence (rape on a rninor) and the 
fact that the prosecuhix got married and is well-settled in life during the intervening period, may be 
factors for consideration by the executive or the constitutional authorities in deciding whether 
remission of sentence could be allowed to the cony:eta.  
Arts. 32 and 72.-It is not impermissible for the Supreme Court to recommend to the 
President, in a fit case, that he may exercise It power under Art. 72.4 	
• 
Art. 72 and a. 433A of the Criminal Procedure Code 1973.-1. Section 432A of 
the a. P.C. is not wolalive of the provision in Art. 72 (or Art. 161), because the source and 
substance of the two powers are different.5  
2- Nor does s. 433A control the unfettered power of the Executive under Art. 72 (or Art 16r, 
in any way, but since, the legislative measure has been made as sponsored b the Central 
Government,6 it would be dutiable for the Government not to overlook the spirit 	
s. 433A, in 
exercising ib power under Art. 72.7  
Exereise of the PenVer.-1. Being an e.xecutive power, the power of the President is to be 
exercised on the advice tendered by the Council of hlimstersfi 
2. Subject to the above, the President may sautinise the evidence on record of the criminal 
case and come Eo a different conclusion from that recorded by the Court. In doing so the President 
does not amend or modify or supersede the judicial record. The President acts in a wholly different 
plan. He acts under a conslltutional poorer, and is entitled to go into the merits of the ca
ses 
If he 
takes a different view it would not amount to supersession ofjudicial verdict 
3. Again, the proceeding before the President being of an executive character, the petitioner 
has no right to insist an. presenting all oral argument. The manner of consideration of the petition 
lies aidan the discretion of the Presidentio 
4. It is an absolute power, conferred by the Gonilitudon and is not subject to any statutory 
proms:u 
Judicial review of exercise of President's power.-1. Since the President's power 
under Alt 72 is a constitutional power and is an executive power [7  unlike the Court's statutory and 
judicial power under ss. 932 and 433(a) of the Cr. P.C., the order of the President under Art. 72 can 
not be subjected to judicial resew and the meritata The power is of the widest amplitude and the 
Court can not even suggest guidelmesil 
2. It follows that- 
(a) It must be presumed that the President acted properly and carefully after an objective 
consideradon of all aspects of the matter i5

Art. 73 
Part V - The Union 
(b.) No Court can ask for the reasons why a mercy petition has been rejected 16  
If, however, reasons are given in the President's order, and these are held to be irrelevant the  
Court would interfere.
3. But the Court has admitted judicial review on some specified grounds, e.g. - 
(a) To determine the scope of the President's power under Art. 72.12  
(b) The Court can interfere where the President's exercise of the power is vitiated by self-
denial on erroneous appreciation of the full amplitude of the power conferred by Art. 72, 
e.g., where the President rejected a mercy petition on the erroneous ground that he could 
not go behind the final decision of the highest Court of the land,t2  or where the 
President's decision is wholly irrelevant to Art. 72, or arbitrary, discriminatoryor mein 
(c) To determine whether there has been an inordinaie tieing in disposing of . mercy petition 
which prolongs delay in execution of the death sentence, for no fault of he accused-and 
thus inflicts additional penalty by way of worry and suspense over and above the 
sentence of death as awarded by the Court.21 In case of inordinate delay,22 the Supreme  
Court would, under Art. 32, substitute the sentence of death into one of imprisonment for 
lifc.23  
4. While an earlier mercy petition has been dismissed by the President, the convict can net

Parent of exec:afie power of the Union 	
Art. 73 487 
Art. 73: Extent of executive power of the Union.—(i) The Union shall have 
exclusIve executive power for (a) the administration of laws made by Parliament under Its exclusive 
powers; (b) the exercise of its treaty powers [cf. Art 253]. 
By virtue of Cl. (I) (a), the executive power of the Union shall be co-extensive with the 
legislative power of the union Parhament. In other words, it will extend over the whole of the 
tenitory of India, with respect to the matters enumerated in Lists I and ill of the 7th Schedule. But 
this is subjects the two exceptions engrafted in the Proviso to Cl. (I), and ina.(2). 
(ii) The Proviso to a. (I) says that executive authority in regard to matters In the Concurrent 
list shall be ordinarily left to the States, for Parliament shall be entitled to provide that in 
exceptional cases the executive power of the Union shall also extend to these subjects. 
If the Ministers are constandy under the (ear or threat of being proceeded against in a court of 
law for even the slightest of lapse or under the constant fear of exemplaty damages being awarded 
against them, they will develop a defensive attitude which would not be in the Interest of 
administaion.M  
Wider than prerogative powers in England.—The executive powers of the Union 
and the States under Arts. 73 and t62 are muds wider than the prerogative powers in England?? 
?Subject to the provisions of the ConstitutiorM—Apart from the provisions of 
Am. 73 and 162, executive power is conferred upon the Union as well as a State Government as 
regards three specified matters- 
1' 	
0) carving nn of any suds or business [Art 298J; 
og animism, holding and disposal of propirty part. 2981, 
(II) analung or contracts tot any purposes IAA 199] 
`Executive power'..—See under Art. 53(1), gni& 
Whether specific legislation is required for the exercise of executive 
power relating to a particular subject.—I. The Supreme Court has held that under our 
anseilution, the functions of the Executive are not confined to the execution of laws made by the 
Legislature and already in existence. Articles 73 and 162 indicate that the powers of the Executive 
of the Union and of g]State are co-extensive with the legislative power of the Union and of a State, 
as the case may be. While the Executive can not act agabul the provisions of a law, it does not 
follow that in order to enable the Executive to function relating to a particular subject, there must 
be a law already in existence, authorising such actiongn 
2. Once a law is passed, the executive power can be exercised only in accordance with such 
law so far as it goes, but the Government is not debarred born exercising in executive power 
nerely because a Bill relating to the subject is pendEng before the Legislature.fo  
3. Legislation may, however, be required where the Constitution itself p °vides that the 2U can 
be done by legislation, e.g., for the imposition of tax Art. 265b for expenditure of money 
[Art 266(3)1g0  encroaching upon fundamental rights. )Arc19(2)(6)] or other legal dgitsS 
[e.g., Art. 300A].

Cl. (1): Use of British conventions to interpret Arts. 74-75.-1. It is now settled 
ilLut since the Cabinet system of Government has been introduced into the Indian Constitution from 
the British modelss and since all the conventions can not possibly be codified exhaustively, it would 
be legitimate to refer to the Mash conventions in interpreting the prosisions of Arts. 74-75, maims. 
of course, they are excluded or modified by these or other provisions of the Consatulion of India.44  
2. The COUIT can not refuse to entertain a gueston as 'political' if it involves the Interpretation 
of the Constitution or of a statute, which is a judicial funclion.48  In the Rajasthan case,4s BEG, 
observed (pare 59) that `IL g not for the Courts to formulate, and much less, to enforce a 
convention, however, necessary" but the consensus of opinion in the Supreme Court,49 as just 
stated. is to the effect that the conventions of the British Cabinet system, as they obtained when our 
Consdhthon was adopted, are admissible to Interpret the provisions relating to the Cabinet system 
under Art 74S1  and the following Articles of our Constitution. 
Relation between the President and the Council of Ministers. '2-1. Tho gy

3. The foregoing interpretation given by the Supreme Court to the original Cl. (I),55 has beer, 
the imperative word 'shall'. 
buttressed by the 42nd Amendment, 1976, by adding the italicised words at the end of Cl. (1), using 
4. 
The only change made by the 44th Amendment Act, as regards this arneximent, is to add a 
Proviso, which empowers the President to ask the Council of Ministers to r econinier their advice, but —
if they indst after such reconsideration, he shall be bound to act according to Odd advice. 
5. 13ut the introduction of the word 'shall' is bound to raise other controversies. Though, 
Ii erally. the word shall' indicates an absolute imperative it was pointed out by the Supreme Court 
„.1976 decisions° that there are certain exceptional cases where, in rhe nature of things, the 
President. 
 an not act according to the advice of the Council of Ministers.. The question is, whether "- 
even in these exceptional circumstances, the 1976-amendment would require the President of hidia - 
to seek and act according to the advice of a Council of Ministers. Of course, these exceptions are _ 
based on the Engdsh system of Cabinet government which has been imported into India.
54 The 
question whether these exceptions would survive the imperative text introduced by the 1975- 
amendment has to be solved by applying the canons of interpretation. 
6. One of the canons of interpretation is that though the word 'shall' indicates an absolute 
imperative, the Court may acknowledge exceptions where the former construction would lead to an 
absurdity:3° Applied to the question of ministerial advice, it would appear that the President can not 	
a 	
. 
be required to act according to ministerial advice where such advice is not available or the function 
Is Inherently of such a nature that it can not be performed with the advice of the existing Council of 
Ministers. The quesfioo should be answered with reference to the several relevant circumstances - 
separately. 
I. Choice of She Prime Minwet A new Prime Mnister has to be appointed when a Prime 
Minister in office either dies or resigns, thus, dissolving the entire Council of Ministers. In A tiglatif 
it is settled, that though the Crown has to act, as a constitutional ruler, only on the advice of his 	
-- 
Council of Ministers, through the Prime Minister, there are certain exceptional circuMstances to 	
..—.. 
which the advice of a Prime Minister is not arailable,5h and, therefore, the Crown is entitled to actin 	
_ 
the exercise of his own judgment One such occasion takes place when a Prime Minister dies or 	
5,  
resigns. Obviously, the advice of the Mime Minister m office can not be available when he is dead 
or his office ceases by resignation.

Crown can not act according to the advice of any Prime Minister.m

2. T. Ls also to be noted, in this context, that in the case of the President them is no provision._ 
corresponding to the latter part of CI. (1) and Cl. (i3) of Art 163, according to which the Governor , 
steed not act with the advice of his Council of Ministers as regards those functions which he is, by 
the Constitution, authorised to act 'in his discretion'. In the case of the President there is no such - 
esceprton of discretionary functions, and the obligation to act according to the advice of the 
Council of Ministers fastens to the entire realm of the Avsident's funciaons.

In such a case, therefore, the word 'shall' in the amended Art. 74(l) can not be construed as 
imperative. 
(b) The positon would be the same where a Council of Ministers is unseated by 
a vote of no-
confidence and it resigns, but there is no possibility of forming an alternative government, 
cormmulding confidence of the majority M the House of People. it has been held by some High 
Courts61  that in such a situation, the President may select some member o f
f the House who, in his 
estimation, is more even 	
conunand a rnaority in the House. and ask ll to form a Council of 
Ministers', and that even if the latter fails 'to secure a vote of confidence or othenvise establish his 
command over the majority, he may be asked to conthme with his Council of Ministers until 
another House is elected after dissolution. It is clear, therefore, that in the 
choke and appointment of 
a person as 
the Prime Minister, under Art. 75(I), the President can not, possibly act according to the 
advIce of any Council of Ministers The choice of a new Prime Minister after the death or 
resignation of is  Rime Minister thus, an exceptional circumstance when the President has to act 
a:cording to his discretion, notwithstandthg the 1976-amendment of ;krt. 74(1). 
The Supreme Court has held that the President, while exercising the executive power under 
Art. 73. read Art. 53, discharges such of those powers which are exclusively conferred on his 
individual discretion (like appointing the Prime Minister under Art. 75), which are not open to 
judicial review.61  
II. Advice of dissaulin. 
Article 8.5(2) empowers the President to dissolve the House of the 
People at any time, prior to its usual term provided in Art 83(2). Under amended Art. 74(1), this 
function can, 
ma facie, be exercised only according to the advice of the Council of Mutates. lf, 
therefore, a Prim
e 
ime Minister, in office, advises the President to dissolve Parliament, the President can 
ask the Council of Ministers, once, to reconsider, but he can not eventually refuse 
to o 
 blige the 
Prime Minister. 
In England, 
dissolution is a royal prerogative53 but by convention, this power can normally be 
exercised  by the Crowe only according to the advice of the Cabinet, through the Prime Minister. 
But there is a further convention that there are exceptional circumstances in which the Crown 
would be justified in refusing dissolution to a Prime Mnister,“ 
There an altemadve government can be formed with another person as the Prime 
Minister, to carry on the administration Nvith a working majority, for a reasonable period. 
(ii)
Where there is a general feeling that a fresh election would be detrimental to the national 
economy, particularly when the request for dissolution comes closely on the last election. 
(Ili) Where a Ptime Minister who has advised dissolution, is defeated at the General Election 
which ensues, and requests for a dissolution again. 
On the contary, there is a group of publicist in England, who are of the opinion that there has 
been no instance of a refusal by the Crown of dissolution as advised by a 
Prime Minster doting one 
century and that there are instances where, even in exceptional circumstances, the Sovereign has

Art. 74 493 
Art 200 was "another instance where the Governor may act iffiespeffive of any advice from the 
Council of Min iSterS", 
(a) Now, so far as the PresiderII'S power under Art. III is concerned, the 1976-Amendment 
of Art 74(1) leaves no doubt that this power of the President must also be exercised 
according to ministerial advice, because while exercising this power, mmisterial advice 
would be available and the function Is not such that (like the choice of a Prime Moister) 
It can not be exercised according to ministerial advice. 
(b) As regards the Governor's corresponding power under Art. 200, obviously, it Is not 
included In the last of his functions which are to be exercised 'in his discretion', 
Some complication Is, however. Introduced by the fact that there is the second Proviso to 
Art. 200 as well as some other provisions in the Constitution, e.g., the 1st Proviso to Art 31A which 
makes It obligatory for the Governor not to give his assent to a Bill, even though he may be so 
advised by his Ministers, but to reserve the Bill for consideration of the President, in the specified 
cases. In such cases, if the Govern(); acts according to ministerial advice, contrary to the express 
provisions of the Consaturion, his assent would be multi° 
The question is whether even outside these cases, the Governor has the implied authority to 
withhold his assent and reserve the Bill for the consideration of the President. RAY, CJ. opined,'" 
(para 56) that even in these cases the Governor would be justified to act according to 'the best of his 
Judgment' and to 'pursue such courses which are not detrimental to the Stain'. It is quite possible
hat when different political parties are in power at the Union and the State levels, the County of 
Ministers of a State may not like sensitive legislative measures to be forwarded to the President for 
acting according to the views of the Union Council of Ministers. Can the Governor, in such a 
situaton, withhold his assent against the advice of his Council of Ministers, on the ground that such 
advice of Ministers, responsible to the State Legislature, would be detrimental to the national 
interest? The advocates of State power would point out that the power under Art. 200 stands, 
outside the list of discretionary powers or functions under the Constitution as well as those express 
provisions which make It obligatory for the Governor to reserve a Bill for the President's 
consideration. Such contention deserves a fuller consideration by the Supreme Court in some future 
case, because the pros and cons do not appear to have been fully examined in Samaras's case

31n the exescise of his fanction3.-1. These words are not qualified by any other 
condition. Hence, the obligation to act according to the advice tendered by the Council of Ministers 
would embrace all the functions which the President is entitled to discharge under this Constitution, 
erg, whether they appertain to the 'executive power of the Union' under Art. 53(l), tinle,73 or they

3. The same principle idennties the President (or the Governor) with the Government of India -

India (or the State Government), it would come within the purview of Mt. 7750 (for Art. 163).

The Proviso.-Even in England, where the Monarch is a conshtubonal ruler, he retains the 
right to be consulted, to encourage and ro warn'. allot right of the constitutional head is 
incorporated in the Constitutton of India, by this amendment In the result, though the President 
shall be bound to act according to ministerial advice (except in few cases when such advice is not 
available). it "does not necessarily mean immediate acceptance of the Ministry's .first thoughti, The 
President can state all his objectons to any proposed action and ask his Ministers u). Council, if -

The assertion of the Proviso seams. to have been inspired by the aforesaid observational of --

Cl. (2) : Jurisdiction of Courts barred.-1. This Clause embodies the principle of 
confidentikity and secrecy of Cabinet deliberations and of the advice tendered by the Council of 
v. 
Ministers to the President, who has the power to dismiss them. Even though after the 197f. 
amendment of Cl. (I), the President is bound to act according to the advice of the Council of 
Ministers, the Courts are powerless to compel the President to take the advice of the Council of 
Ministers on any matter mid then to act orilti in accordance with such advice because Courts are 
barred by the Constitution to compel production of the advice, or the reason behind that advice,nc 
if any, tendered by the Council of Ministers. In short, if any President flouts the Council of 
Ministers, die latter may proceed against hinEitchlically, by way of impeachnent, but can not obtain 
any kg& relief:16  from the Courts. 
2, If however, the Government produces the papers showing what advice was in fact tendered 
by the Council of Ministers to the President, e.g., where mala fides is alleged, there is no bon to the 
Court looking into such papers and to come to its Endings on the basis thereof.

3. But though the Court can not compel the Government to produce /ke adder tendered by 
tie Mirasters to President or the reasons therefor, there is nothing to prevent the Court to compel 
production of the materials upon which the advice or its reasoning was based, because the 
Pnatekald can not be said to be a part of the advice. in other words, the bar of judicial review is 
confined  to die fachim of advice but not the reasons, i.e. the material on which the advice is 
EDUIRdedEEKE  e g., the correspondence between the Ministers and the Chief Justice of India or of 
Delhi, in the matter of transfer of or confirmation of certain Additional Judges, on the basis of which 
the Council of Ministers tendered their advice.9I Upon such disclosure of themterials, it is 
competent for the Court to give relief to the litigant in cases of non-compliance wionsikutonal 
requirementsds  or of mob fides.9 
4. It is the duty of Supreme Celia to prevent disclosure when Art. 74(2) is applicable, 'The 
notings of the officials which lead to the Cabinet decision form part of the advice tendered to the 
President as the Act was preceded by an Ordinance promulagated by the President. .. It is well 
settled that the privilege can not be waived", (The claim for production of documents in question 
was The item) 
The immuniry claimed under Art. 74(2) and S. 123 of the Indian Evidence Act can not be 
claimed by 
way of mere administratioe routine. The factors to decide the public interest immunity 
would include (a) the interests affected by their disclosure; (b) where the class of privileged 
documents is invoked, whether the public interest imrmuuty for the class is said to protect; (c) the 
extent to which the interests have become stale by passage of time; (d) the sedousness of the issues; 
(e) the likelihood that the production of documents will affect the outcome of the case; (f) the 
likelihood of injustice if the duciunents are not produced.95  
Arts. 74(2) and 356 (1).-1. Article 74(2) is not a bar against the scrutiny of the material 
WI the bas of which the President has arrived RE his satsfaction for Psumg the Proclamation under 
Art. 336(1) [lamas 90, 167(II), 453(6)].99  It merely bars an inquiry into the question whether any, and 
if so, what advice was tendered by the Ministers to the President. 
What Aw. 74(2) provides is that an order Issued 1n the name of the President could not be 
questioned on the ground that it was either conerary to the advice tendered by the htukisters or was 
issued with 	
obtaining may advice from the Ministers Ipara 9499  
2. E does not bar th resit 
 calling upon the Union of India to disclose to the Court the 
maim& upon which the President has formed the requisite satisfaction. Even if the material is 
looked into by the President, it does not pastake the alienate' of advice [para. 453(609

the exception—"except when the House stands dissolved or prorogued"" The Minister includes the 
Prime Minister, even if he isnot a member of either House of Parliament° 
Hence, when upon the fall or resignation of a Council of Ministers, the President accepts the 
advice of the Prime Minister to dissolve the House of the People but asks the outgoing Piine 
Minister to rally on until a new House is constituted after election, the title of the Prime Minister, 
during the period of dissolution, can not be challenged on the ground that it contravenes the 
condition of responsibility laid down by Art. 75(3).2 
la the Constiturion, there is no mention of any orrice of Deputy Prime Minister. When a senior 
Minister (Devi Led), while taking oath, described himself as Deputy Prime Minister', It was alive/ 
before the Supreme Court that an oath as Deputy Prime Minister being not in accordance ividi the 
presenption of the Consecution the appointment of the person taking oath was vitiated. The Court 
held that as a substantial part of the oath was properly followed, the appointment was valid. Even 
though described as Deputy Prime Minister, he would have no powers of the Prune Minister and 
would remain a Minister only s 
"Collective responsibiltity".—It has two meanings : the first that all members of a 
Government are unanimous in support of policies and exhibit that unanimity on public occasions 
although while formulating the pikcies, they might have differed in the Cabinet the the 
second that the Ministc s, who had an opportunity to speak for or against the policies in the C

are thereby personally and morally iesponsible for its success and failuretv

person who is not a member of eithe

r House of the Parliament can be appointed a Minister in the 
Central Cabinet (including a Prime Minister) for a period of six consecutive months and if during 
that period he is not elected to either House of Parliament he would cease to be soap and even if 
such a non-member is appointed a Prime IDnister, he can retain his membership of the State

paternally, so that it could not be delegated to any other person by making Rules of Business under 
Arc. 77(3). In die facts of the case11  the Court set aside an order of termination of service of a 
Government servant on the ground that the order of exemption from die requirement of inquiry, 
under Proviso (c) to Art 311(2), had been made on the satisfaction of a Joint Secretary to die 
Government of India, by virtue of power delegated under Att. 77(3), and that the President did not 
satisfy hirnsdf of the need for dispensing with the inquiry by Art. 311(2). 
3. The unanimousdecinon in Sendarilath orneha has, however, been overruled by a Special 
Bench of 7 Judges in Samsher Singles case 2(  In this case, it has been held that— 
(1) The decision in Jayanfilat22 was confined to Ant 258, and had no bearing on Arts. 74, 75 
and 77. 
(ii) Whenever any 'executive function' was to be exercised by the President, whether such 
function was vested in the Union or In him as President, It was to be exercised with the 
advice of the Council of Ministers, the President being a constitutional head of the 
executive, and was also subject to allocation under Art. 77(3), subject to certaun 
excepdons, which related to extraondinaly situations: 
(a) choke of the Pine Monster: 
60 diem-deal of a GOVernment which Teases to quit, hne tog lost its majority In the House of the People; 
(C) dusoluLlon of the House, when appeal to the electorate becomes neceesHy 23  
(iii) Even those functions which were required by the Constitution to be performed on the 
subjecao so thf oaten of the President (ergs  under Proviso (c) to Art 311(2)1, could be 
delegated by Rules of Business made under Art. 77(3), to a Minister or to a Secretaly to 
the Government of India, because 'satisfaction' in these Articles lArts. 123, 213, 311(2), 
Prov. (c), 317, 352(1), 350, coon 	
with other relevant provisions of the Constitution, 
does not indicate the satisfaction of die President (or the Governor), personally, but in the 
constitutional sense, the satisfaction of the Council of Ministers who advise the Pres:dent 
(or the Governor), which may further he delegated to a particular Minister or official 
under die Rules of Business framed under Art. 77(3) or 166(3). In such cases, 'the 
decision of any Minister or officer under the Rules of Business 	
is the decision of the 
President or the Governor respectively".fil However, the order passed by the Minister, 
though expwssed in the name of the President, remains that of the Minister and it cannot 
be heated to have been issued by the President pemonally and such an order is subject to 
jut:Ba re.fiew.25

to the President against an order of dismissal, under a statutory-  provision could be heard by a 
Minister cr other officer to whom it might be allocated under Rules made under Art. 77(3). The .. 
Court seems to have proceeded under the following reasoning 
(a) Dismissal of a Go" ernment servant is an 'executive function' even though it involved a 
3unsiludfdal Inquiry, so that the whole of the function could be allocated by Rules udder  
Art 77(3). 
(b) Art. 77(3) does not involve any 'delegation'. When a function is allocated, thereunder, the -- 
decision of the Minister or Officer who is allocated that function and the order that 
emerges beocme the decision and order of the Minister. 
5. Previous to inerfatf's ease,2a it bad been held, in the context of the parallel provision m yrt 
166(3), Mai when a Sante vested a power in the State Government it could be allocated to a  
Minister or a specified officer, even though it involved a subjective opinion29  or quasifodidal - 
function 31) 
statutory provision in the 'President'. 
6. Snyati's easeal extends the foregoing principle to a quasi-judicial fwaction vested by a 
The cycle of full Ministerial responsibility is thus now complete, so far as the Courts are 
concerned, and little remains of the thesis that the President under the Constitution is not, in all 
respecd a constitutional head of the executive like the British Crown, and this is now placed 
beyond any controversy, by the 197C-amendmem of Art. 74(1), ante. 
7. It follows from the above that all orders made by the President, whether the function is by 
the Constmulion vested in the Union or in the President by designation, do not require the personal 	
-' 
signature of the President What is required Is that they are expressed in the name of the President 
and are authenticated in the manner laid down in Am 77(2) 22

Legislature for all such acts [Art 75(3)1, it does net mean that each and every decision must be 
taken by the Council of Ministers or by each Ministefr, freponaltytit  
3. Article 77t3) says that, apart from allocating business among the Ministers, the president on 
the advice of the Council of Ministers, can also make rules for The more convenient transaction of 
the business-. Hence, the Minister is not expected to burden himself with the day-to-day 
adminishafron. By the Rules of Bt  sines&  framed under An 77(3), a particular official of a Ministry 
(say, the Secretary, joint Secretary or the like) may be authonsed to take any particular decision or 
to discharge any particular function. When such authorised official does any act, so authorised, he 
does so, not as a delegate of the Minister, but on behalf of Ms Governments's  Subject to the overall 
condo) of the Minister and his right to call for any file or to give directions, the validity of any 
decision made by an authorised official cannot be challenged on the ground that the decision was 
talon by an official and not the Minister concernedtit  
4. In short, the act of the Minister or official who is authorised by the Rules of Business, is the 
act of the President (or the Goternor) or of the Government of India (or the State Government) in 
whom the function or power is vested by the Constitution or by whys 
 tarute.38

said to be holding a trust on behalf of the people so as to be liable for any criminal breach of 
trust.fifi 
Rules of Business.—The power to make Rules of Business under the present Clause may 
be traced from An. 53(1) which says that the executive power of the Union shall be exercised by 
the President dfrectly or through officers subordinate to him in accordance with the Constitution, 
and An 71(1), according to which he is required to discharge his functions with the aid and advice 
of the Council of Ministers. The Rules of Business enable these powers to be exercised by a 
Minisceriti or any official subordinate to him, subject to the political responsibility of the Council of 
Ministers to the Legislature, 
-Where an article of the Articles of Association of a Govt. company empowered the President 
of India to Issue 'three:Wes' to the company by way of contiol over it, the Supreme Court held that

Amendments. —1, The amendment of a fltta),22  by the (42nd Amendment) Astt, 1976, 
serious 
have had seous and far-reaching effects. finder the original text of sub-CL (a). the general 
rule was that any person holding an 'office' of profit or service under the Government was not 
eligible as a candidate for membership of the Legislature, unless Parliament (in the case of 
membership of Parliament) or the relevant State Legislature 	
the case of membership of a State 
Legislature! passed a law exempting the particular office from the disqualification. The general tale 
was founded on the imperative need for neutrality and imparting* in the public service. A positive 
legislationwas therefore needed to rename the disqualification in any particular case, on special 
grounds, besides the exceptions already mentioned in Cl. (2). The 1976-amendment sought to

2. The changes made by the 1976-amendment have. however, been omitted, and the ongmal 
text of Ad. :02(1)(a) has been restored, by the Constitution (44th Amendment) Act, 1978.7s 
a. By the 52nd Amendment Act, 1985— 
(a) Original CI (2) has been made an Egg/any/ion to a. (I). 
 
(b) Substituted Cl. (2) has been me-educed to give effect to the provisions in the Tenth 
Schedule (pest), which has been added in order to combat the pal of &Petition. Para 2 of 
this Schedule. read with Para 6 lays down the contingencies upon the happening of any of 
which a member of either Mouse of Parliament shall be 'daqualf cd' for being a member 
or Parlitancm. 
To make the provisions in Art 102 comprehensive, Cl. (2) has been substituted,' to bring in the 
additional gorund of disqualification introduced by the 10th Schedule. 
Scope and object of Art. 102.—This article lays down the same set of disquahfications 
for election as well as continuing as a member 53  In other words, it provides for both pre-ernstind 
and supervening disqualitication.40  
The object of enacting Arts. 102(1)(a) and 191(1)(a) is that there should be no conffict between 
the duties and interests of an elected member. and that such an elected member can carry on freely 
and fearlessly Its dories without being subjected to any kind of governmental pressure. These 
Articles are intended to eliminate the posibility-  of conflict between duty and nacres; so that the 
puBp of the Legislature is unallectedtil 
Cl. (1); The material date for determining disqualification.-1. Since the 
nomination can not be accepted unless he is qualified under the Constitution and the law on the 
date of any of the nomination, if the candidate lacks the prescribed qualifications, say, the age 
of 25 years anger Art. 84 age73, on the date of such scrutiny, his nomination becomes invalid even 
!Ingo. he may attain the age of 25 yens on the date of the eleconn 62  
2 An exception most be acknowledged in the case of a ciction of the candidate scoff 
 
aside on appeal, for, the law is that when a conviction i3 	
aside on appeal it wipes off the 
conviction retrospectively, as if it had never been passeda7  Hence, even though the candidate's 
nomination had been rejected on the ground that on the date of scrutiny of the nomination. he was 
disqualified on account of a conviction (as spedfied), the order of rejection of nomination would be 
set aside in an election petition if at any time during the pendency of the election petition, the order 
of conviction is set aside on appea1.34  the result would be similar where the candidate had been 
elected, after au Improper rejection of the opponent's objection to the candidate's nomination on 
the ground of conviction, but the disqualificaton is removed by the setting aside of the conviction 
on appeal doling the pendency of the election petition brought by the opponent to have the 
election to bed 
 eclared void.6 
For being ... 2—This means that if, even after his election, a member incurs any of the 
disqualifications specified in Art. 102(1), he ceases to be a member of Parliamentrn But Art. 104 
does not say that if an elected member sits or votes before taking oath as prescribed by Art. 99, he

existed any circumstances whatever necessitating the issuance of the Ordinance, before the

challenge to the existence of such circumstances will not be enough to shift the burden of proof to 
the Executive to establish those circumstancesll.

violates substandve prosisions such as Art. 301,12 	
(d) its retroactivity is unconshrutionalba 
'Same force and effect as an Act of Parleament1.--1. By reason of these words, 
the competence of the President to make an Ordinance is co-extensive with...the power of Parliament 
to make a law on the same subject's Hence, all the Entries in the Legislative List which are 
available to Parliament can be applied to uphold the validity of an Ordinance made by the

2. An Ordinance made by the President (or Governor) is not an executive but a legislative

3 It follows, therefore, that an Ordinance would offend against Art 21 if the procedure laid 
down by it in arbitrary or unreasonable'8  or It is not definite and reasonably ascertainable, or the 
precise extent of the deprivation of life or liberty by it is not cleaned in 0.16  
4. All the Entries in the Legislative List which are available to Parliament can be applied to 
uphold the validity of an Ordinance made by the Presdent.20  
5. An Ordinance can, therefore, create an offence2l or make or amend a tax law, 36,, to make 
a 'Money Bill', without complying with Arts. 109-110, because Parliament is not then in session, and 
because of the emergent conditions, the legislation can not be postponed until Parliament is in a 
position to sti.22  
6. Conversely, an Ordinance can not do what Parliament could not do by enacting an Act22  
7. When Parliament later sits and enacts a law, giving it retrospective effect since the issue of an 
Ordinance, it is futk to challenge the constitutional validity of the Ordinance because whatever has 
been done by the Ordinance is validated by the retrospective Act made by Parliament.24  
8. Just as the propriety of the exercise of a legislative power or the motives of the Legislature m 
passing a statute can not be questioned in a court of law, so also an Ordinance passed under Art. 
123 or 213 can not be questioned on the ground that the President (or the Governor) did not apply 
his mind to its provisions before passing 11.25  
Cr. (2) (a): 'Shall cease to operate at the expiration of six vreeks'.-The words 
'cease to operate' do not mean that the Ordinance shall be said an intik if resolutions disapproving 
It are passed by the Houses of the Legislature or it the Ordinance is not replaced by an Act of the 
legislature or the President (or the Governor as the case may be) does not lay it before the 
legislature as required by this sub-clanse.26  
On the other hand, since Cl. (2) says that an Ordinance shall have the same force as an Act of 
Parliament, the Ordinance shall take effect as soon as it is promulgated by the President (or the 
Governor, as the case may be) and that position can not be reversed unless the legislature passes an 
Act to the same effect, with retrospective effect, subject to constitutional limitations. A mere 
disapproval of an Ordinance can not revive closed or completed transactions. Thus, if certain posts 
are abolished by an Ordinance which ceases to operate under Cl. (2)(a), such posts can not be 
revived unless the legislature passes an Act to that effect or creates new posts of the like nature.26  
Similarly, where elections held are set aside by Court and an Ordinance is made validating those 
elections, the invalidity of the elections is not revived by the mere faci that the Ordinance lapse 
and is not replaced by an Act of the legisltaretits
