The Committee has identified 18 Central Acts suggested for repeal but recommended 
by the Committee for retention thereof at the present and . 
CHAPTER-2 
FEASIBILITY OF MINIMUM LAWS AND MAXIMUM GOVERNANCE 
A large number of laws always leads to a situation of conferring more discretion upon 
the enforcing agencies. In this connection, the Committee refers to the following extracts of 
an article titled "The Criminalisation of American business" published in "The Economist" 
dated the 30th August, 2014 (Refer Volume-I, Part-II, pages 402-405), namely:— 
"...When America was founded, there were only three specified federal crimes-
treason, counterfeiting and piracy. Now there are too many to count. In the most recent 
estimate, in the early 1990s, a law professor reckoned there were perhaps 300,000 regulatory 
statutes carrying criminal penalties-a number that can only have grown since then. 	
For 
financial firms especially, there are now so many laws, and they are so complex (witness the 
thousands of pages of new rules resulting from the Dodd-Frank Reforms), that enforcing them 
is becoming discretionary.". 
ENACTMENT OF LAWS BEFORE AND AFTER THE CONSTITUTION: 
A study of the Laws enacted as the Central Acts before the commencement of the 
Constitution and after the commencement of the Constitution till date was made by the 
Committee and details of the study are as under:—

TOTAL

From the above study, it can be observed that during 115 years before the 
commencement of the Constitution, 2911 Central Acts were enacted and thereafter during 66 
years i.e., after the commencement of the Constitution and till date, 3,701 Central Acts have 
been enacted. 
Legislation is the prerogative of the Legislatures i.e., the Parliament and State 
Legislatures. As per general practice adopted from the date of commencement of the 
Constitution, the Government Bills introduced in the Parliament are passed with or without 
modifications and after assent thereof by the Hon'ble President they are enacted as Central 
Acts. The Government Bills are introduced in the Parliament by the existing Central 
Government i.e., the Executive. 
The Committee feels that the issue of Governance by laws (i.e., Central Acts) vis-a-
vis exercise of Executive power needs to be re-visited in the light of provisions of the 
Constitution and today's socio-economic context which emphasises self-regulation and 
globalisation. 
*EXECUTIVE POWER OF THE UNION 
It may not be possible to frame an exhaustive definition of what executive function 
means and implies. Ordinarily, the executive power connotes the residue of governmental 
functions that remain after legislative and judicial functions are taken away subject, of course, 
to the provisions of the Constitution or of any law. 
The executive function comprises both the determination of the policy as well as 
carrying it into execution, the initiation of legislation, the maintenance of order, the promotion 
of social and economic welfare, the direction of foreign policy; in fact, the carrying on or 
supervision of the general administration of the State. It includes political and diplomatic 
activities. 
By reason of article 298, post, it also includes (a) the carrying on of trading operations; 
(b) the acquisition, holding and disposing of property; and (c) the making of contracts for any 
purpose. 
EXERCISE OF EXECUTIVE POWERS NOT DEPENDENT ON 
PRIOR LEGISLATION 
It is one of the functions of the Executive to execute the laws. This does not mean, 
however, that the executive function is confined to the execution of laws or that in order to 
enable the Executive to function in respect of any subject, there must be a law already in 
existence. Specific legislation, may, of course, be necessary to incur expenditure of the public 
funds or to encroach upon private rights, which cannot, under the Constitution, be done 
without legislation. But, apart from this, it cannot be held that in order to undertake any 
function, such as, entering into any trade or business, the Executive must obtain prior 
legislative sanction. 
6 
In the exercise of its executive power, therefore, a Government may do any act 
provided- 
(i) 
it is not an act assigned by the Constitution to any other authority or body such as the 
Legislature or the Judiciary or the Public Service Commission. 
(ii) It is not contrary to the provisions of the Constitution, or of any law. 
 
(iii) It does not encroach upon or otherwise infringe the legal rights of an individual. 
(iv) It does not involve payment of any money to any foreign power. 
(v) The powers required for carrying out a policy are not available from the existing law. 
(vi) Where the Constitution says that an act may be done only by legislation. 
In the absence of statutory provisions or statutory Rules or where such Rules are 
silent, it is competent for the Government, in the exercise of its executive power, to make 
administrative Rules, e.g., relating to conditions of service under the Government, and such 
non-statutory Rules shall to that extent be binding on the parties. 
EXTENT OF EXECUTIVE POWER OF THE UNION 
Attention is invited to article 73 of the Constitution. which read as under:— 
"73. (1) Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, the executive power of the Union 
shall extend- 
(a) to the matters with respect to which Parliament has power to make laws; and 
(b) to the exercise of such rights, authority and jurisdiction as are exercisable by 
the Government of India by virtue of any treaty or agreement: 
Provided that the executive power referred to in sub-clause (a) shall not, save as 
expressly provided in this Constitution or in any law made by Parliament, extend in 
any State to matters with respect to which the Legislature of the State has also 
power to make laws. 
(2) 	
Until otherwise provided by Parliament, a State and any officer or authority of 
a State may, notwithstanding anything in this article, continue to exercise in matters with 
respect to which Parliament has power to make laws for that State such executive power 
or functions as the State or Officer or authority thereof could exercise immediately before 
the commencement of this Constitution.". 
In view of the provisions of the Constitution, the Union shall have exclusive 
executive power for (a) the administration of laws made by Parliament under its exclusive 
powers; (b) the exercise of its treaty powers. 
By virtue of clause (1) (a) of article 73 of the Constitution, the executive power of the 
Union shall be co-extensive with the legislative power of the Union Parliament. 
In other words, it will extend over the whole of the Territory of India, with respect to 
the matters enumerated in Lists I and III of the 7th Schedule to the Constitution. But this 
7 
power is subject to the two exceptions engrafted in the proviso to clause (1) and clause (2) of 
article 73 of the Constitution. 
The proviso to clause (1) says that executive authority in regard to matters in the 
Concurrent List shall be ordinarily left to the States, for Parliament shall be entitled to provide 
that in exceptional 	
cases the executive power of the Union shall also extend to these 
subjects. If the Ministers are constantly under the fear or threat of being proceeded against in 
a court of law for even the slightest of lapse or under the constant fear of exemplary damages 
being awarded against them, they will develop a defensive attitude which would not be in the 
interest of administration. 
Apart from the provisions of articles 73 and 162 of the Constitution, Executive Power 
is conferred upon the Union as well as a State Government as regards three specified matters. 
(i) carrying on of any trade or business under article 298; 
(ii) acquisition, holding and disposal of property under article 298; 
(iii) making of contracts for any purposes under article 299. 
WHETHER SPECIFIC LEGISLATION IS REQUIRED 
FOR THE EXERCISE OF EXECUTIVE POWER 
RELATING TO A PARTICULAR SUBJECT 
The functions of the Executive are not confined to the execution of laws made by the 
Legislature and already in existence. Articles 73 and 162 indicate that the powers of the 
Executive of the Union and of a State are co-extensive with the legislative power of the Union 
and of a State, as the case may be. While the Executive cannot act against the provisions of a 
law, it does not follow that in order to enable the Executive to function relating to a particular 
subject, there must be a law already in existence, authorising such action. 
Once a law is passed, the executive power can be exercised only in accordance with 
such law so far as it goes, but the Government is not debarred from exercising its executive 
power merely because a Bill relating to the subject is pending before the Legislature. 
Legislation may, however, be required where the Constitution itself provides that the 
act can be done by legislation, e.g., for the imposition of tax as provided under article 265; for 
expenditure of money as provided under article 266(3); equality before law as provided under 
article 14; encroaching upon fundamental rights as provided under article 19(2)(6), protection 
of life and liberty as provided under article 21 or other legal rights as provided under article 
300A of the Constitution (Persons not to be deprived of property save by authority of law). 
In the Concurrent sphere, the Union will not have Executive Power, unless,— 
(a) the Constitution itself; or 
(b) a law made by Parliament, expressly provides to that effect. 
8 
It follows that in so far as the executive power which is specifically vested in the 
Union by Art 298 (carrying on of trade, disposal of property, and making of contracts) is 
concerned, it will not be governed by the proviso to article 73. 
POWER TO CHANGE EXECUTIVE ORDER OR POLICY 
Where the Constitution does not require an action to be taken only by legislation or 
there is no existing law to fetter the executive power of the Union (or a State, as the case may 
be), the Government would be not only free to take such action by an executive order or to lay 
down a policy for the making of such executive orders as occasion arises, but also to change 
such orders or the policy itself, as often as the Government so requires, subject to the 
following conditions: 
(a) Such change must be made in the exercise of a reasonable discretion, and not 
arbitrarily. 
(b) The making or changing of such order is made known to those concerned. 
(c) It complies with Art. 14, so that persons equally circumstanced are not treated 
unequally. 
(d) It would be subject to judicial review. 
Subject to the same conditions as above, the Government can review an executive or 
administrative order or relax the conditions of its policy. 
ENFORCEABILITY OF NON-STATUTORY 
ADMINISTRATIVE RULES OR ORDERS 
Though article 73 of the Constitution empowers the Government to issue rules or 
instructions, these must give way to provisions of any law or Rules made in exercise of the 
power conferred by article 309. Administrative instructions have no statutory effect on the 
operation of law and cannot override the same. 
*ITlease refer Volume I, Part II of this Report for extracts of Chapter V of the Book Titled as Shorter 
Constitution of India (Thirteenth Edition, 2002) of Durga Das Basu 1 
CONCLUSION: The expression "Executive Power" is very wide. It connotes the residue of 
governmental functions that remain after the legislative and judicial functions are taken away. 
It includes acts necessary for the carrying on or supervision of the general administration of 
the State, including both a decision as to action and the carrying out of the decision. 
The power of the State Executive are, no doubt, co-extensive with the legislative 
powers of the State Legislature but this does not mean that in order to enable the Executive to 
function in respect of any matter, there must be a law of the Legislature already in existence 
relating to that subject or that the powers of the executive are limited to the carrying out of 
those laws. The object of enactment by the Parliament on the subject List —III (Concurrent 
List) of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution may turn futile if the execution thereof left 
upon the State Governments. In this connection I-Ion'ble Shri (Dr.) B.R. Ambedkar during the 
9 
Constituent Assembly Debates** when the aforesaid article (corresponding article 60) before 
was taken for adoption, inter alia, observed as under:- 
	
Now, Sir, my second submission is that there is ample justification for a proviso of this 
sort, which permits the Centre in any particular case to take upon itself the administration of certain 
laws in the Concurrent list. Let me give one or two illustrations. The Constituent Assembly has 
passed article 11, which abolishes untouchability. It also permits Parliament to pass appropriate 
legislation to make the abolition of untouchability a reality. Supposing the Centre makes a law 
prescribing a certain penalty, certain prosecution for obstruction caused to the untouchables in the 
exercising of their civic rights. Supposing a law like that was made, and supposing that in any 
particular province the sentiment in favour of the abolition of untouchability is not as genuine and 
as intense nor is the Government interested in seeing that the untouchables have all the civic rights 
which the Constitution guarantees, is it logical, is it fair that the Centre on which so much 
responsibility has been cast by the Constitution in the matter of untouchability, should merely pass a 
law and sit with folded hands, waiting and watching as to what the Provincial Governments are 
doing in the matter of executing all those particular laws? As everyone will remember, the 
execution of such a law might require the establishing of additional police, special machinery for 
taking down, if the offence was made cognizable, for prosecution and for all costs of administrative 
matters without which the law could not be made good. Should not the Centre which enacts a law of 
this character have the authority to execute it? I would like to know if there is anybody who can say 
that on a matter of such vital importance, the Centre should do nothing more than enact a law. 
Let me give you another illustration. We have got in this country the practice of child marriage 
against which there has been so much sentiment and so much outcry. Laws have been passed by the 
Centre. They are left to be executed by the provinces. We all know what the effect has been as a 
result of this dichotomy between legislative authority resting in one Government and executive 
authority resting in the other. I understand (and I think my friend Pandit Bharagava who has been 
such a staunch supporter of this matter has been stating always in this House) that notwithstanding 
the legislation, child marriages are as rampant as they were. Is it not desirable that the Centre which 
is so much interested in putting down these evils should have some authority for executing laws of 
this character? Should it merely allow the provinces the liberty to do what they liked with the 
legislation made by Parliament with such intensity of feeling and such keen desire of putting it into 
effect? Take, for instance, another case--Factory Legislation. I can remember very well when I was  
the Labour Member of the Government of India cases after cases in which it was reported  
that  no Provincial Government or at least a good many of them were not prepared to establish  
Factory Inspectors and to appoint them in order to see that the Factory Laws were properly  
executed. Is it desirable that the labour legislations of the Central Government should be 
mere paper legislations with no effect given to them? How can effect be given to them unless  
the Centre has got some authority to make good the administration of laws which it makes? I 
therefore submit that having regard to the cases which I have cited--and I have no doubt honourable 
Members will remember many more cases after their own experience--that a large part of legislation 
which the Centre makes in the concurrent filed remains merely a paper legislation, for the simple 
reason that the Centre cannot execute its own laws. I think it is a crying situation which ought to be 
rectified which the proviso seeks to do.] 
There is one other point which I would like to mention and it is this. Really speaking, the 
Provincial Government sought to welcome this proviso because, there is a certain sort of financial 
anomaly in the existing position. For the Centre to make laws and leave to provinces the 
administrations means imposing certain financial burdens on the provinces which is involved in the 
employment of the machinery for the carrying out of those laws. When the Centre takes upon itself 
the responsibility of the executing of those laws, to that extent the provinces are relieved of any 
financial burden and I should have thought from that point of view this proviso should be a 
welcome additional relief which the provinces seek so badly. I therefore submit, Sir, that for the 
reasons I have given, the proviso contains a principle which this House would do well to endorse. 
(Cheers).

CHAPTER-3 
STATUS OF TOTAL NUMBER OF THE CENTRAL ACTS ENACTED DURING 
THE PERIOD BEGINNING FROM THE YEAR 1834 TO 15th OCTOBER, 2014 
AND EXISTING ON THE STATUTES BOOK 
While perusing the Central Acts and other material for the purpose of identifying the 
Central Acts for repeal or repeal and re-enactments thereof, the Committee felt the need for 
preparing the Status of the Central Acts enacted during the period beginning from the year 
1834 to 15th October, 2014 and existing on the Statutes Book in view of the following, 
namely:— 
1.1. The Commission on Review of Administrative Laws (herein after referred to as the 
P.C. Jain Commission) under the Chapter "INTRODUCTION" in paragraph 16.4.5, inter alio, 
stated that another reason for leaving a large number of enactments in the Statutes Book is 
that no systematic and regular attempt had been made to examine these Acts in depth for the 
purpose of repeal. The aforesaid Commission in paragraph 16.4.6, inter alia, stated as 
under:- 
"In view of the above position, we have an unenviable task of scanning the Acts and recommend 
the repeal of those Acts which are either not in force or anachronistic or not implemented and 
retained for some reason. We have accordingly gone through the list supplied by the Secretary, 
Legislative Department and after going through the provisions of some of the Acts, which we thought 
could no longer be retained in the Statute Book, prepared a list of Central Acts, which we feel, 
may safely be recommended for repeal.". 
1.2. 
The Law Commission in its 248th Report under Chapter 3 at paragraphs 3.3 and 3.4 
observed as under: 
"3.3 The Commission while pursuing the course of study also found that 34 laws which have already 
been repealed still figure on the Government Website (for details about these 34 laws please refer to 
Appendix - III). The Commission recommends that these laws may be removed from the Government 
Website. 
3.4 Similarly, the Commission notes that certain laws passed by Parliament are not listed in the 
Chronological List of Central Acts on the Government Website. A list of these laws can be seen at 
Appendix — IV. The Commission recommends that this oversight may also be corrected.". 
2. 	
The Committee noticed the certain discrepancies while referring to the material for its 
guidance some of which are as under: 	
 
2.1. 	
The Law Commission in its 248th Report have mentioned the Bengal Sessions 
Courts Act, 1871 (XIX of 1871) for further study at Si. No.65 of Appendix-V (LIST OF 
STATUTES FOR FURTHER STUDY WITH A VIEW TO ASSESS SUITABILITY FOR REPEAL) to the 
Report, to repeal the aforesaid Act. (Refer Volume IV, Part-II of this Report) The Law 
Commission in its 249th Report (Refer Volume IV, Part-II of this Report) recommended for 
repeal of the Bengal Sessions Courts Act, 1871 and observed as under:— 
11 
"The Act provided for the appointment of Sessions Judges for the territories respectively under the 
Governments of the Lieutenant-Governors of the Lower and North-Western Provinces of the Presidency 
of Fort William in Bengal. Although enacted by the Governor-General-in-Council pre-independence, it is 
now administered by the relevant State which also has the power to repeal or amend this law. Therefore, 
the Central Government should write to the concerned State Government recommending the review of 
this law by the State, with a view to repeal. The Central Government should also remove this law from 
its lists of central Acts in force.". 
The Bengal Sessions Courts Act, 1871(XIX of 1871) had already been repealed by 
the Third Schedule to the Repealing and Amending Act, 1903 (I of 1903) [Refer Sl.No.4 
of Volume I, Part-11 (pages 13 to 44)]. 
3. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for the repeal of the "Amending 
Act, 1901" at Sl. No.40 of Appendix A-1 to the Report (166 Central Acts recommended for 
repeal), whereas the title of the aforesaid Act as given in sub-section (1) of section 1 of Act 
XI of 1901 is the "Repealing and Amending Act, 1901". [Refer SI.No.3 of Volume I, Part-II 
(page 12)]. 
4. 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at 51. No. 60 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the "Amending Act, 1901" whereas the title of the 
aforesaid Act as given in sub-section (1) of section 1 of the Act XI of 1901 is the "Repealing 
and Amending Act, 1901 [Refer SI.No.3 of Volume I, Part-II (page 12)1". 
5. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for repeal of the Amending Act, 
1903 instead of the "Repealing and Amending Act, 1903 (1 of 1903) at Sl. No.41 of Appendix 
A-1(166 Central Acts recommended for repeal). 
6.

Report also recommended for repeal of the for repeal of the Amending Act, 1903 (1 of 1903) 
instead of the "Repealing and Amending Act, 1903 (I of 1903). 
7. 
The Law Commission in its 249th Report at SI. No's 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 17 stated that the 
text of Bengal Land Revenue Sales Act, Act 12 of 1841, Revenue, Bombay, Act 13 of 1842,

repeal. 
19. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No. 94 of its compendium of 100 laws [Refer

III, Part-1] has mentioned the title of the Act as "the Dock Workers (Safety Health and 
Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952". No such Act has been enacted in the year 1952. The 
14 
Committee feels that the title of the Act may be "the Dock Workers (Safety, Health and 
Welfare) Act, 1986 (54 of 1986)". 
21. 
In view of the above, the Committee undertook the task of perusing all the Acts from 
the year 1834 onwards to the year 2014i-except the Madras Rent and Revenue Sales Act, 1839 
(VII of 1839) for the purpose of identifying the Central Acts for repeal and Central Acts 
which would require re-visiting in the present socio-economic environment and re-enactment 
thereof or which would not require repeal at present and prepared status of all the Central 
Acts enacted from the year 1834 to till date existing on the Statutes Book [Refer Volume II]. 
The Legislative Department vide its O.M. No.1(2)12014-Con. dated the 18th September, 
2014 [Refer Sl.No.22 of Volume III, Part-11] has stated that the of copy of the Madras Rent 
and Revenue Sales Act, 1839 (VII of 1839) was not printed in the relevant book and therefore 
is not available and therefore this Act could not be perused. 
22. 
For the purposes of preparing the status of Central Acts enacted from the year 1834 
to till date existing on the Statutes Book, it would be relevant to draw the attention in respect 
of the meaning of the Central Act; and the reasons for perusal of the Central Act from the 
year 1834 till date. 
MEANING OF CENTRAL ACT: The term 'Central Act' have been defined under clause 
(7) of section 3 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 which reads as under:- 
"(7) 'Central Act' shall mean an Act of Parliament, and shall include— 
(a) an Act of the Dominion Legislature or of the Indian Legislature passed before the 
commencement of the Constitution, and 
(b) an Act made before such commencement by the Governor General in Council or the 
Governor General, acting in a legislative capacity.". 
Clause (7) of section 3 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 becomes relevant n terms of 
article 367 of the Constitution which reads under:- 
"367. Interpretation.—(1) Unless the context otherwise requires, the General Clauses Act, 1897, shall, 
subject to any adaptation and modifications that may be made therein under article 372, apply for the 
interpretation of this Constitution as it applies for the interpretation of an Act of Legislature of the 
Dominion of India. 
(2) Any reference in this Constitution to Acts or laws of, or made by, Parliament, or to Acts or 
laws of, or made by, the Legislature of a State, shall be construed as including a reference to an 
Ordinance made by the President or, to an Ordinance made by a Governor, as the case may be. 
(3)For the purposes of this Constitution 'foreign State' means any State other than India: 
Provided that subject to the provisions of any law made by Parliament, the President may by 
order declare any State not to be a foreign State for such purposes as may be specified in the order.". 
The Constitution Amendment Acts have been indicated in the Master copy (Set No. 
29) of the Central Acts, but they have not given the Act numbers. A reference was made vide 
PMO ID. No. CRA/1/2014/2 dated the 3rd September, 2014 (Refer Annexure-III to Part-1 of 
this Volume) to the Department of Legal Affairs in the Ministry of Law and Justice on the 
issue as to whether the Constitution Amendment Acts can be construed as a 'Central' Act or 
15 
not. The advice of the Department of Legal Affairs on the date of Report is awaited and 
therefore, the Constitution Amendment Acts have not been included in the Status of the 
Central Acts prepared by the Committee. 
23. 	
The status of the Central Acts enacted during the period beginning from the year 
1834 to 15th October, 2014 and existing on the Statutes Book have been prepared and given 
in Volume II of the Report indicating— 
(a) the details of each Central Act enacted in each year beginning from the year 1834 
to 15th October, 2014; 
(b) the details of each Central Act which had repealed indicating the reference by 
which the Central Acts had been repealed; 
(c) the total number of Central Acts enacted in a calendar year indicating the status of 
such Central Acts against them i.e., whether existing on the Statutes Book or repealed; 
(d) total number of Central Acts enacted during the period beginning from the year 
1834 to 15th October, 2014 and existing on the Statutes Book. 
24. 	
Briefly, the status of the Central Acts as indicated in Volume II of the Report is

CHAPTER-4 
(ACTS IDENTIFIED FOR REPEAL) 
The Committee perused the Central Acts beginning from the year 1834 to till date to 
identify for repeal in view of the dictum that Statute never dies unless specifically repealed. 
In this connection, the Committee draws attention to paragraph 16.4.9 of the P.C. Jain 
Commission Report which, inter alio, reads as under:— 
"16.4.9. The scheme for legislation in India is, inter-alia, based on the dictum that a Statute never dies 
unless specifically repealed. This has resulted in a situation where Statutes which are even more than 
100 years old, as also the Statutes which were enacted for a temporary purpose/period have continued to 
exist in the Statute Books.". 
2. 	
There does not exist a uniform legislative practice to repeal the Central Acts existing 
on the Indian Statutes Book. During the perusal of the Indian Statutes Book from the year 
1834 to till date, the Committee found that Statutes existing on the Indian Statutes Book have 
been repealed by various modes, namely:— 
(a) by a Central Act for the purpose of repeal of a particular Central Act; 
(b) repealing one or more Central Acts (hereafter referred to as former Acts), by 
incorporating a substantive section for repeal of the former Act in another Central Act; 
(c) repealing Central Acts by Schedule appended to another Central Act; 
(d) repealing Central Acts by the Central Acts titled as the "Repealing Acts" or the 
"Repealing and Amending Acts" enacted from time to time; 
(e) repealing a Central Act by a State Act in certain cases (where the Parliament acquires 
legislative competence to enact on a subject falling under List-II-State List of the Seventh 
Schedule to the Constitution, which ceases upon efflux of time or restoration of the State 
Legislatures or by a resolution by two States etc.); and 
(f) deeming repeal of a Central Act in pursuance of provisions of that Central Act in 
pursuance notifications issued there under. The legislative precedents falling under sub-
paragraph (e) are given as under:— 
(i) the Indian Lac Cess Act, 1930 (XXIV of 1930) was deemed to have been 
repealed by issue of notification number S.O. 881 dated 18th March, 1966 under 
section 7 of the said Act; 
(ii) the Indian Cotton Cess Act, 1923 (XIV of 1923) was deemed to have been 
repealed by issue of notification number S.O. 882 dated 18th March, 1966 under 
section 14 of the said Act; 
(iii) the Indian Coconut Committee Act, 1944 (10 of 1944) was deemed to have been 
repealed by issue of notification number S.O. 883 dated 18th March, 1966 under 
section 17 of the said Act; and 
17 
(iv) the Indian Oil-seeds Committee Act, 1946 (9 of 1946) was deemed to have been 
repealed by issue of notification number S.O. 884 dated 18th March, 1966 under 
section 16 of the said Act. 
3. 	
In order to identify the Central Acts for repeal under this Chapter, the Committee 
decided to peruse all Central Acts enacted from the year 1834 to till date i.e., up to October, 
2014 and include under this Chapter the following categories of Central Acts, namely:- 
(i) the Central Acts which are very old and have become obsolete or redundant in today's 
socio-economic context; 
(ii) the Central Acts enacted before independence which relate to the matters pertaining to 
one specific individual or his descendants; 
(iii) the Central Acts which exist on Statutes Book as they contain one or more validation 
or saving provision or transitional provisions; 
(iv) the Central Acts which exist on Statutes Book as they contain one section being the 
short title and commencement; 
(v) the Central Acts exist on Statutes Book even after expiry of the period of their 
applicability or validity provided in such Acts; 
(vi) the Central Acts (being an amendment Act) which exist on the Statutes Book even 
after repeal of the principal legislations, to which amendments were made by such 
amendment Act; and 
(vii) the amending Central Acts which have become redundant in pursuance of provisions 
contained in section 6A of the General Clauses Act, 1897, which reads as under:— 
"6A. Repeal of Act making textual amendment in Act or Regulation.- Where any Central Act 
or Regulation made after the commencement of this Act repeals any enactment by which the text 
of any Central Act or Regulation was amended by the express omission, insertion or substitution of 
any matter, then, unless a different intention appears, the repeal shall not affect the continuance of 
any such amendment made by the enactment so repealed and in operation at the time of such 
repeal.". 
3.1. An amending Central Act (making amendments to the principal Act) becomes redundant 
in pursuance of section 6A of the General Clauses Act, 1897, when all the provisions of such 
amending Central Act have come into force and it does not contain any validation or saving 
provision or transitional provisions. In order to include the Central Amending Acts for repeal 
under this Chapter, the Committee perused the commencement date of all the amending 
Central Acts. Attention is drawn to the provisions relating the commencement of a Central 
Act, which are broadly summarised as under:— 
3.2. A Central Act comes into force — 
(i) on the date specified in the Central Act itself for coming into force of such Act; 
or 
18 
(ii) on the date or dates on which, the Central Government may, in pursuance of 
the power conferred upon it], bring such Central Act into force (either all or part of 
the provisions of such Act) by notification published in the Official Gazette. 
(iii) when no date for coming into force has been specified in the Central Act, on 
the date of assent of the President in pursuance of section 5 of the General Clauses 
Act, 1897 which reads as under:— 
"5. Coming into operation of enactments.- (1) Where any Central Act is not expressed to 
come into operation on a particular day, then it shall come into operation on the day on 
which it receives the assent,- 
(a) in the case of a Central Act made before the commencement of the 
Constitution, of the Governor- General, and 
(b) in the case of an Act of Parliament, of the President. 
(2) Omitted. 
(3) Unless the contrary is expressed, a Central Act or Regulation shall be 
construed as coming into operation immediately on the expiration of the day preceding its 
commencement.". 
3.3. 	
The P.C. Jain Commission in its Report at paragraph 16.4 6 has recommended that all 
the validation Acts can be repealed after providing saving clauses wherever necessary. The 
Committee has given model drafts of such saving clauses (where ever necessary) 
incorporated in the Model Draft Repealing Bill, 2014 given under Chapter-8 of this Report, 
(which may be adopted after making of such changes of drafting in nature or correction of 
factual error or patent error, if any) as may be considered necessary by the Legislative 
Department. The Validation Acts have been repealed earlier also. [See the Manipur Court-
fees (Amendment and Validation) Act, 1953, repealed by Act No. 22 of 2001 and the U.P. 
Sugarcane Cess (Validation) Act, 1961 repealed by Act No. 17 of 2001]. 
4. 
The Committee has identified under this Chapter total 760 Central Acts for repeal 
(wholly or partly) as mentioned under Part-I, Part-IL Part-III and Part-IV of this Chapter. 
5. 
The Central Acts (655 No.'s) mentioned under Part-I of this Chapter and 624 Central 
Appropriation Acts identified for repeal and mentioned under Chapter-6 have been included 
in the Model Draft Repealing Bill, 2014 given in Chapter-8 which, if considered appropriate, 
may be adopted, after making such changes of drafting in nature or correction of factual or 
patent errors, if any. The model draft Bill contains 1279 Central Acts identified for repeal. 
6. 
Part-II under this Chapter consists of Central Acts identified to be repealed after 
consultation with the concerned Ministry/Department. These Acts may be included in the 
Repealing Bill, 2014 after incorporation necessary saving provision or validation provision or 
transitory provisions in respect of provisions in such Central Acts, as may be considered 
appropriate consultation with the Ministry/Department concerned. 
7. 
Part-III under this Chapter consists of Central Acts relating to Acquisition and 
Transfer of Undertakings/Acquisition of shares/Takeover of management/Nationalisation 
which have been identified for repeal and to be included in the Repealing Bill, 2014 after 
incorporation necessary saving provision or validation provision or transitory provisions in 
19 
respect of provisions in such Central Acts, as may be considered appropriate in consultation 
with the concerned Ministry/Department. 
8. 
It may be appropriate to draw attention to the judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme 
Court in the matter of Centre for Public Interest Litigation Vs. Union of India, 
wherein it was held that that the sale of shares of HPCL could not take place through 
executive order, since the formation of HPCL had taken place through acquisition statues, 
including the Caltex [Acquisition of Shares of Caltex Oil Refining (India) Limited and of the 
Undertakings in India of Caltex (India) Limited] Act, 1977. For the sale of its shares, either 
Parliamentary approval would have to be obtained, or the acquisition statutes, including this 
one, would have to be repealed. In view of the observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, 
the acquisition statutes can be repealed. 
9. 
Part-IV under this Chapter consists of Central Acts relating to Central Acts relating to 
imposition of Cess which have been identified for repeal and to be included in the Repealing 
Bill, 2014 after incorporation necessary saving provision or validation provision or transitory 
provisions in respect of provisions in such Central Acts, as may be considered appropriate in 
consultation with the concerned Ministry/Department. The Central Acts, as per the 
information available on the internet and print media, it appears that the revenue generated by 
imposition of Cess is not very substantial. The repeal of Central Acts relating to imposition 
of Cess would help simplification of laws. The Welfare Funds [which were financed by the 
levy of Cess] for workers of the various sectors continue to exist by financing through 
executive measures. 
10. 
After inclusion of the Central Acts specified in the preceding paragraph, the total 
Central Acts identified for repeal would come to 777 Nos. (excluding the Central Acts 
identified for repeal on the State subjects). 
PART-I 
1. Revenue Bombay (XIII of 1842) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to enable the holders of Revenue which has been 
alienated to them by the State, to collect that Revenue within the Presidency of Bombay. The 
aforesaid Act was passed by the Hon'ble the President of the Council of India in Council, on 
the 28th of October, 1842, with the assent of the Right Hon'ble the Governor General of India. 
As per the records available, the aforesaid Act has been partially repealed by Part-I of 
Schedule to Act 16 of 1874 and repealed locally by Bombay Act 5 of 1879. Since, it has been 
repealed by the Bombay Act 5 of 1879, and therefore has become redundant in its application 
and object. 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at Sl. No. 5 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act in consultation with relevant 
State(s). Law Commission observed that in this case, the text of the Act is not available on the 
Law Ministry's website, or from any other readily available source, an indication that it is not 
in use. As already mentioned, since land revenue falls under List II of the Seventh Schedule, 
20 
the concerned State legislature is the competent legislature for repeal of this Act. Therefore, 
the Central Government should write to the concerned State Government recommending the 
review of this law by the State, with a view to repeal. The Central Government should also 
remove this law from its lists of central Acts in force. The Law Commission further observed 
in the Report that this Act has also been recommended for repeal by the P.C. Jain Commission 
(Appendix A-5). 
The Committee could not get reference of the recommendation of the P.C. Jain 
Commission in its Report for repealing the Revenue Bombay (XIII of 1842). 
The Committee after perusing the aforesaid Act from the Central Acts made available 
to this Committee by the Legislative Department, feels that since the aforesaid Act has been 
repealed locally by Bombay Act 5 of 1879 and has become redundant in its application and 
object, but still this Act remains on the Statute Book. Therefore the same is required to be 
repealed. 
In view of the position stated at paragraphs 3 to 7 of Chapter-5, the Committee 
feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
2. Revenue Commissioners, Bombay (XVII of 1842) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted relating to number and powers of the Revenue 
Commissioners under the Presidency of Bombay. The aforesaid Act was passed by the 
Hon'ble the President of the Council of India in Council, on the 16th of December, 1842, with 
the assent of the Right Honible the Governor General of India. 
As per the records made available to the Committee by the Legislative Department, 
the aforesaid Act has been partially repealed by Act 14 of 1870 and repealed locally by 
Bombay Act 5 of 1879. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has recommended for its repeal at SI. No.86 of Appendix 
A-5 (114 Central Acts relating to State subjects), which is still in force. 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at Sl. No. 6 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act in consultation with relevant State(s) 
referring to the earlier recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission 
observed that this is another law whose text is not readily available. Neither are there any 
other indications that the Act is in use. However, the competent legislature for repeal of this 
Act is the relevant State legislature. Therefore, the Central Government should write to the 
concerned State Government recommending the review of this law by the State, with a view to 
repeal. The Central Government should also remove this law from its lists of central Acts in 
force. 
In view of the position stated at paragraphs 3 to 7 of Chapter-5, the Committee 
feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
3. The Public Accountants' Defaults Act, 1850 (XII of 1850) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted, inter alia,-- 
(i) 
for public Accountants to give security for due performance of duties, 
(ii) 
if not regulated by the aforesaid Act, for the security to be such as may be 
required by person appointing the Accountant, 
(iii) 
defining who shall be deemed a Public Accountant, 
(iv) 
proceeding against a Public Accountant in arrear and his securities may be 
proceeded against as for land revenue in arrear and all regulations for 
recovery of land revenue to apply to the case, 
(v) 
summary sales of land before this Act, made valid sub moto its application 
in the present day scenario. 
21 
Section III of the aforesaid Act provides that every person is a public Accountant 
within the meaning of this Act, who, by reason of any office held by him in the service of the 
East India Company is entrusted with the receipt, custody or control of any moneys or 
securities for money, or the management of any lands belonging to the East India Company, 
or as Official Assignee or Trustee, or as Surberakar, or in any other official capacity, with the 
receipt, custody or control of any moneys or securities for money, or the management of any 
lands belonging to any other person or persons. 
The aforesaid Act was passed on the 22" March, 1850. 
The aforesaid Act has been partially repealed by Act 14 of 1870, and repealed 
locally by Bombay Act 5 of 1879 and also repealed in Assam by Regulation 1 of 1886. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act has become 
redundant and can be repealed. 
4. The Caste Disabilities Removal Act, 1850 (XXI of 1850) 
The aforesaid Act inter alio provides that "whenever in any civil suit, the parties to 
such suit may be of different persuasions, when one party shall be of the Hindu and the other 
of the Muhammadan persuasion, or where one or more of the parties to the suit shall not be 
either of the Muhammadan or Hindu persuasions, the laws of those religions shall not be 
permitted to operate to deprive such party or parties of any property to which, but for the 
operation of such laws, they would have been entitled;" and whereas it will be beneficial to 
extend the principle of that enactment throughout the territories subject to the Government of 
the East India Company. The aforesaid Act was passed on the 11th April, 1850. 
The P.C. Jain Commission in its Report has included the aforesaid Act at Sl.No. 2 of 
Appendix-D. The Commission observed that there are number of personal laws applicable to 
some religions and communities. Some of these may not be relevant now and are also indeed 
very old. The perception of the concerned religion or community would be relevant for their 
updating/codification/repeal. The Commission recommends that further action be taken 
accordingly in respect of the aforesaid Act. 
The Legislative Department vide their D.O. No. 11(29)/2014-L.Idated 12th September, 
2014 at Sl. No. 20 of the Annexure attached thereto stated that the aforesaid Act is required to 
be repealed in the light of changing socio- economic environment. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act is obsolete and can be repealed. 
5. The Public Servants (Inquiries) Act, 1850 (XXXVII of 1850) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted for regulating inquiries into the behaviour of Public 
Servants. 	
The aforesaid Act was titled as "the Public Servants (Inquiry) Act, 1850" by 
section 1 of Act I of 1897. The aforesaid Act was passed on the 1st November, 1850. 
Attention is invited to section 2 of the Public Servants (Inquiry) Act, 1850 which reads 
as under:— 
Tin. Whenever the Government shall be of opinion that there are good grounds for making a formal and 
public inquiry into the truth of any imputation of misbehaviour by any person in the service of the East 
India Company not removable from his Office without the sanction of the same Government, it shall 
cause the substance of the imputations to be drawn into distinct Articles of Charge, and shall order a 
formal and public inquiry to be made into the truth thereof". 
The Public Servants (Inquiry) Act, 1850 has been partially repealed by Act XIV of 
1870, Act XVI of 1874, Act XII of 1876 and (locally by Act XVI of 1868). As per the records 
made available to the Committee by the Legislative Department, it is observed that section II 
of the Public Servants (Inquiry) Act, 1850 is still in force. 
The Civil Servants are governed by the laws made after the independence i.e., the 
22 
Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965, the All India Services 
(Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1969, the Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1964, the 
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (49 of 1988), the Central Vigilance Commission Act, 2003 (45 of 
2003) and the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013 (1 of 2014). 
In view of the above, the Public Servants (Inquiry) Act, 1850 has become obsolete 
and redundant. The Committee feels that the Public Servants (Inquiry) Act, 1850 can be 
repealed. 
6. The Sheriffs Fees Act, 1852 (VIII of 1852) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted for remunerating the Sheriffs of Calcutta, Madras 
and Bombay, for the execution of Mofussil Process under Act XXIII of 1840, which has been 
repealed by the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1882 (10 of 1882). The aforesaid Act was passed 
on the 6th February, 1852. 
The Law Commission in its 248th Report at SI. No. 5 under Chapter 4 of the Report 
has recommended for repeal of this Act (without mentioning the necessity of consultation with 
the relevant State). 
The Law Commission in its Report has observed that the aforesaid Act was enacted to 
remunerate Sheriffs of the presidency towns of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras, at a time when 
Sheriffs executed legal processes issued by courts. Now, Sheriffs do not exercise judicial or 
executive functions. They perform an apolitical, non-executive role and preside over various 
city-related functions and conferences. Sheriffs are now not paid by the Central Government. 
Most provisions of the aforesaid Act have been repealed. The only operative section is section 
8, which deals with the liability of the Sheriffs in case persons taken for execution escape. 
This is no longer relevant since Sheriffs now enjoy only a ceremonial position in the 
administrative hierarchy. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No.2 of its compendium of 100 laws to be repealed 
inter alia stated that all the provisions of the 1852 Act were repealed by means of an 
Amending Order in 1937. Only Section 8 now remains, which deals with the liability of the 
Sheriffs in case persons taken for execution were to escape. Since Sheriffs now enjoy only a 
titular position in the administrative hierarchy and do not perform any judicial functions, this 
liability of the Sheriff is no longer relevant. The aforesaid Act was enacted by the Governor 
General in Council, per the administrative structure of the British government. Sheriffs are 
now remunerated by the concerned Municipal Corporations in all the three cities and thus, 
remuneration of sheriffs is the prerogative of the State Governments. There is no documented 
use of this Act. 
The Legislative Department vide their D.O. No. 11(29)/2014-L.I dated 12th 
September, 2014 at Si. No. 8 of the Annexure appended thereto, stated that the aforesaid Act 
is required to be repealed, as it is outdated Law. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
7. The Oriental Gas Company Act, 1857 (V of 1857) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to confer certain powers on the Oriental Gas 
Company Limited, which has ceased to exist now. The aforesaid Act was enacted by the 
Legislative Council of India and received the assent of the Governor General on the 13th 
February, 1857. By efflux of time, this Act has become obsolete and needs to be repealed. The 
P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for its repeal at Si. No.28 of Appendix A-1 (166 
Central Acts for repeal), which is still in force. The 10th Law Commission in its 96th Report 
inter alia observed that Government may consider if this Act, and also the analogous later Act 
of 1867, are needed at all. After verification of the factual position, further action may be 
23 
taken. Again 20th Law Commission in its Report at serial No.8 under Chapter 4 classified the 
aforesaid Act under the Category "Energy Laws" and recommended for repeal in consultation 
with relevant State. 
The P.C. Jain Commission at Si. No. 28 of Appendix A-1, recommended for repeal of 
the aforesaid Act without mentioning for consultation with the State Government. But, the 
Law Commission in its aforesaid recommendation recommended for repeal in consultation 
with the relevant State as the aforesaid Act was enacted to confer certain powers on the 
Oriental Gas Company (OGC), such as the power to lay down pipes in Calcutta for the 
purpose of manufacturing, supplying and distributing fuel gas. OGC was originally an English 
Company, which has now ceased to exist. It was taken over by the State of West Bengal and 
merged with a larger public utility company. The original 1857 Act serves no purpose now. 
Whereas, there is unanimous opinion amongst the P C Jain Commission and the Law 
Commission and the Committee to repeal the aforesaid Act, there appears to be difference on 
the issue of consultation with the relevant State. The P C Jain Commission did not recommend 
for consultation with relevant State for repealing the aforesaid Act and listed the aforesaid Act 
in Appendix A-1, i.e., under the category of 166 Central Acts to be repealed. The Law 
Commission recommended repeal of the Act in consultation with the relevant State. 
The Committee feels that the subject of the Act to be repealed is relatable to entries 43, 
44 and 53 of List -I (Union List) of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, which reads as 
under: 	
 
[Entry 43. Incorporation, regulation and winding up of trading corporations, including banking, insurance 
and financial corporations, but not including co-operative societies. 
Entry 44. Incorporation, regulation and winding up of corporations, whether trading or not, with objects 
not confined to one State, but not including universities. 
Entry 53. Regulation and development of oilfields and mineral oil resources; petroleum and petroleum 
products; other liquids and substances declared by Parliament by law to be dangerously inflammable.] 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No.2 of its compendium of 100 laws to be repealed 
inter alia stated that the Oriental Gas Company has ceased to exist, making this legislation 
obsolete and irrelevant. After Independence, the West Bengal Government enacted the 
Oriental Gas Company Act, 1960, with the objective of taking over the Company on the 
grounds that the Company, which enjoyed a monopoly in the supply of gas in Calcutta, was 
not serving consumers properly. Under this Act, the State Government took over the 
management of the Company for a period of five years. However, two years later, it was 
permanently acquired and renamed as Oriental Gas Company Undertaking (OGCU). In 1990, 
OGCU was taken over by a public incorporated company called Greater Calcutta Gas Supply 
Corporation Limited (GCGSCL), which is fully owned by the West Bengal Government. The 
Law Commission in its 96th Report (1984) (Chapter 3, Page 12) recommended repeal of this 
Act on the grounds that it is redundant, since the Company itself has ceased to exist. 
The Committee is inclined to go with the recommendations of the P C Jain 
Commission for repeal of the aforesaid Act. 
8.The Madras Uncovanented Officers Act, 1857 (VII of 1857) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted for more extensive employment of uncovenented 
agency in the Revenue and Judicial Departments in the Presidency of Fort Saint George. The 
aforesaid Act was enacted by the Legislative Council of India and received the assent of the 
Governor General on the 1st May, 1857. The aforesaid Act in its application was repealed in 
the State of Tamil Nadu by Mad Act. 36 of 1955 and therefore has become redundant in its 
application and object. 
The P.C. Jain Commission in its Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid 
24 
said at SI. No. 65 of Appendix A-5 i.e., 114 Central Acts for repeal by the State Governments. 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th Report has classified the aforesaid Act 
under the category "Government Employees" and recommended for the repeal of the aforesaid 
Act at 51. No.10 under Chapter 4 of its Report without mentioning requirement of consultation 
with the relevant State (whereas the Law Commission has specifically mentioned consultation 
with relevant State for repealing certain Acts in the aforesaid Report). The Law Commission 
further observed that the aforesaid Act was enacted to provide for the more extensive 
employment of uncovenanted officers in the Revenue and Judicial Departments in the 
Presidency of Fort St. George. The distinction between 'covenanted' and `uncovenanted' 
officers does not prevail within hierarchy of officers in the Indian Civil Services now. This 
was an old division of Indian officers between those who were appointed under a covenant 
with the British Government, and those who were not. This classification of officers came to 
an end as a result of the Public Service Commission of 1886. Also, there is no documented use 
of this Act. Hence, this Act is obsolete. 
The Committee feels that since the aforesaid Act has been repealed locally by Madras 
Act 36 of 1955 and has therefore become redundant in its application and object, but still this 
Act exit on the Statute Book. 
The Committee is inclined to go with the recommendations of the Law 
Commission of India for repeal of the aforesaid Act 
9. The Howrah Offences Act, 1857 (XXI of 1857) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to make better provision for the order and good 
government of the suburbs of Calcutta and of the Station of Howrah. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for its repeal at SI. No.48 of 
Annexure A-5 of its Report (114 Central Acts to be repealed by the State Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th  Report at SI. No.11 under Chapter 4 had 
recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. It has been observed that the aforesaid Act was 
enacted to prescribe penalties for various offences committed within the limits of Howrah, a 
suburb of Calcutta where the iconic Howrah Station is located. However, the Act lays down 
relatively insignificant sentences and fines while the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and other 
criminal laws have stricter penalties for the same offences. This Act has not been used in the 
recent past, with the last recorded case being in 1956. While this Act is redundant, concerns 
remain about its use as a legal escape route to avoid more stringent penalties under the IPC (or 
some other law). The Law Commission has not mentioned consultation with the relevant 
State. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No. 4 of its compendium of 100 laws to be repealed 
inter alia, stated that the offences mentioned in this Act are punishable under the Indian Penal 
Code, 1860 and other criminal laws and in fact, the punishments for these offences under this 
Act are paltry, while the IPC has relatively stricter penalties, for instance, possession of stolen 
property is punishable with imprisonment for three months under this Act, while the IPC 
stipulates imprisonment for three years along with a fine, and hence, the Act hardly serves as a 
deterrent. It further stated that there is no indication of any recent use of this Act and however, 
the Act could be used as a legal loophole to escape the harsher penalties of the IPC (or some 
other law),It also stated that the maintenance and safety of the Howrah station is now the 
function of the Indian Railways and falls under the Eastern Railway zone. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act is relatable to the legislative power of the 
Parliament conferred upon it under entry 2 of List-III-Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule 
to the Constitution which reads as under:- 
"2.Criminal procedure, including all matters included in the Code of Criminal Procedure at the 
commencement of this Constitution.". 
25 
In view of the above, the aforesaid Act has become irrelevant and obsolete in the 
present day scenario and can be repealed. 
10. The Calcutta Pilots Act, 1859 (XII of 1859) 
The aforesaid Act provides to make better provision for the trial of Pilots at the 
Presidency of Fort Williams in Bengal for breach of duty. The aforesaid Act was passed by 
the Legislative Council of India and received the assent of the Governor General on the 4th 
May, 1859. 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th Report at Si. No.12 under Chapter 4 of the 
Report observed that the aforesaid Act envisages setting up a Court for the trial of pilots, who 
were employed in the Hooghly Pilot Service of the Port of Calcutta, and were accused of 
breach of duty. However, there is no evidence of Courts being set up or cases reported under 
this Act. The Hooghly Pilot Service has been amalgamated into the Calcutta Pilot Service, 
which has its own set of regulations. Therefore, this Act is redundant. The Law Commission 
recommended repeal of the aforesaid Act without mentioning the requirement of consultation 
with the relevant State (whereas the Law Commission has specifically mentioned consultation 
with relevant State for repealing certain Acts in the aforesaid Report). 
The aforesaid Act has become irrelevant and obsolete in the present context and 
can be repealed. 
11. The Stage Carriages Act, 1861 (XVI of 1861) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted by the Legislative Council of India and received the 
assent of the Governor General on the 7th July, 1861. The aforesaid Act provides for licensing 
and regulating the Stage Carriages, drawn by one or more horses for the purpose of conveying 
passengers for hire to or from any place. The aforesaid Act provides to licensing and to 
regulate Stage Carriages in India which means it extended to whole of India and not to a 
particular State. 
The P.C. Jain Commission in its Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid 
said at Si. No. 96 of Appendix A-5 i.e., Central Acts to be repealed by the State Governments. 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at Sl. No. 27 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act in consultation with relevant State(s) 
referring to the earlier recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission 
observed that the aforesaid Act provided for the compulsory licensing of stage carriages by the 
Magistrate or the Commissioner of Police for their use in the Presidency Towns. Stage 
carriage, for the purposes of this Act, was defined as a carriage drawn by one or more horses 
ordinarily used for the purpose of conveying passengers for hire. States now have more 
modern rules to govern the licensing of stage carriages. In Mumbai, for example, carriages (as 
defined under this Act), known as Victoria's, are licensed under the Bombay Public 
Conveyances Act, 1920, and not under this Act. Consequently, the Act has fallen into disuse. 
States such as Karnataka have already repealed this Act for the reason that this is a 'spent' 
Act. Therefore, the Central Government should write to the other concerned State 
Governments recommending the review of this law with a view to repeal. 
By efflux of time, the aforesaid Act has become obsolete. Since the aforesaid Act 
extends to whole of India, the committee feels that the aforesaid can be repealed. 
In view of the position stated at paragraphs 3 to 7 of Chapter-5, and since it 
extends to whole of India, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
12. The Government Seal Act, 1862 (III of 1862) 
26 
The aforesaid Act was enacted by the Legislative Council of India and received the 
assent of the Governor General on the 27th February, 1862. The aforesaid Act relates to the 
law relating to the use of a Government seal, which is still in force. The aforesaid Act 
empowered the use of seal by the Local Government to be used, in the place of the seal of East 
India Company. 
The Law Commission in its one hundred and forty-eighth Report has opined that they 
cannot recommend its repeal. The Law Commission of India in its 248th Report has 
recommended for its repeal at SI. No.13 under Chapter 4 of the Report. The Act was enacted 
to remove all doubts about the use of seals for certification of certain documents. It allowed 
the Seal of the local government to be used in place of the Seal of the East India Company. 
The aforesaid Act was considered for repeal by the 148th Law Commission Report, 
1993. The Report noted that documents and instruments sealed in accordance with this Act 
might have given rise to certain rights and liabilities which have been accepted and undertaken 
by the Government of India/State Government under Articles 294 and 295 of the Constitution. 
While the Law Commission did not recommend repeal of this Act, with a savings clause 
validating documents sealed under this Act, this Act may be validly repealed, since the 
situation of documents requiring seals of the East India Company can no longer arise. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act may be repealed after incorporating 
saving clause on the following lines, namely:-- 
"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in section 4, the repeal of the 
Government Seal Act, 1862 shall not affect the validity of any instruments or documents 
executed before or after the 20th February, 1862 on which a seal had been affixed on behalf 
of Local Authority bearing designation of such Local Authority or the inscription 
"Government of India" instead of the seal of the East India Company.". 
13. The Convert's Marriage Dissolution Act, 1866 (XXI of 1866) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to legalize, under certain circumstances, the dissolution 
of marriages of native converts to Christianity. The aforesaid Act was enacted by the 
Governor-General of India in Council and received the assent of the Governor General on the 
2nd April, 1866. 
The P.C. Jain Commission in paragraph 16.4.6 of the Report have stated that there are 
a number of personal laws mentioned at SI. No.12 in Appendix-D appended to its report 
applicable to some religions and communities. Some of these may not be relevant now and 
indeed very old. The perception of the concerned religion would be relevant for their 
updating/codification/repeal. The P.C. Jain Commission recommended that further action be 
taken accordingly. 
The Law Commission in its 248th Report at 51. No. 16 under Chapter 4 of its Report 
had recommended for the repeal of the aforesaid Act (without mentioning the necessity of 
consultation with the relevant State). The Law Commission observed that the aforesaid Act 
was enacted to allow the dissolution of marriages of converts from Hinduism to Christianity, 
on the grounds that they have been deserted or repudiated on religious grounds by spouse. It 
enables divorce proceedings to be initiated by the converted person, not his or her spouse. The 
scope of the Act was first considered in the 18th Law Commission Report (1960) which 
recommended repeal of the Act because of its limited scope. The continuance of this Act 
should be considered in light of the fact that the Supreme Court in Sarla Mudgal Vs. Union of 
India [AIR 1995 SC 1531] has said that allowing dissolution of marriage under the laws of the 
converted person is tantamount to destroying the existing rights of the other spouse who 
continues to belong to the same religion. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No.7 of its compendium of 100 laws to be repealed, 
inter alio, stated that the aforesaid Act has very limited scope since it is not applicable to the 
27 
personal laws of Christians, Mohammedans and Jews. In effect, it is only applicable to 
persons professing Hindu religion, who convert to Christianity. It further observed that the Act 
is redundant and the procedure created under this law is repetitive and unnecessary, as the 
Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 provides for divorce or a judicial separation on the ground of 
change of religion of spouse. 
The Legislative Department vide their D.O. No. 11(29)/2014-Leg.1 dated the 12th 
September, 2014 at SI. No. 42 of the Annexure annexed to the said D.O. letter have 
recommended for re-enactment and repeal of this Act in the light of changing socio-economic 
environment. 
Sections 4 and 5 of the Convert's Marriage Dissolution Act, 1866 reads as under:— 
[When convert deserted by his wife may sue for conjugal society. 
4. When convert deserted by his wife may sue for conjugal society.-If a husband change his religion for 
Christianity, and if in consequence of such change his wife, for the space of six continuous months, 
desert or repudiate him, he may sue her for conjugal society. 
When convert deserted by her husband may sue. 
5. When convert deserted by her husband may sue.-If a wife change her religion for Christianity, and if in 
consequence of such change her husband, for the space of six continuous months, desert or repudiate 
her, she may sue him for conjugal society.". 
Section 13 (1) (ii) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 reads as under:— 
[13. Divorce. (1) Any marriage solemnized, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, 
may, on a petition presented by either the husband or the wife, be dissolved by a decree of divorce on the 
ground that the other party- 
(i) has, after the solemnization of the marriage, had voluntary, sexual intercourse with any person 
other than his or her spouse ; or 
(ia) has, after the solemnization of the marriage, treated the petitioner with cruelty; or 
 
(ib) has deserted the petitioner for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately 
preceding the presentation of the petition; or 
(it) has ceased to be a Hindu by conversion to another religion; or 
(iii) has been incurably of unsound mind, or has been suffering continuously or intermittently from 
mental disorder of such a kind and to such an extent that the petitioner cannot reasonably be expected 
to live with the respondent.] 
The Committee feels that the provisions of the Convert's Marriage Dissolution 
Act, 1866 negates the grounds of divorce provided in section 13(1) (ii) of the Hindu 
Marriage Act, 1955, which was enacted after 88 years of the enactment of the Convert's 
Marriage Dissolution Act, 1866. 
In view of above, the Convert's Marriage Dissolution Act, 1866 can be repealed. 
14. The Ganges Tolls Act, 1867 (I of 1867) 
The aforesaid Act was passed by the Governor-General of India in Council and 
received the assent of the Governor-General on the 18th January, 1867. The aforesaid Act 
authorises the levy of tolls for the improvement of the navigation of the Ganges between 
Allahabad [Now in State of Uttar Pradesh] and Dinapore [now called Danapur situate in the 
State of Bihar] 
The aforesaid Act has been recommended for repeal by the PC Jain Commission at Sl. 
No. 34 in its Appendix A-1(166 Central Acts for repeal). 
The Law Commission in its 148th Report (1993) recommended repealing this Act on 
the ground that even though there may not be any direct contradictions or inconsistencies 
between the two Acts (1867 and 1982), but there is a possibility of some double taxation. It 
has been further stated that the language used in the aforesaid Act is archaic as it stipulates 
that a toll not exceeding 12 annas per hundred maunds shall be payable. While this is not in 
28 
itself sufficient ground for repeal, it makes the aforesaid Act yet another example of a law 
behind the times. There is no evidence of any recent use of aforesaid Act. 
The Law Commission of India again in its 248th Report at SI. No. 18 under Chapter 4 
of the Report had recommended for the repeal of the aforesaid Act (without mentioning the 
necessity of consultation with the relevant State). The Law Commission observed that the 
aforesaid Act was enacted to authorise the levy of tolls for the improvement of the navigation 
of the Ganges. The Act uses antiquated language, inconsonant with modern times. More 
importantly, the Act became redundant when the National Waterway (Allahabad-Haldia 
Stretch of the Ganga-Bhagirathi Hooghly River) Act, 1982 was enacted, which covers the 
scope of this Act. The 1982 Act provides for the regulation and development of the Ganga-
Bhagirathi-Hooghly River for purposes of shipping and navigation and authorises the levy of 
toll in the region as well. 
The Centre for Civil Society at 51. No.32 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that the National Waterway (Allahabad-Haldia Stretch of the 
Ganga-Bhagirathi IIooghly River) Act, 1982 was enacted, to authorise the levy of toll in the 
same region and for the same purpose. They cited 148th Report of the Law Commission and 
stated that there are no legal implications due to repeal of the aforesaid Act. 
Attention is invited to Entries 30 and 56 of List-I-Union List) of the Seventh Schedule 
to the Constitution of India, which reads as follows:— 
"30.Carriage of passengers and goods by railway, sea or air, or by national waterways in 
mechanically propelled vessels.". 
"56.Regulation and development of inter-State rivers and river valleys to the extent to which such 
regulation and development under the control of the Union is declared by Parliament by law to 
be expedient in the public interest.". 
By efflux of time, the aforesaid Act has become obsolete and redundant. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid can be repealed. 
15. The Oriental Gas Company Act, 1867 (XI of 1867) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to empower the Oriental Gas Company Limited, to 
extend their operations to certain places in British India, which has ceased to exist now. The 
aforesaid Act was passed by the Governor General of India in Council and received the assent 
of the Governor General on the 1st March, 1867. 
The 10th Law Commission in its 96th Report inter alia observed that Government may 
consider if this Act, and also the analogous Act of 1867, are needed at all. After verification 
of the factual position, further action may be taken. 
The P.C. Jain Commission at Sl. No. 29 of Appendix A-1 (166 Central Acts for 
repeal), recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act without mentioning for consultation with 
the State Government. 
The 20th Law Commission at SI. No.9 under Chapter 4 in its 248th Report 
recommended for repeal after consultation with the relevant State. The Law Commission 
observed that this Act was enacted to extend the operations of the Oriental Gas Company Act, 
1857 to certain provinces which lay beyond the town of Calcutta. The reason for repeal for the 
1857 Act applies to this Act as well. 
The P.C. Jain Commission at SI. No. 29 of Appendix A-1 (166 Central Acts for 
repeal), recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act without mentioning for consultation with 
the State Government. The Law Commission in its aforesaid recommendation recommended 
for repeal in consultation with the relevant State as the aforesaid Act was enacted to confer 
certain powers on the Oriental Gas Company (OGC), such as the power to lay down pipes in 
Calcutta for the purpose of manufacturing, supplying and distributing fuel gas. OGC was 
originally an English Company, which has now ceased to exist. It was taken over by the State 
29 
of West Bengal and merged with a larger public utility company. The original 1867 Act serves 
no purpose now. 
Whereas, there is unanimous opinion amongst the P C Jain Commission and the Law 
Commission and the Committee to repeal the Act, there appears to be difference on the issue 
of consultation with the relevant State. The P C Jain Commission did not recommend for 
consultation with relevant State for repealing the aforesaid Act and list the aforesaid Act in 
Appendix A-1, i.e., under the category of 166 Central Acts to be repealed. But, the Law 
Commission recommended repeal of the Act in consultation with the relevant State. 
The Committee feels that the subject of the Act to be repealed is relatable to entries 43, 
44 and 53 of List -I (Union List) of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, which reads as 
under:— 
[Entry 43. Incorporation, regulation and winding up of trading corporations, including banking, insurance 
and financial corporations, but not including co-operative societies. 
Entry 44. Incorporation, regulation and winding up of corporations, whether trading or not, with objects 
not confined to one State, but not including universities. 
Entry 53. Regulation and development of oilfields and mineral oil resources; petroleum and petroleum 
products; other liquids and substances declared by Parliament by law to be dangerously inflammable.] 
By efflux of time, this Act has become obsolete and redundant. The Committee 
feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
16. The Foreign Recruiting Act, 1874 (IV of 1874) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to control recruiting in British India for the service of 
Foreign States. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Governor General of India in Council 
and received the assent of the Governor General on the 24th February, 1874. 
P.C. Jain Commission also recommended for its repeal at Sl. No.85 of Appendix A-1 
(166 Central Acts for repeal). 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th Report has also recommended for its repeal 
at Sl. No.23 under Chapter 4 of its Report. The Law Commission observed that the aforesaid 
Act empowered the Government to issue an order that prevented the recruitment of Indians by 
a foreign State. The Act confers a wide discretion on the Government to specify the conditions 
under which persons may be barred from being recruited by a foreign State. According to the 
Law Commission, in its 43rd Report on Offences against National Security (1971), such wide 
discretion might potentially violate the constitutional guarantee to freedom of occupation 
under Article 19. The 2nd Administrative Reforms Commission Report of 2006 has also 
observed that this Act is outdated. This Act has been recommended for repeal by the PC Jain 
Commission in its Appendix A-1. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No.11 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that the aforesaid Act was enacted with the interests of the British 
Raj in mind, to prevent colonial subjects from serving any rival European power. Under this 
Act the central government is given unlimited power to prohibit recruiting to both military and 
non-military foreign service. It does not specify the conditions which must be satisfied before 
the government issues such an order, making the discretionary power extremely wide. The 
Law Commission in its 43rd Report (1971) has observed that such wide powers may run 
contrary to Constitutional guarantees under Article 19. The Second Administrative Reforms 
Commission Report of 2006 has also relied on the aforementioned report of the Law 
Commission to state that the Foreign Recruiting Act is out of date. Its provisions are not in 
sync with a modern globalised economy, and as a result it is not in use today.

No.4312/SS(AMS,AD&CPV)/2014 dated the 22nd September, 2014 at Si. No. 11 of 
Annexure appended thereto, stated that the aforesaid Act is a very old, pre-independence Act 
of 1874. The purpose of this Act is to control recruiting in India for service in foreign states. 
We have no objection for the repeal of this Act. The issue is referred to Ministry of Law and 
Justice for their views/concurrence. 
In view of the above, the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
17. The Indian Law Reports Act, 1875 (XVIII of 1875) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted for the improvements of Law Reports. The aforesaid 
Act was passed by the Governor General of India in Council and received the assent of the 
Governor General on the 13th October, 1875. 
The aforesaid Act, inter cilia, provides that no court shall bound to hear cited, or shall 
receive or treat as an authority binding on it, the report of any case decided by any of the said 
High Courts on or after the said day, other than a report published under the authority of the 
Governor General in Council. 
The P.C. Jain Commission also recommended for repeal of this Act at SI. No. 23 of 
Appendix A-1 (166 Central Acts recommended for repeal). 
The Law Commission in its Ninety-sixth Report inter alia observed as under: 
"Incidentally, it may be mentioned that the Law Reports Act does not apply to the decisions of 
the Privy Council, the Federal Court or the Supreme Court, though section 84, secondly 
paragraph, Evidence Act, applies to them (as it applies to other judicial decisions of superior 
courts). Because of these anomalies, also, the Act should be repealed.". 
The Centre for Civil Society at Si. No.91 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that the today different types of law reports are cited and accepted 
in all the Courts. In fact, the Indian Law Reporter (ILR) is seldom used as a source of 
authority. It further states that the aforesaid Act was enacted at a time when ILR was the 
primary reporter for publishing case laws. Today, the aforesaid Act is unnecessary since there 
are many good quality reporters like Supreme Court Cases, All India Reporters, Supreme 
Court Reporter, etc. Additionally, courts are also publishing their judgements and orders on 
their websites. The aforesaid Act is prone to be abused and adversely impact administration of 
justice. By virtue of this statute, a lower judge bench can ignore the judgement of a higher 
bench solely because it was not reported in the official report. This anomaly was pointed out 
by the Law Commission in its 96th Report (1984), which recommended repeal of the Act. It 
further stated that there are no legal issues that would impede repeal. 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at 51. No. 33 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act with suitable amendments without 
referring to the earlier recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission It has observed that the 
aforesaid Act mandates that no court of law in India shall hear the report of any case other 
than one cited in a law report published under the authority of the State Government. In effect, 
it provides that Courts are not bound to hear citations from any unauthorised series of law 
reports. The 96th LCI Report noted that it is well-known that notwithstanding the Act, 
unofficial law reports in India have been cited before the Supreme Court and the High Courts. 
Hence, the Act is a dead letter law and the Central Government should repeal this Act. 
In view of the above, and the provisions of the Evidence Act, 1872 (Sections 38 
and 84 and other provisions), the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act has become 
obsolete and redundant in today's context and the said Act can be repealed by making a 
special saving provision in the Repealing Bill, 2014 on the following lines, namely:— 
"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in section 4, the repeal 
of the Indian Law Reports Act, 1875, shall not, affect the citation or report of any case after 
repeal of this Act, which was admissible before the repeal of the aforesaid Act by this Act.". 
31 
18.The Central Provinces Laws Act, 1875 (XX of 1875) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to declare and amend the Laws in force in the Central 
Provinces. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Governor General of India in Council and 
received the assent of the Governor General on the 9th December, 1875. 
The P.C. Jain Commission also recommended for its repeal Sl. No.111 of Appendix A- 
1 (166 Central Acts recommended for repeal). 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th Report has also recommended for its repeal 
at Sl. No.25 under Chapter 4 of its Report. The Law Commission observed that the aforesaid 
Act deals with the extension of laws to the Central Provinces. Since the Central Provinces are 
no longer an administrative unit, this law may be repealed in the same manner as Item 21 
above. Repeal was also recommended by the PC Jain Commission in its Appendix A-1. 
By efflux of time this Act has become redundant and obsolete in the present day 
scenario. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
19. The Dramatic Performances Act, 1876 (XIX of 1876) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted for better control of public dramatic performances. 
The aforesaid Act was passed by the Governor General of India in Council and received the 
assent of the Governor General on the 16th December, 1876. 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th Report has classified the aforesaid Act 
under the category "Criminal Justice" and also recommended for its repeal at Sl. No.27 under 
Chapter 4 of the Report (without mentioning the necessity of consultation with the relevant 
State). The Law Commission observed that the aforesaid Act empowers the State Government 
to prohibit performances that are scandalous, defamatory or likely to excite feelings of 
disaffection. Disobeying such prohibitions attracts penalties. It was enacted during the 
colonial era and extensively used to curb nationalist sentiments propagated through dramatic 
performances. It has no place in a modern democratic society. States like Delhi and West 
Bengal have repealed it. In 2013, the Madras High Court in N. V Sankaran alias Gnani v. The 
State Of Tamil Nadu [2013 (1) CTC 686] held that Sections 2(1), 3, 4, 6 and 7 of the Tamil 
Nadu Dramatic Performance Act, 1954 and Rule 4 of the Tamil Nadu Dramatic Performances 
Rules, 1955 violate Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution. These provisions are substantially 
similar to the central legislation, which should be considered for repeal on these grounds. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No.98 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that the aforesaid Act that the aforesaid Act is a British era law 
enacted to curb the nationalist movement, and is no longer relevant in light of modern 
constitutional principles of freedom of speech and expression. Adequate provisions already 
exist under the Indian Penal Code to prosecute cases of sedition, defamation or obscenity 
under Section 124A and others. The Constitutional validity of the Act is in doubt since the 
Madras High Court in 2012 struck down the Kerala Dramatic Performances Act, which 
contained similar provisions. In 1993, the India Code Compilation of Un-repealed Central 
Acts included this Act in its list of obsolete Acts. The Act gives wide and coercive powers to 
the government related to prohibition of present and future performances, arbitrary search and 
seizure procedures, allowing any area to be controlled, etc., that are unsuited to modern India. 
It further stated that there are no legal issues that would impede repeal. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
32 
20.The Elephants Preservation Act, 1879 (VI of 1879) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted for the preservation of wild elephants. The 
aforesaid Act was passed by the Governor General of India in Council and received the assent 
of the Governor General on the 22nd March, 1879. 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th Report has also recommended for repeal of 
the aforesaid Act at 51. No.28 under Chapter 4 of the Report. The Law Commission, inter cilia, 
stated in the aforesaid Report that the purpose of the aforesaid Act is now subsumed by the 
Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, which has similar provisions on the prohibition of killing wild 
animals and procedures for licensing. Elephants are included within the ambit of the 1972 Act, 
which also has more stringent penalties. Therefore, the 1879 Act is redundant. 
The Centre for Civil Society at 51. No.15 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter cilia, stated that the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 deals with the same subject 
and has wider and more updated provisions dealing with the protection of wild animals, 
including elephants. Protection under the 1972 Act extends to elephants as well as various 
other mammals and therefore encompasses the purpose for which the 1879 Act was enacted. 
There is no documented example of any recent use of this Act. Neither is there any instance of 
a case in court under this law. When compared with the 1972 Act, the 1879 Act imposes a 
paltry fine of Rs 500 for violations. The 1972 Act imposes a relatively harsher penalty of a 
fine of Rs 25,000 or imprisonment for up to three years. Hence, the provisions of the 1972 Act 
are a greater deterrent for poachers and other potential offenders. In light of the 1972 Act, 
there is no need to have a separate Act for the protection of only elephants. While the older 
Act is redundant, it could be used as a legal loophole to escape the harsher penalties of the 
new law. For example, in cases involving caste atrocities, the accused have sometimes been 
charged solely under the older and less severe Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955, instead of 
the stricter SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. This is made possible where the 
same offence is punished under two laws, and one law imposes a lower penalty. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
21.The Hackney-carriage Act, 1879 (XIV of 1879) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted for the regulation and control of Hackney-
carriages in certain Municipalities and Cantonments. The aforesaid Act was passed by the 
Governor General of India in Council and received the assent of the Governor General on the 
5th September, 1879. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for its repeal at 51. No. 47 of 
Appendix A-5 (114 Acts recommended for repeal by State Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at SI. No. 37 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act in consultation with relevant State(s) 
referring to the earlier recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission 
has observed that the aforesaid Act provided for the regulation and control of hackney-
carriages in certain Municipalities and Cantonments. 'Hackney carriage', for the purposes of 
the Act meant any wheeled vehicle drawn by animals and used for the conveyance of 
passengers which is kept or offered or plies for hire. There is no evidence of recent use of this 
Act. Therefore, the Central Government should write to the concerned State Governments 
recommending the review of this law with a view to repeal. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No.14 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter cilia, observed that animal-drawn carriages are licensed by the police under 
local laws, rather than under Central laws such as this one and cited example, in Mumbai 
licensing of horse-drawn carriages is done under the Bombay Public Conveyance Act, 1920 
and this is a subject matter for local government, and in keeping with this principle, the 
government should repeal this Act. There is no record of the Act being in use in any of the 
33 
mentioned states since Independence. 
A perusal of the aforesaid Act reveals that the aforesaid Act applies to more than one 
area and to Cantonments, which have become part of more than one State. 
In view of above, the aforesaid Act has outlived its utility and became obsolete. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
22. The Raipur and Khatra Laws Act, 1879 (XIX of 1879) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to amend the laws in force in Thanas Raipur and 
Khattra. The aforesaid Act extends the enactments which arc in force in the Districts of 
Bankura to the Thanas Raipur and Khattra. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Governor 
General of India in Council and received the assent of the Governor General on the 29th 
October, 1879. 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th Report has classified the aforesaid Act 
under the category "State Reorganisation and extension of Laws" and also recommended for 
its repeal SI. No.30 under Chapter 4 of the Report (without mentioning the necessity of 
consultation with the relevant State). The Law Commission observed that this law was 
enacted when Raipur and Khattra were transferred to the District of Bankura, to enforce the 
same laws in these places as was in force in the rest of Bankura. It is conceptually similar to 
the Dehra Dun Act, 1871 and may be repealed for the same reasons. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act, which is still in force and exist on 
Statutes Book can be repealed as the same has become redundant and obsolete by efflux 
of time. 
23. The Municipal Taxation Act, 1881 (XI of 1881) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to give power to prohibit the levy of municipal 
taxes in certain cases such as persons in the military service or by the Secretary for India in 
Council. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Governor General of India in Council and 
received the assent of the Governor General on the 25th February, 1881. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has recommended for its repeal at SI. No. 69 of Appendix-
A-5 (114 Central Acts to be repealed by State Governments). 
The aforesaid Act, inter alia, provided to exemption from levy of local taxes payable 
by any person subject to the Army Discipline and Regulation Act, 1879, or the Indian Articles 
of War, who is compelled by the exigencies of military duty to reside within the limits of a 
municipality; or payable by the Secretary of State for India in Council. 
The object of the aforesaid Act has become redundant by efflux of time. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
24. The Fort William Act, 1881 (XIII of 1881) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to provide for better government of Fort Williams. The 
aforesaid Act was passed by the Governor General of India in Council and received the assent 
of the Governor General on the 11th March, 1881. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for its repeal at 51. No.43 of 
Appendix A-5 (114 Central Acts recommended for repeal by State Governments). 
The Law Commission in its one hundred and forty-eighth Report has opined that they 
cannot recommend its repeal. The Law Commission in its 148th Report (1993) held that the 
delegation to a Commissioned Officer in the Indian Army of the power to try and punish 
34 
persons charged with the violation of the rules framed under the Act is contrary to the general 
scheme of the Constitution and is opposed to the directive principle of separation of the 
judiciary from the executive. 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th Report has also recommended for its repeal 
at SI. No.31 under Chapter 4 of its Report and, inter alia, observed that the aforesaid Act 
provided for the better government of Fort William in Bengal and the Chief of Army Staff was 
given the power to make rules in relation to the matters specified in the Schedule appended to 
the Act (some of the matters being throwing dirt or rubbish, rash and negligent driving, 
disorderly behaviour in public). It further observed that the aforesaid Act imposes light 
penalties, as little as a fine for Rs. 50 or imprisonment for 4 days, for infringement of these 
rules. It also observed that the aforesaid Act was considered for repeal by the 148th Law 
Commission Report, 1993 for being unconstitutional and observed that "the delegation to a 
Commissioned Officer in the Indian Army of the power to try and punish persons charged 
with the violation of the rules framed under the Act is contrary to the general scheme of the 
Constitution and is opposed to the directive principle of separation of the judiciary from the 
executive.". 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No. 16 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that the Act can be repealed as the Army is now governed by the 
Army Act, 1950, and the Armed Forces Tribunal Act, 2007. It further stated that Fort William 
is the official Headquarter of the Eastern Command of the Indian Army and certain provisions 
of the Act are unconstitutional. It further stated that in addition, under Section 6 of the Act, a 
police officer can detain any arrested person for an unlimited period of time until the dctenue 
signs a bond of a specific amount. 
By efflux of time and in view of the position stated at paragraphs 3 to 9 above, the 
Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
25. The Bikrama Singh's Estates Act, 1883 (X of 1883) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to confirm and give effect to an award made by His 
Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General regarding certain matters in dispute between 
Sardar Bikrama Singh and the Kapurthala State. The aforesaid Act was passed by the 
Governor General of India in Council and received the assent of the Governor General on the 
18th July, 1883. Through the aforesaid Act, the lands situate in Sitapur and Raibareli Districts 
were vested in Sardar Bikrama Singh. The aforesaid said Act came into force at once i.e., on 
the 18th July, 1883. 
The P.C. Jain Commission also recommended for its repeal at SI No. 102 of Appendix-
A-5 (114 Central Acts to be repeal by the State Governments).. 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at SI. No. 41 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission observed that the 
aforesaid Act gave effect to an award made by the Viceroy and the Governor-General-in-
Council regarding certain matters in dispute between Raja Bikrama Singh and the Raja of 
Kapurthala State. By means of this settlement, he was instructed to leave Kapurthala and settle 
in Jalandhar. The Act also provided that if Bikrama Singh left behind a male heir, the proper 
law of inheritance would apply, otherwise the property would go to the Raja of Kapurthala. 
The purpose of this Act has been fulfilled. Any pending proceedings under the original Act 
will continue to be saved through a suitable savings clause. Consequently, this Act must be 
repealed. 
Now, by efflux of time, this Act became irrelevant and obsolete. The actions and other matter 
35 
would be saved under the general saving clause of the Repealing Bill, 2014 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed in view of general 
saving clause incorporated in section 4 of the draft Repealing Bill, 2014. 
26. The Land Acquisition (Mines) Act, 1885. (XVIII of 1885) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for cases in which Mines or Minerals 
are situate under land which it is desired to acquire under the Land Acquisition Act, 1870. The 
aforesaid Act was passed by the Governor General of India in Council and received the assent 
of the Governor General on the 16th October, 1885. 
Sub-section (1) of section 2 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 reads as follows:- 
"2.0) The Land Acquisition Act, 1870 and section 74 of the Punjab Courts Act, 1884 are hereby 
repealed.". 
Section 74 of the Punjab Courts Act, 1884 reads as under:- 
" 74. In the Land Acquisition Act, 1870, section 3, before the words "British Burma" in both places

The Land Acquisition Act, 1894 has been repealed and re-enacted as the Right to Fair 
Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 
2013 (30 of 2013). In view of the repeal of 1870 Act by 1894 Act and repeal of 1894 Act by 
Act No. 30 of 2013, the Land Acquisition (Mines) Act, 1885 became redundant and obsolete 
in its application. The Land Acquisition (Mines) Act, 1885 became inapplicable in view of 
the repeal of 1870 and 1894 Acts. 
Attention is also invited to entry 54 of the List- I (Union List) of the Seventh Schedule 
to the Constitution which reads as under:- 
"54. Regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which such regulation and 
development under the control of the Union is declared by Parliament by law to be expedient in the public 
interest .". 
In view of the above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
27. The Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act, 1886 (VI of 1886) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the voluntary registration of certain 
Births and Deaths, for the establishment of General Registry Offices for keeping Registers of 
certain Births, Deaths and Marriages, and for certain other purposes. The aforesaid Act was 
passed by the Governor General of India in Council and received the assent of the Governor 
General on the 8th March, 1886. 
The P.C. Jain Commission also recommended for its repeal at Sl. No. 23 of 
Appendix A-5 (114 Central Acts for repeal by State Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th Report has also recommended for its repeal 
at SI. No.33 under Chapter 4 of the Report, and has, inter alio, opined that the registration of 
births and deaths is already provided for under the Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 
1969, while marriages are registered under the Hindu Marriage Act, Special Marriage Act etc. 
and therefore the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
Attention is invited to Entry 5 and 45 of List III (Concurrent List) of the Seventh 
Schedule to the Constitution which inter alia confers legislative competence upon the 
Parliament in respect of aforesaid Act. 
Entries 5 and 45 of List III-Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution reads 
as under: - 
"5. Marriage and divorce; infants and minors; adoption; wills, intestacy and succession; joint family and 
partition; all matters in respect of which parties in judicial proceedings were immediately before the 
commencement of this Constitution subject to their personal law. 
45. Inquiries and statistics for the purposes of any of the matters specified in List II or List III.". 
The Registration of Births and Deaths (Amendment) Bill, 2013 was passed by Rajya Sabha 
36 
and was on consideration of the Lok Sabha and has lapsed on the dissolution of the 15th Lok Sabha. 
The Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act, 1886, has become redundant in 
view of the Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969. 
In view of the above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
28. The Indian Tramways Act, 1886 (XI of 1886) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to facilitate the construction and to regulate the 
working of Tramways. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Governor General of India in 
Council and received the assent of the Governor General on the 12th March, 1886. 
The P.C. Jain Commission also recommended for its repeal at S1.No.50 of Appendix 
A-5 (114 Central Acts for repeal by States). 
Sub-section (1) of section 2 of the aforesaid Acts extend in the first instance to the 
whole of India (used British India in the Act which was amended A.O. 1950), except the 
territories administered by the Governor of Fort Saint George in Council, the Governor of 
Bombay in Council and the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal. 
The legislative competence in respect of railways under Entry 22 of the List-I-Union 
List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution is vested with the Parliament. 
Clause (20) of article 366 reads as under:— 
"(20)"railway" does not include— 
(a) a tramway wholly within a municipal area, or 
(b) any other line of communication wholly situate in one State and declared by Parliament by law not 
to be a railway;". 
Attention is invited to Entry 57 of the List-II (State List) of the Seventh Schedule to 
the Constitution. The legislative power in respect of railways under is vested with the State 
Legislature which reads as under "Taxes on vehicles, whether mechanically propelled or not, 
suitable for use on roads, including tramcars subject to the provisions of entry 35 of List 
III.". The aforesaid Entry 35 of List III-Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule to the 
Constitution of India reads as under: 
"35. Mechanically propelled vehicles including the principles on which taxes on such vehicles are to 
be levied.". 
By efflux of time, the aforesaid Act has become redundant. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be 
repealed after making a specific savings on the following lines, namely:—
"Without prejudice to the provisions contained in section 4, the repeal of the 
Indian Tramways Act, 1886, by this Act, shall not affect its application to any territory 
specified in that Act before such repeal.". 
29. The Oudh Wasikas Act, 1886 (XXI of 1886) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to declare certain allowances collectively known 
as Oudh Wasikas to be pensions within the meaning of the Pensions Act, 1871. The aforesaid 
Act was passed by the Governor General of India in Council and received the assent of the 
Governor General on the 24th September,1886. 
The preamble, inter alia, states that the trust accruing on the loans made by the rulers 
of the Oudh to the East India Company with intent that the interest accruing thereon should be 
applied by the said Government to the payment of certain pensions (which pensions are 
known as Loan Wasikas). The Amanat Wasikas, the Zamanat Wasikas and the Loan Wasikas 
are pensions within the meaning of pension under the Pensions Act, 1871, which is still in 
force. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No.17 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that the aforesaid Act that the princely state of Oudh does not exist 
37 
and hence, the allowance payable to the royal family of Oudh has also ceased to exist. The 
aforesaid Act is completely obsolete now. 
The aforesaid Act has become redundant and obsolete and has no application in 
the present context and needs to be repealed. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
30. The Police Act, 1888 (III of 1888) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to amend the law relating to the regulation of 
Police. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Governor General of India in Council and 
received the assent of the Governor General on the 17th February, 1888. 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to relax the provisions of certain other Acts for the 
regulation of police which restrict the employment of police-officers to the presidency, 
province or place of the police establishment of which they are members. The aforesaid Act 
contains provisions to provide that a member of the police-establishment of any presidency, 
province or place may discharge the functions of a police-officer in any part of then British 
India (now India by A.O. 1950) beyond the limits of the presidency, province or place. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has recommended for its repeal at Sl.No.77 of Appendix 
A-5 (114 Central Acts to be repealed by State Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at Sl. No. 46 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission observed that the 
aforesaid Act was enacted to relax those provisions of certain State Police Acts for the 
regulation of police which restricted the employment of police-officers to the presidency, 
province or place of the police-establishment of which they are members. This Act • 
empowered the Central Government to create a special police district embracing parts of two 
or more States, and extend to every part of the said district the powers and jurisdiction of 
members of a police force belonging to the State specified in the notification. Police is now a 
State subject (See Entry 2, List II, Seventh Schedule) and hence, the Central Government 
cannot create special police districts and assign a police force to such districts. While Entry 80 
of List I does empower the Parliament to make a law extending the jurisdiction of the police 
of one State to exercise jurisdiction in another State, the same cannot be done without the 
consent of the State Government in which such area is situated. This Act does not impose any. 
such restrictions on the Central Government's power and hence, the constitutionality of this 
Act is suspect. This Act was recommended for repeal by the PC Jain Commission Report 
(Appendix A-5). There is no evidence of recent use of this Act. Hence, the Central 
Goverment should repeal this Act. 
The Committee feels that the in today's context and the scheme of legislation, the 
aforesaid Act has become obsolete and redundant and can be repealed. 
31. The Indian Tolls Act, 1888 ( VIII of 1888) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to remove doubts as to the legality of the levy of 
certain tolls. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Governor General of India in Council and 
received the assent of the Governor General on the 5th September, 1888. 
The aforesaid Act was enacted for the operation of that Act in any part then British 
India (now India by A.O. 1950) beyond the limits of the territories administered by the 
Governor of Fort Saint George in Council, and the Lieutenant Governors of Bengal and the 
North-Western Provinces and for validation of past levy of tolls. 
The aforesaid Act has become redundant and obsolete in view of changed 
38 
circumstances and needs to be repealed. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
32. The Excise (Malt Liquors) Act, 1890 (XIII of 1890) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to amend the Excise Act,1881, and the Bengal 
Excise Act, 1878 and to apply to Malt Liquor certain provisions of the Sea Customs Act, 1878 
respecting Spirit. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Governor General of India in Council 
and received the assent of the Governor General on the 28th March, 1890. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has recommended for its repeal SI. No. 57 of Appendix A-1 
(166 Central Acts recommended for repeal). 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at SI. No. 48 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act without referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission observed that the 
aforesaid Act applied the provisions of the Sea Customs Act, 1878 to malt liquors. The Sea 
Customs Act has been repealed by the Customs Act of 1962. Hence this Act should also be 
repealed. 
The aforesaid Act become redundant as the Excise Act, 1881 and the Sea Customs 
Act, 1878 have already been repealed by Act No. 12 of 1896 and Act No. 52 of 1962. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
33. The Marriages Validation Act, 1892. (II of 1892) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to validate certain marriages solemnized under 
Part VI of the Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872. The aforesaid Act was passed by the 
Governor General of India in Council and received the assent of the Governor General on the 
29th January, 1892. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has recommended for its repeal at 51. No. 159 of Appendix 
A-1 (166 Central Acts for repeal). 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at Si. No. 51 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act without referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission observed that the 
aforesaid Act was enacted to validate certain marriages solemnised under Part VI of the Indian 
Christian Marriage Act, 1872. The Act validated marriages between two persons of whom 
only one was an Indian Christian, and deemed them both to be Indian Christians. The purpose 
of this Act has now been fulfilled. A suitable savings clause must be added to the repealing 
Act so as to save the rights accrued under this Act. 
The Legislative Department vide their D.O. No. 11(29)/2014-Leg.I dated the 12th 
September, 2014 at SI. No. 45 of the Annexure annexed to the said D.O. letter have also 
recommended for the repeal of the aforesaid Act. 
In view of the above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed 
after making a specific saving clause on the following lines, namely:— 
"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in section 4, the repeal 
of the Marriages Validation Act, 1892 shall not affect the marriages validated by section 3 of 
the said Act and certificates validated by section 4 thereof, as they stood before such repeal.". 
34. The Government Management of Private Estates Act, 1892 (X of 1892) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the levy of a rate on private estates 
under the management of the Government to meet the cost of supervision and management. 
The aforesaid Act was passed by the Governor General of India in Council and received the 
39 
assent of the Governor General on the 25th October, 1892. 
The P.C. Jain Commission in its Report at SI. No. 46 of Appendix A-5 (114 Central 
Acts recommended to be repealed by the States) has recommended for the repeal of the 
aforesaid Act. 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at Sl. No. 53 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission observed that the Act 
imposed a levy of a certain rate on private estates under the management of the Government to 
meet the costs of supervision and management. 'Estates' for the purpose of this Act meant 
estates under the Court of Wards; encumbered estates under Government management and 
estates attached for default of payment. It included management of estates belonging to 
landholders in princely States. Since this system of landholding, as it existed prior to 
independence does not exist now, this Act is redundant. 
Sub-section (2) of section 1 of the aforesaid Act extends to the whole of then British 
India (now India by A.O. 1950) inclusive of upper Burma and British Baluchistan. After the 
commencement of the Constitution and provisions thereof, the aforesaid Act has become 
redundant in view of the Estates abolition Acts enacted by the State Legislature such as the 
Madras Estate (Abolition) Act, 1948 and the Orissa Estate (Abolition) Act, 1951. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
35. The Porahat Estate Act, 1893 (II of 1893) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to annexe the estate of Porahat to the Singhbhum 
District, and for certain other purposes. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Governor 
General of India in Council and received the assent of the Governor General on the 3rd 
February, 1893. 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at Sl. No. 54 under Chapter 2 of the • 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act in consultation with relevant 
State(s). The Law Commission observed that the aforesaid Act annexed the estate of Porahat 
to the Singhbhum district. This Act brought Porahat under the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant 
Governor of Bengal. Singhbhum is a district in the present-day State of Jharkhand and thus, 
subject to the authority and jurisdiction of the State Government. As its purpose has been 
fulfilled, the Act now needs to be repealed. 
Section 2 of the aforesaid Act provides that the estate of Porahat shall henceforth 
become and be part of the Singhbhum District. Further, section 3 of the aforesaid Act provides 
that the estate of Porahat, as forming part of the Singhbhum District shall form part of the 
Scheduled District described in Part III of the First Schedule to the Scheduled District Act, 
1874, as the Chota Nagpur Division. The Act served its purpose and became redundant by 
efflux of time and needs to be repealed. 
In view of the above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
36. The Government Grants Act, 1895. (XV of 1895) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to explain the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, so far as 
it relates to grants from the Crown, and to remove certain doubts as to the powers of the 
Crown in relation to such grants. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Governor General of 
India in Council and received the assent of the Governor General on the 10th October, 1895. 
The P.C. Jain Commission also recommended for its repeal at Sl. No. 45 of Appendix 
A-5 (114 Central Acts repealed for repeal by State Governments). 
Section 2 of the aforesaid Act provides that the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 shall 
not apply to any grant or other transfer of land or of any interest therein hereto fore made or 
40 
hereafter to be made by or on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen Empress, her heirs or 
successors, or by or on behalf of the Secretary of State for India in Council to, or in favour o1 
any person whomsoever. 
The aforesaid Act served its purpose and became redundant by efflux of time and 
needs to be repealed. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
37. The Public Servants (Inquiries) Act (1850) Amendment Act, 1897 
(I of 1897) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to amend Act XXXVIII of 1850 (for regulating 
Inquiries into the behaviour of Public Servants). The aforesaid Act was passed by the 
Governor General of India in Council and received the assent of the Governor General on the 
25th October, 1892. 
The aforesaid Act consists of only four sections out of which sections 2, 3 and 4 have 
been repealed by Act No. 1 of 1938. 
Section 1 of the aforesaid Act gives short title to the Public Servants (Inquiries) Act, 
1850, which has been recommended at Si. No. 5 above for repeal and therefore the aforesaid 
Act has served its purpose and has become redundant. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
38. The Repealing and Amending Act, 1897 (V of 1897) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to repeal certain obsolete enactments and to amend 
and facilitate the citation of certain other enactments. The aforesaid Act was passed by the 
Governor General of India in Council and received the assent of the Governor General on the 
25th February, 1897. 
The P.C. Jain Commission also recommended for repeal of the Amending Act, 1897 
(the correct title of the aforesaid Act is "the Repealing and Amending Act, 1897") at Sl. No. 
39 of Appendix A-1 (166 Central Acts for repeal). 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at Si. No. 55 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission observed that the 
aforesaid Act was passed to repeal and amend certain laws. It also provided for the use of 
short titles to facilitate the citation of certain laws listed in the Third Schedule to the Act. Most 
of the laws listed have since been repealed, and a suitable savings clause may be drafted to 
address the remaining laws. This law can therefore be repealed. 
Before 1850, the Acts were enacted by the name of the subjects of the Act. 
Subsequently, by the Third Schedule to the aforesaid Act, the short titles were given to such 
subjects of the Acts and Regulations mentioned in the aforesaid Third Schedule. The aforesaid 
Act has served its purpose and became redundant by efflux of time and needs to be repealed. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed after making a 
specific savings clause in the Repealing Bill, 2014 on the following lines saving short 
titles given to the subjects enacted as an Act and also to the Regulations from 1850 to 
1892, so as to not to effect citation of such Acts and Regulations, namely:— 
"Without prejudice to the generality of provisions contained in section 4, the repeal of 
the Amending Act, 1897, by this Act, shall not affect the short titles given to the Acts and 
Regulations mentioned under column 4 of the Third Schedule to the Amending Act, 1897 
before such repeal and the Acts and Regulations to which such short titles have been given, 
shall, after the repeal of the Repealing and Amending Act, 1897, continue to be cited with the 
aforesaid short titles as so given and as amended from time to time by subsequent Acts after 
41 
commencement of the Repealing and Amending Act, 1897.". 
39. The Reformatory Schools Act, 1897 (VIII of 1897) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to amend the law relating to Reformatory Schools 
and to make further provision for dealing with youthful offenders. The aforesaid Act was 
passed by the Governor General of India in Council and received the assent of the Governor 
General on the 11th March, 1897. 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th Report has also recommended for its repeal 
Sl. No.37 under Chapter 4 of the Report. The Law Commission observed that the aforesaid 
Act was enacted to amend the law relating to reformatory schools and to make further 
provisions for dealing with 'youthful offenders'. It gives the power to establish Reformatory 
Schools, inspect them, and for courts to direct youthful offenders to these schools. The Law 
Commission further stated that this Act may be in conflict with article 14 of the Constitution 
as it only applicable to boy under the age of 15, and not to girls. The Act speaks of 'detention' 
in reformatory schools which is against the scheme of the Juvenile Justice (Care and 
Protection of Children) Act, 2000, which governs the juvenile justice procedure for all , 
children below the age of 18, and provides for setting up of observation homes and special 
homes for juveniles in conflict with law. In light of this, the Reformatory Schools Act, 1897 is 
in conflict with newer law. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No.18 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that the Juvenile Justice Act, 1986, has been repealed by the 
Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000. It targets two groups—children . 
in need of care and protection, and juveniles in conflict with law. It provides for setting up of 
observation homes and special homes for juveniles in conflict with law and children homes for 
children needing care and protection during the pendency of inquiry and subsequent 
rehabilitation. These are under scrutiny of the Juvenile Justice Board. Section 63 of the 
Juvenile Justice Act, 1986, repealed any law in force in any State that corresponded to the Act, 
on the date on which the Act came into force in the concerned State. The Reformatory Schools 
Act, 1897 was one of the legislations, which was still in force at that time, but has not been 
formally repealed. It further observed that under the Constitution of India, the subject matter 
of any such legislation falls in the State List, but a Central law was enacted to fulfil India's 
international obligations. 
By efflux of time, the Act lost its relevance and needs to be repealed. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
40. The Indian Short Titles Act, 1897 (XIV of 1897) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to facilitate the citation of certain Acts and 
thereafter such Acts were titled with short titles. The aforesaid Act was passed by the 
Governor General of India in Council and received the assent of the Governor General on the 
22nd July, 1897. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has recommended for its repeal at Sl. No. 62 of Appendix 
A-1(166 Central Acts recommended for repeal). 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at Sl. No. 56 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act without referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission observed that similar to 
the Amending Act of 1897, this Act allowed the use of short titles to facilitate the citation of 
certain laws listed in the Schedule to the Act. The purpose of the Act has now been fulfilled 
42 
and hence, it must now be repealed. Most of the laws listed have since been repealed, and a 
suitable savings clause may be drafted to address the remaining laws. This law can therefore 
be repealed. 
Prior to Year 1850, the Central Acts were given long titles. Subsequently after 1850, 
the short-titles were by the aforesaid Act which contains only two sections and one Schedule 
by which the short titles was given to the Central Acts enacted before 1850. 
The Act served its purpose and became redundant by efflux of time and needs to be 
repealed. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed after making a 
specific clause in the Repealing Bill, 2014 on the following lines saving short-titles given 
to the Acts from 1834 to 1897 by the Schedule to the Indian Short Titles Act, 1897, so as 
to not to effect citation of such Acts, namely:— 
"Without prejudice to the generality of provisions contained in section 4, the repeal of 
the Indian Short Titles Act, 1897, by this Act, shall not affect the short titles given to the Acts 
mentioned under column 4 of the Schedule to the aforesaid Act before such repeal and the 
Acts to which such short titles have been so given by the aforesaid Act, shall, after the repeal 
of the Indian Short Titles Act, 1897, continue to be cited with the aforesaid short titles as so 
given and as amended from time to time by subsequent Acts, after such repeal.". 
41. The Lepers Act, 1898 (III of 1898) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for segregation and medical treatment 
of pauper lepers and the control of lepers following certain callings. The aforesaid Act was 
passed by the Governor General of India in Council and received the assent of the Governor 
General on the 4th February, 1898. 
The aforesaid Act, inter alia, contains provisions for appointment of Inspectors of 
Lepers and Superintendent of Asylum and arrest of pauper Lepers, prohibition of lepers from 
following certain trades and doing certain acts and make violations of such followings or 
doing an offence and re-arrest of escaped lepers. 
The P.C. Jain Commission also recommended for its repeal at SI. No. 56 of Appendix 
A-1 (166 Central Acts recommended for repeal). The P.C. Jain Commission indicated the title 
of the Act as the "Lepers Act, 1894". There is no such Act enacted in the year 1894. The 
Lepers Act was enacted in the year 1898 titled as 'the Lepers Act, 1898 (III of 1898) and 
therefore the same has been included in this Chapter by the Committee for examination. 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at Sl. No. 57 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act in consultation with relevant State(s) 
referring to the earlier recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission 
observed that the Act provided for the segregation and medical treatment of pauper lepers. 
The Act established 'leper asylums' and conditions for employment of personnel to these 
asylums. Law Commission further stated that section 1(3) of this Act mandates that it shall not 
come into force in any territory until the concerned State Government makes a declaration to 
that effect. The Act has already been repealed in the States of Gujarat, Assam, Nagaland, 
Meghalaya, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Punjab, Karnataka, Orissa, Himachal Pradesh, 
and Maharashtra, and in the Union Territories of Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, 
Lakshadweep, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Chandigarh. This law, which is completely out of 
sync with the modern understanding of the disease and its treatment, must be repealed. The 
Act is unconstitutional for being violative of Article 14 of the Constitution because it legalises 
forcible segregation of people affected with leprosy. India is a signatory to the United Nations 
Resolution on the Elimination of Discrimination against Persons Affected by Leprosy and 
their Family Members, 2011 (A/RES/65/215). This legislation goes against the spirit of this 
Resolution. Hence, the Central Government should inquire whether it is in force in any other 
43 
State, and repeal this law in consultation with any such State. 
The Department of Health and Family Welfare vide its I.D. Note No. H. 
11018/02/2014-parlt. dated 12th September, 2014 at serial No. 14 of Annexure-I to the 
aforesaid I.D. Note has stated that the need for its repeal or otherwise is being examined. 
They have indicated the title of the Act as the "Lepers Act, 1894". There is no such Act 
enacted in the year 1894. The Lepers Act was enacted in the year 1898 titled as 'the Lepers 
Act, 1898 (III of 1898). 
In view of that India is a signatory to the United Nations Resolution on the Elimination 
of Discrimination against Persons Affected by Leprosy and their Family Members, 2011 
(A/RES/65/215) and the aforesaid Act goes against the spirit of this Resolution and therefore 
the aforesaid can be repealed in pursuance of article 253 of the Constitution. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
42. The Church of Scotland Kirk Sessions Act, 1899 (XXII1 of 1899) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the incorporation of Kirk Sessions 
of the Church of Scotland in British India. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Governor 
General of India in Council and received the assent of the Governor General on the 27th 
September, 1899. 
The Legislative Department vide their D.O. No. 11(29)/2014-L.I dated 12th 
September, 2014 stated that the aforesaid Act is required to be repealed as it is irrelevant 
(outdated law). 
Section 2 of the aforesaid Act provides that every Kirk Session which has been, or may 
hereafter be, duly constituted to be a Church Court for ecclesiastical purposes in pursuance of 
an Act of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, is hereby declared to be, and the 
same shall be, a body corporate having perpetual succession and a common seal. It further 
provides that a Notification by the Governor General in Council in the Gazette of India that a 
Kirk Session has been duly constituted in pursuance of an Act of the General Assembly of the 
Church of Scotland shall be conclusive proof that it has been so constituted. By efflux of time, 
this Act has become redundant in its application and lost its relevance. 
The aforesaid implies that the Kirk Session which may be, duly constituted to be a 
Church Court by an Act of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland shall be, a body 
corporate having perpetual succession and a common seal. The legislatures under the 
Constitution of India are competent to make laws for incorporation of a body corporate in 
India. Declaration of Kirk Sessions by General Assembly of the Church of Scotland (other 
than competent Legislatures in India i.e. Parliament or State Legislatures) to be a body 
corporate, (having perpetual succession and a common seal) in India may not stand the legal 
scrutiny. The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act become obsolete after the 
commencement of the Constitution and become obsolete and outlived its utility. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
43. The Repealing and Amending Act, 1901 (XI of 1901) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to facilitate the citation of certain enactments and 
to amend and repeal certain obsolete enactments. The aforesaid Act was passed by the 
Governor General of India in Council and received the assent of the Governor General on the 
25th October, 1901. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for repeal of the Amending Act, 
1901 (11 of 1901) instead of the "Repealing and Amending Act, 1901 (XI of 1901) at SI. 
No.40 of Appendix A-1(166 Central Acts recommended for repeal), which is still in force. 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at SI. No. 60 under Chapter 2 of the 
44 
Report also recommended for repeal of the Amending Act, 1901 (11 of 1901) instead of the 
"Repealing and Amending Act, 1901 (XI of 1901) without referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission observed that Similar 
to the Amending Act of 1897, this Act allowed the use of short titles to facilitate the citation 
of certain laws listed in the Schedule to the Act. The purpose of the Act has now been fulfilled 
and hence, it must now be repealed. Most of the laws listed have since been repealed, and a 
suitable savings clause may be drafted to address the remaining laws. This law can therefore 
be repealed. 
As per legislative practice, the repealing and amending Acts are being repealed. By 
efflux of time, this Act has become redundant in its application and lost its relevance. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed after making a 
specific saving clause in the Repealing Bill, 2014 on the following lines saving the short 
titles given to— 
(a) the Madras Regulations from specified under Part I of the First Schedule to the 
aforesaid Act; 
(b) Acts of the Governor General in Council specified under Part II of the Schedule to 
the aforesaid Act; 
(c) Acts of the Governor of Fort Saint George in Council under Part III of the Schedule 
to the aforesaid Act, so as to not to effect citation of such Acts, namely:—
"Without prejudice to the generality of provisions contained in section 4, the repeal of 
the Repealing and Amending Act, 1901 (XI of 1901), by this Act, shall not affect the short 
titles given to- 
(i) the Madras Regulations from specified under Part I of the First Schedule; 
(ii) Acts of the Governor General in Council specified under Part II of the Schedule; and 
(iii) Acts of the Governor of Fort St. George in Council under Part III of the Schedule, 
by the Repealing and Amending Act, 1901, before such repeal, and the aforesaid Regulations 
and Acts to which such short titles had been so given, shall, after the repeal of the Repealing 
and Amending Act, 1901, by this Act, continue to be cited with the aforesaid short titles as so 
given and if amended, from time to time, by subsequent Acts, by such short titles as so 
amended after such repeal.". 
44. The Indian Tramways Act, 1902 (IV of 1902) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to apply the provisions of the Indian Railway 
Companies Act, 1895 to certain Tramway Companies. The aforesaid Act was passed by the 
Governor General of India in Council and received the assent of the Governor General on the 
14th February, 1902. 
The Indian Tramways Act, 1902 contains only two sections. Section 2 of the Indian 
Tramways Act, 1902 reads as under:— 
[2. Application of Act 10, 1895, to Tramway Companies. The Central Government may, by notification 
in the Official Gazette, direct that the provisions of the Indian Railway Companies Act, 1895 (10 of 
1895), in so far as the same are applicable, shall apply to any Company formed for the construction 
of a tramway under the Bengal Tramways Act, 1883 (Ben. 3 of 1883), or the Indian Tramways Act, 
1886 (11 of 1886), and thereupon it shall be lawful for the Tramway Company mentioned in the 
notification to pay interest upon its paid-up share capital out of capital in the manner and subject to 
the conditions prescribed by the said Indian Railway Companies Act, 1895.] 
The P.C. Jain Commission has recommended for its repeal at Sl. No.51 of Appendix 
A-5 (114 Central Acts recommended for repeal by the State Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at SI. No. 61 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act without referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission observed the aforesaid 
Act extended the application of the Indian Railway Companies Act, 1895 to certain tramway 
45 
companies. The 1895 Act has been repealed by the Railway Companies Act, 2001. The 1902 
law is now redundant. Therefore, it must be repealed. 
The Indian Railway Companies Act, 1895 (section 3 of this Act contains provision for 
payment of interest) was repealed by Act No. 24 of 2001. In view of the repeal of the 
aforesaid Act, the provisions of the Tramways Act, 1902 lost their relevance and has become 
obsolete and redundant. 
In view of the above, the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
45. The Repealing and Amending Act, 1903 (1 of 1903). 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to facilitate the citation of certain enactments and to 
amend and repeal certain obsolete enactments. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Governor 
General of India in Council and received the assent of the Governor General on the 6th March, 
1903. The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for repeal of the Amending Act, 
1903 (1 of 1903) instead of the "Repealing and Amending Act, 1903 (I of 1903) Sl. No.41 of 
Appendix A-1(166 Central Acts recommended for repeal). 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at SI. No. 62 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the for repeal of the Amending Act, 1903 (1 of 1903) 
instead of the "Repealing and Amending Act, 1903 (I of 1903) without referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission observed that similar 
to the Amending Act of 1897, this Act allowed the use of short titles to facilitate the citation 
of certain laws listed in the Schedule to the Act. The purpose of the Act has now been fulfilled 
and hence, it must now be repealed. Most of the laws listed have since been repealed, and a 
suitable savings clause may be drafted to address the remaining laws. This law can therefore 
be repealed. 
As per legislative practice, the Repealing and Amending Acts are being repealed. By 
efflux of time, this Act has become redundant in its application and lost its relevance. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed after making a 
specific clause in the Repealing Bill, 2014 on the following lines saving the short titles 
given to— 
(a) the Regulations of the Bengal Code from specified under Part I of the First Schedule 
to the aforesaid Act; 
(b) Acts of the Governor General in Council specified under Part 11 of the Schedule to the 
aforesaid Act; 
(c) Bengal Acts under Part III of the Schedule to the aforesaid Act, so as to not to effect 
citation of such Acts, namely:— 
"Without prejudice to the generality of provisions containcd in section 4, the repeal of the 
Repealing and Amending Act, 1903 (I of 1903), by this Act, shall not affect the short titles 
given to- 
(i) the Regulations of Bengal Code specified under Part I of the First Schedule; 
(ii) Acts of the Governor General in Council specified under Part II of the Schedule; and 
(iii) Bengal Acts specified under Part III of the Schedule, 
to the Repealing and Amending Act, 1903, before such repeal and the aforesaid Regulations 
and Acts to which such short titles have been so given, shall, after the repeal of the Repealing 
and Amending Act, 1903, by this Act, continue to be cited with the aforesaid short titles as so 
given and if amended from time to time by subsequent Acts, by such short titles after such 
repeal.". 
46 
46. The Bengal, Bihar and Orissa and Assam Laws Act, 1912 (VII of 1912) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to make certain provisions regarding the 
application of the laws in force in the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal, the Province of 
Bihar and Orissa and the Province of Assam. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Governor 
General of India in Council and received the assent of the Governor General on the 26th 
March, 1912. 
The P.C. Jain Commission also recommended for its repeal at SI. No. 6 of Appendix 
A-5 (114 Central Acts recommended for repeal by the State Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th Report has also recommended for its repeal 
at SI. No.40 under Chapter 4 of the Report (without mentioning the consultation with the 
relevant State) and stated that the aforesaid law was enacted as a result of administrative 
reorganisation of the Provinces of Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Assam. The construction of 
certain references in existing laws were altered as a result by this Act. The administrative 
needs of this Act have expired, and it may be repealed. 
The Law Commission of India again in its 249th Report has recommended for repeal 
of the aforesaid Act in consultation with the relevant States (s) at SI. No. 65 under Chapter 2 
of its Report. The Law Commission in its report observed as under:— 
"The Act provided for the applicability of laws in the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal, the 
Province of Bihar and Orissa and the Province of Assam, following the creation of the Province of Bihar and 
Orissa. It also empowered the Governor-General-in-Council to extend the application of certain Acts to these 
territories. The administrative units to which this law refers no longer exists, and therefore this law should be 
repealed.". 
The 248th Report was given by the Law Commission on 12th September, 2014. The 
249th Report was given by the Law Commission on 13th October, 2014. The Law 
Commission recommended in its 248th Report for the repeal of the aforesaid Act without 
mentioning the consultation with the relevant State, whereas, in the 249th Report, the 
Commission recommended repeal of the aforesaid Act in consultation with the relevant 
States. The observations of the Law Commission in both the reports appears to be different 
from one another. 
The aforesaid Act has become redundant in view of the re-organisation of the States. 
In view of the above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed 
under this Chapter. 
47. The Wild Birds and Animals Protection Act, 1912 (VIII of 1912) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to make better provision for the protection and 
preservation of certain wild birds and animals. 	
The aforesaid Act was passed by the 
Governor General of India in Council and received the assent of the Governor General on the 
18th September, 1912. 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th Report has also recommended for its repeal 
at SI. No.41 under Chapter 4 of the Report and observed that the aforesaid Act made it an 
offence to capture, kill or carry on trade of any bird or animal included in the Schedule 
annexed to the Act. The purpose of the Act is now subsumed by the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 
1972 which ensures the protection of wild animals, birds and plants with more stringent 
penalties. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No.19 of its compendium of 100 laws to be repealed 
inter alia stated that the aforesaid Act can be repealed since the objects and reasons of this 
legislation are being sufficiently met with by the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and the 
Rules framed there under. In fact, the Act of 1972 notes in its Statement of Objects and 
Reasons that the Act of 1912 has become completely outmoded. The Schedules to the 1972 
Act includes comprehensive lists of protected birds, animals and endangered plants reflecting 
the current requirements for their protection. The 1972 Act is wider in scope and provides for 
extended protection by declaring certain areas as national parks or 'sanctuaries' and for their 
management. It further observed that the 1912 Act imposes a paltry fine of Rs. 50 for 
47 
violations and the Act of 1972 imposes a relatively harsher penalty of a fine of Rs. 25,000 or 
imprisonment for up to three years. The older Act is redundant and could be used as a legal 
loophole to escape the harsher penalties of the new law. The Act of 1912 should therefore be 
repealed. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
48. Sir Currimbhoy Ebrahim Baronetcy (Amendment) Act, 1917 
(XXV of 1917) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to amend the Sir Currimbhoy Ebrahim Baronetcy 
Act, 1913. 	
The aforesaid Act was passed by the Indian Legislative Council and received 
the assent of the Governor General on the 27th September, 1917. Sir Currimbhoy Ebrahim 
Baronetcy Act, 1913 was already repealed by Bombay Act No. 9 of 1960. Sir Currimbhoy 
Ebrahim Baronetcy (Amendment) Act, 1917 does not survive as the aforesaid Act does not 
contain any substantive or validation provisions. 
As per the records made available to the Committee by the Legislative Department, the 
aforesaid Act appears as not to have been repealed. The Legislative Department may verify 
the factual position about the enforcement of the aforesaid Act. 
In view of the above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
49. The Cattle-trespass (Amendment) Act, 1921 (XVII of 1921) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted further to amend the Cattle-trespass Act, 1871. The 
aforesaid Act was passed by the Indian Legislative Council and received the assent of the 
Governor General on the 30th September, 1921. The Cattle-trespass (Amendment) Act, 1921 
consists of three section, out of which section 3 of the said Act has been repealed by Act 12 of 
1927. 
Sub-section (3) of section 1 of the Cattle-trespass(Amendment) Act, 1921 reads as under:— 
"(3) The rest of the Act shall come into force in any Province or part thereof on such date as the Local 
Government may, by notification in the local official Gazette, appoint.". 
The aforesaid is not a principal Act, but an amending Act to the principal Act, i.e., the 
Cattle-trespass Act, 1871. The Cattle-trespass (Amendment) Act, 1921 does not contain any , 
validating or substantive provisions. The Committee could not reach to the copies of. the. 
Gazette notifications issued by the Local Authorities issued under aforesaid sub-section (3) 
and therefore considered it proper to repeal the aforesaid Act after making a saving clause. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed after 
making a specific saving clause in the Bill on the following lines, namely:— 
"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in section 4, the repeal 
of the Cattle-trespass (Amendment) Act, 1921, by this Act, shall not affect the power of the 
Local Government to impose fine under section 12 of the Cattle-trespass Act, 1871, [as 
substituted by the Cattle-trespass (Amendment) Act, 1921] and such Local Government shall 
after repeal of the Cattle-trespass (Amendment) Act, 1921, by this Act, continue to exercise 
power conferred on it for application of the provisions of section 12 of the Cattle-trespass Act, 
1871, as substituted by the Cattle-trespass (Amendment) Act, 1921 after such repeal.". 
50. The Hindu Inheritance (Removal of Disabilities) Act, 1928 (XII of 1928) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to amend the Hindu Law relating to exclusion 
from inheritance of certain classes of heirs and remove certain doubts. The aforesaid Act was 
passed by the Indian Legislature and received the assent of the Governor General on the 20th 
September, 1928. 
48 
The Legislative Department vide their D.O. No. 11(29)/2014-L.Idated 12th September, 
2014 at Si. No. 48 of the Annexure appended thereto stated that aforesaid Act is required to be 
repealed in the light of changing socio-economic environment and existing personal laws. 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at SI. No. 6 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. The Law Commission, inter alia, 
observed that the Act provided that no person governed by Hindu law would be excluded from 
any right or share in joint family property by reason only of any disease, deformity, or 
physical or mental defect. However, the Act excluded a person who had been from birth a 
lunatic or an idiot. The purpose of the Act has now been subsumed by Section 28 of the Hindu 
Succession Act, 1956 which provides that no person shall be disqualified from succeeding to 
any property on the ground of any disease, defect or deformity. There are no instances of 
recent judgments rendered under this Act. The 1928 Act is now redundant. Hence, the Central 
Government should repeal this Act. A suitable savings clause needs to be inserted in the 
repealing Act. 
Attention is invited to section 2 of the Hindu Inheritance (Removal of Disabilities) 
Act, 1928 (which excludes lunatic or idiot from inherited in joint family property) which reads 
as under:— 
[2. Persons not to be excluded from inheritance or rights in joint family property.-Notwithstanding 
any rule of Hindu Law or custom to the contrary, no person governed by the Hindu Law, other than 
a person who is and has been from birth a lunatic or idiot, shall be excluded from any right or share in 
joint family property by reason only of any disease, deformity, or physical or mental defect.] 
Attention is invited to sections 2 and 4 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 which are relevant 
for the purpose of repeal of the Hindu Inheritance (Removal of Disabilities) Act, 1928 and 
read as under:- 
12. Application of Act 
(1) This Act applies- 
(a) to any person, who is a Hindu by religion in any of its forms or developments including a Virashaiva, a 
Lingayat or a follower of the Brahmo, Prarthana or Arya Samaj; 
(b) to any person who is Buddhist, Jaina or Sikh by religion; and 
(c) to any other person who is not a Muslim, Christian, Parsi or Jew by religion unless it is proved that any 
such person would not have been governed by the Hindu law or by any custom or usage as part of that law 
in respect of any of the matters dealt with herein if this Act had not been passed. 
Explanation The following persons are Hindus, Buddhists, Jainas or Sikhs by religion, as the case may 
be:- 
(a) any child, legitimate or illegitimate, both of whose parents are Hindus, Buddhists, Jainas or Sikhs by 
religion; 
(b) any child, legitimate or illegitimate, one of whose parents is a Hindu, Buddhist, Jaina or Sikh by 
religion and who is brought up as a member of the tribe, community, group or family to which such parent 
belongs or belonged; 
(c) any person who is a convert or re-convert to the Hindu, Buddhist Jaina or Sikh religion. 
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), nothing contained in this Act shall apply to the 
members of any Scheduled Tribe within the meaning of clause (25) of article 366 of the Constitution 
unless the Central Government, by notification in the Official Gazette, otherwise directs. 
(3) The expression "Hindu" in any portion of this Act shall be construed as if it included a person who, 
though not a Hindu by religion, is, nevertheless, a person to whom this Act applies by virtue of the 
provisions contained in this section. 
4. Overriding effect of Act 
(I) Save as otherwise expressly provided in this Act,- 
(a) any text, rule or interpretation of Hindu law or any custom or usage as part of that law in force 
immediately before the commencement of this Act shall cease to have effect with respect to any matter for 
which provision is made in this Act; 
(b) any other law in force immediately before the commencement of this Act shall cease to apply to 
Hindus insofar as it is inconsistent with any of the provisions contained in this Act. 
(2) For the removal of doubts it is hereby declared that nothing contained in this Act shall be the 
provisions of any law for the time being in force providing for the prevention of fragmentation of 
agricultural holdings or for the fixation of ceilings or for the devolution of tenancy rights in respect of 
such holdings]. 
49 
In view of above, it is observed that - 
(a) the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 inter alia applies to any person, who is a Hindu by 
religion in any of its forms or developments including a Virashaiva, a Lingayat or a 
follower of the Brahmo, Prarthana or Arya Samaj, whereas the Hindu Inheritance 
(Removal of Disabilities) Act, 1928 does not apply to any person governed by the 
Dayabagha School of Hindu Law. 
(b) Section 4 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 inter alia provides that any other law in 
force immediately before the commencement of this Act shall cease to apply to Hindus • 
in so far as it is inconsistent with any of the provisions contained in this Act. 
By the enactment of Hindu Succession Act, 1956, the Hindu Inheritance (Removal 
of Disabilities) Act, 1928 has become redundant and the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
51. The Transfer of Property (Amendment) Supplementary Act, 1929 
(XXI of 1929) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to supplement the Transfer of Property 
(Amendment) Act, 1929 (XX of 1929) to make certain consequential amendments in various 
Acts in furtherance of the Transfer of Property (Amendment) Act, 1929. The aforesaid Act 
was passed by the Indian Legislature and received the assent of the Governor General on the 
4th October, 1929.The provisions of the Transfer of Property (Amendment) Act, 1929 and the 
Transfer of Property (Amendment) Supplementary Act, 1929 have been incorporated in the 
respective Acts from the 1st day of April, 1930. 
The aforesaid Act amends the Specific Relief Act, 1877, the Code of Civil Procedure, 
1908, the Indian Registration Act, 1908, the Hindu Transfers and Bequests Act, 1914, the . 
Hindu Disposition of Property Act, 1916, the Hindu Transfers and Bequests (City of Madras) 
Act, 1921 and the Indian Succession Act, 1925. The aforesaid Act contains 15 sections and 
all of which came into force on the 1st day of April, 1930 as specified under sub-section (2) of 
section 1 of the Transfer of Property (Amendment) Supplementary Act, 1929, which does not 
contain any substantive or validating provisions except certain savings specified under section 
15 of that Act. Sections 2 to 14 of the Transfer of Property (Amendment) Supplementary Act, 
1929 have been repealed by Act No. 1 of 1938. The P.C. Jain Commission has recommended 
that all the validation Acts may be repealed after providing specific saving clauses, where ever 
required. 
The Legislative Department vide their D.O. No. 11(29)/2014-L.Idated 12th September, 2014 
at Sl.No. 41 of the Annexure appended thereto stated that the aforesaid Act is required to be 
repealed as it is of no relevance. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed after making specific 
saving clause for the provisions contained in section 15 of the Transfer of Property 
(Amendment) Supplementary Act, 1929 on the following lines, namely:— 
"Without prejudice to the generality of provisions contained in section 4, the repeal of 
the Transfer of Property (Amendment) Supplementary Act, 1929, by this Act, shall not be 
deemed to affect, - 
(a) the terms or incidents of any transfer or disposition of property made or effected 
before the first day of April, 1930; 
(b) the validity, invalidity, effect or consequences of anything already done or suffered 
before the aforesaid date; 	
• 
(c) any right, title, obligation or liability already acquired; accrued or incurred before , 
such date; 
(d) any remedy or proceeding in respect of such right, title, obligation or liability; or 
(e) anything done in the course of any proceeding pending in any Court on the aforesaid 
date; and any such remedy or proceeding may be enforced, instituted or continued, as 
50 
the case may be, as if the Transfer of Property (Amendment) Supplementary Act, 1929 
had not been passed; 
(f) suit instituted or filed before the commencement of the Transfer of Property 
(Amendment) Supplementary Act, 1929 and pending on the 1st day of April, 1930, 
being the date on which the aforesaid Act came into force, either in a Court of first 
instance or of appeal filed.". 
52. The Sheriff of Calcutta (Powers of Custody) Act, 1931(20 of 1931) 
The aforesaid has been enacted for extending the power of the Sheriff of Calcutta to 
hold person in lawful custody in respect of certain cases. The aforesaid Act was passed by the 
Indian Legislative Council and received the assent of the Governor General on the 1st 
October, 1931. 
The provisions of the aforesaid Act were made to meet the exigencies felt during the 
British Rule in the Fort William and its surrounding areas for smooth implementation of the 
rule. 
Attention is invited to section 2 (1) of the aforesaid Act which reads as under:- 
"2(1)Where the Sheriff of the High Court of Judicature at Fort William in Bengal in the discharge of his 
duties is taking any person in his lawful custody to or from the Presidency Jail, and circumstances are 
such that he is unable without undue inconvenience to proceeds by a route lying wholly within the local 
limits of ordinary original civil jurisdiction of the said High Court, it shall be lawful for the Sheriff to 
proceed by any convenient route lying partly outside the said local limits, and in so doing his custody of 
such person shall continue to be lawful.". 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act is relatable to the legislative power of the 
Parliament conferred upon it under entry 2 of List-III-Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule 
to the Constitution which reads as under:- 
"2.Criminal procedure, including all matters included in the Code of Criminal Procedure at the 
commencement of this Constitution.". 
The P.C. Jain Commission also recommended for its repeal at Sl. No. 90 of Appendix 
A-5 (114 Central Acts for repeal by State Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th Report at SI. No. 45 under Chapter 4 of the 
Report has classified the aforesaid Act under the category "Criminal Justice" and 
• recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act (without mentioning the consultation with the 
relevant State). It has been observed that the aforesaid Act extended the powers of the 
Sheriffs of Calcutta to hold persons in lawful custody. If the Sheriff was required to take a 
route while holding a person that lay outside his jurisdiction, this Act permitted him to do so. 
The position now held by Sheriffs in Kolkata is purely titular, without any executive power, 
thuS making this Act unnecessary. There is no recorded evidence of the use of this Act. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No.21 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that since, the Sheriffs in Kolkata now hold an apolitical titular 
position, the powers granted under this Act are no longer relevant. There is no documented 
use of this Act. 
The aforesaid Act has, in view of the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
1973, became obsolete and redundant. 
In view of the above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
53.The Public Suits Validation Act, 1932 (11 of 1932) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to validate suits relating to any public matter 
which did not have sanction of the then Local Government and jurisdiction of the court to hear 
the suit, if filed within a limited period. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Indian 
Legislative Council and received the assent of the Governor General on the 8th April, 1932. 
51 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act is relatable to the legislative power of the 
Parliament conferred upon it under Entry 13 of List-III-Concurrent List of the Seventh 
Schedule to the Constitution which reads as under:- 
"13.Civil procedure, including, including all matters included in the Code of Civil Procedure at the 
commencement of this Constitution, limitation and arbitration.". 
The P.C. Jain Commission also recommended for its repeal at SI. No. 82 of Appendix 
A-5 (114 Central Acts for repeal by State Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th  Report at serial number 46 under Chapter 4 
of the Report, has also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act (without mentioning the 
consultation with the relevant State). The Law Commission in the aforesaid recommendation 
stated that this Act was enacted to validate certain suits relating to public matters instituted 
under Sections 91 and 92 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which were pending in 1932, and 
where the previous sanction of the State Government had not been obtained. The Law 
Commission further stated that these suits dealt with public nuisance and public trusts. Given 
that more than eighty years have passed since the suits governed by this Act was filed, this Act 
may be repealed with a suitable savings clause that ensures pending proceedings, if any, are 
unaffected by the repeal. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No.84 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alio, stated that the aforesaid Act is applicable to suits pending at the time of 
institution of the Act, i.e., in 1932. Since 82 years have passed since the aforesaid Act came 
into force, any litigation ought to have been disposed-off by now. It further states that the 
problem can be resolved by enacting a saving clause, alongside repeal, protecting all action 
taken under the Act. There is reference to the aforesaid Act in First Schedule of the Berar • 
Laws Act, 1941. With the saving clause, there are no legal issues that would impede repeal. 
The Legislative Department vide their D.O. No. 11(29)/2014-Leg.1 dated the 12th 
September, 2014 at SI. No. 14 of the Annexure annexed to the said D.O. letter have 
recommended for the repeal of the aforesaid Act. 
Attention is invited to Entry 13 of List III (Concurrent List) of the Seventh Schedule 
to the Constitution which reads as under:— 
"13. Civil procedure, including all matters included in the Code of Civil Procedure at the commencement 
of this Constitution, limitation and arbitration.". 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed after 
making a specific savings for validation of certain pending public suits on the following 
lines, namely :- 
"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in section 4, the repeal 
of the Public Suits Validation Act, 1932, by this Act, shall not affect the validation of the suits 
under section 2 of the aforesaid Act, as it stood before such repeal and any appeal pending 
under the aforesaid Act before such repeal shall be disposed of in accordance of the provisions 
of the aforesaid Act as it stood before such repeal.". 
54. The Bengal Suppression of Terrorist Outrages (Supplementary) Act, 
1932 (24 of 1932) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to supplement the Bengal Suppression of Terrorist 
Outrages Act, 1932. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Indian Legislative Council and 
received the assent of the Governor General on the 23rd December, 1932. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has recommended for its repeal at Si. No. 19 of Appendix A-5 
(114 Central Acts for repeal by State Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th  Report at serial number 47 under Chapter 4 of 
52 
its Report, has classified the aforesaid Act under the category "Criminal Justice" and also 
recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act (without mentioning the consultation with the 
relevant State). The Law Commission in the aforesaid recommendation stated that the 
Supplementary Act has no relevance since the chief Act has been repealed. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No.22 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alio, stated that the law was enacted to suppress the Indian freedom movement. 
The last reported cases under the Act date back to the 1930s and the law is no longer in use. 
Clearly, there is no need for such an Act now. The chief Act that this law supplemented, 
namely the Bengal Suppression of Terrorist Outrages Act, 1932, has been repealed. 
In view of above, the committee feels that the aforesaid Act had served its utility and 
now became redundant and therefore it can be repealed. 
55.The Children (Pledging of Labour) Act, 1933 (2 of 1933) 
The aforesaid Act was passed by the Indian Legislature in the year 1933 and received 
the assent of the Governor General on 24th February, 1933. 
The Law Commission in its 248th Report stated that the provisions of the aforesaid 
Act are not in synchronization with the provisions of the Child Labour (Prohibition and 
Regulation) Act, 1986 and recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act at serial No. 48 under 
Chapter 4 in its Report. 
The Law Commission of India again in its 250th  Report at SI. No. 7 under Chapter 2 of 
the Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. The Law Commission, inter 
alia, observed that the Act prohibited the making of agreements to pledge the labour of 
children, and the employment of children whose labour had been pledged. However, the 
purpose of this Act is defeated by the proviso to the definition of 'agreement' under Section 2. 
While an agreement to pledge the labour of a child is prohibited, the said proviso says that 'an 
agreement made without detriment to a child, and not made in consideration of any benefit 
other than reasonable wages to be paid for the child's service' is not prohibited. This proviso 
would have the effect of approving child labour upon the payment of reasonable wages. For 
this reason, the Report of the Second Indian National Labour Commission, 2002 also 
recommended repeal of this Act. Also, the fines imposed under the Act are paltry and would 
hardly serve as a deterrent. Hence, the Central Government should repeal this Act. 
Simultaneously, amendments should be made to the Child Labour (Prohibition and 
Regulation) Act, 1986 to penalise agreements pledging the labour of children. The Ministry of 
Labour and Employment is also contemplating repeal of this Act. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No.59 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated the Committee on Child Labour set up in 1979, headed by M S 
Gurupadaswamy found child labour legislations existing at the time to be inconsistent and 
recommended that a comprehensive legislation on prohibition and regulation of child labour 
be enacted instead. Following this, the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986 
was brought into force, outlining where and how children could work and where they could 
not. This renders the 1933 law obsolete. The Act, while declaring any such agreement to be 
void (Section 3), excludes those which were made without detriment to the child, or where 
reasonable wages were paid for the child's services and where the services of the child were 
terminable within a week's notice. In doing so, the law does not define what activity would be 
detrimental to the child and what would be considered to be a reasonable wage. The Report of 
the National Commission on Labour (2002) observes that this exception vitiates the purpose 
of the law and provides an easy way to wiggle out of the provisions of the Act. Based on a 
thorough analysis of the discrepancies in the Act, the Commission recommended the repeal of 
the Act, as it was inconsistent with the Convention on the Rights of Child. 
The object of the aforesaid Act as mentioned in long title is "to prohibit the pledging of 
53 
labour of children". 
The proviso to the definition of "an agreement to pledge the labour of child" in section 
2 of the aforesaid Act reads as under:-- 
"Provided that an agreement made without detriment to a child, and not made in consideration of any 
benefit other than reasonable wages to be paid for the child's services, and terminable at not more than a 
week's notice, is not an agreement within the meaning of the definition;". 
The said proviso negates the object of the aforesaid Act, but still it is existing on the 
statute book. In this connection, it is pertinent to mention that sub-para (iii) of paragraph of 
6.131 of volume II of the Report on the National Commission on Labour submitted in 2002 
(See Sl. No's 3 and 4 of Part-I of Volume IV) which reads as under:— 
"(iii) we are shocked at the proviso to the definition of 'an agreement of pledge of the labour of child' in 
Children (Pledging of Labour) Act, 1933. This proviso would amount to approving child labour if 
reasonable wages are paid. We think that, given this proviso, the entire purpose of the law is vitiated. 
Pledging of child labour can be made a crime under the criminal law of the land, and would, therefore, 
recommend the repeal of this law.". 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
56.The Assam Criminal Law Amendment (Supplementary)Act, 1934 
(27 of 1934) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to supplement the Assam Criminal Law 
Amendment Act, 1934 (Assam Act 3 of 1934) to bar on certain legal proceedings under Code 
of Criminal Procedure, 1898. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Indian Legislature and 
received the assent of the Governor General on 25th August, 1934. 
The Law Commission in its 248th  report at serial number 49 under Chapter 4 of its 
Report, has recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act (without mentioning the consultation 
with the relevant State). The Law Commission in the aforesaid recommendation stated that 
the chief Act and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 find mention in this Act and neither 
of these legislations exist anymore. The Law Commission further stated that the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1973 has replaced the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898, hence, the. 
 
Supplementary Act is redundant. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No.23 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alio, stated that the aforesaid Act makes references to the Assam Criminal Law 
Amendment Act, 1934 and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. Both these Acts are nom 
existent now. The Assam Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1934 does not find mention in the 
Chronological List of Central Acts published by the Ministry of Law and Justice, while the 
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, has been repealed by the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
1973. In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
57.The Jubbulpore and Chhattisgarh Divisions (Divorce Proceedings 
Validation) Act, 1935 (13 of 1935) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to remove certain doubts and to validate certain 
proceeding of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad during the period from 31.08.1923 to 
30.09.1935. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Indian Legislature and received the assent of 
the Governor General on the 30th September, 1935. 
The P.C. Jain Commission recommended for its repeal at 51. No. 157 of Appendix A-1 
(166 Central Acts recommended for repeal). 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at Sl. No. 8 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission, inter alio, observed 
54 
that the Act removed certain doubts and validated certain proceedings of the High Court of 
Judicature of Allahabad. The Act declared that from 31st August 1923, the Court of the 
Judicial Commissioner of the Central Provinces alone would have the jurisdiction of the Iligh 
Court under the Indian Divorce Act, 1869 within the Jubbalpore and Chhattisgarh divisions of 
the Central Provinces. The Act also validated certain decisions taken by the High Court of 
Allahabad and deemed such decisions to be as good and valid in law as if such proceedings 
had been taken by the Court of the Financial Commissioner. The Central Provinces, as they 
existed prior to Independence, do not exist now. Jabalpur is now a district in the State of 
Madhya Pradesh. Chhattisgarh was an administrative division in erstwhile Central Provinces. 
The territory falling under this division in now a part of the modern-day State of Chhattisgarh. 
The purpose of the Act has therefore now been fulfilled. A suitable savings clause should be 
inserted in the repealing Act. The Central Government should repeal this law after 
consultation with the relevant State governments. 
The aforesaid Act contains only three sections. Section 2 of the aforesaid Act relates to 
declaration as to jurisdiction of court of Judicial Commissioner of the Central Provinces. 
Section 3 of the aforesaid Act contains provisions relating to validation of proceedings of the 
High Court of judicature at Allahabad. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed with the following 
saving clause, namely:— 
"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in section 4, all the 
proceeding taken and all jurisdiction exercised by the High Court of judicature at Allahabad, 
during the period from 31.08.1923 to 30.09.1935 as a High Court under the Indian Divorce 
Act, (IV of 1869) within the Jubbulpore and Chhattisgarh Divisions of the Central Provinces 
shall, notwithstanding the repeal of the Jubbulpore and Chhattisgarh Divisions (Divorce 
Proceedings Validation) Act, 1935, by this Act, be deemed and always deemed to be as good 
and valid in law as if such proceedings had been taken and jurisdiction exercised by the Court 
of Judicial Commissioner of the Central Province and repeal of aforesaid Act by this Act shall 
not invalidate the proceeding taken and the jurisdiction exercised before such repeal.". 
58. The Decrees and Orders Validating Act, 1936 (5 of 1936) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to remove certain doubts and to establish the 
validity of certain proceedings of the High Courts of Judicature in British India (changed to 
India by A.O. 1950) under the Letters Patent erecting and establishing those Courts. The 
aforesaid Act was passed by the Indian Legislature and received the assent of the Governor 
General on 26th April, 1936. 
The P.C. Jain Commission recommended for its repeal at SI. No. 151 of Appendix A-1 
(166 Central Acts recommended for repeal). 
The Legislative Department vide their D.O. No. 11(29)/2014-Leg.I dated the 12th 
September, 2014 at SI. No. 15 of the Annexure annexed to the said D.O. letter have 
recommended for the repeal of the aforesaid Act. 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at Si. No. 9 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the earlier recommendations 
of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission, inter alia, observed that the Act removed 
certain doubts as to the validity of certain proceedings in the High Courts of Judicature at 
Bengal, Madras and Bombay. The Act clarified that no decree passed or order made by any of 
these High Courts in the exercise of their ordinary original civil jurisdiction under Clause 12 
of its Letters Patent, or by the IEgh Court of Judicature at Rangoon under Clause 10 of its 
Letters Patent, shall be called in question on the ground that the High Court passing that 
decree or making the order had no jurisdiction to do so. The purpose of this Act has been 
served and the Central Government should now repeal this Act. A suitable savings clause 
55 
should be inserted in the repealing Act. 
Section 2 of the aforesaid Act provides that certain decrees and orders not to be called 
in question. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed after making a 
special saving clause in the Repealing Bill, 2014 on the following lines, namely :-
"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in section 4, any 
decrees passed or orders made by High Courts in India or any proceedings concluded 
before them in exercise of their original civil jurisdiction under the Decrees and Orders 
Validating Act, 1936, notwithstanding the repeal of the Decrees and Orders Validating Act, 
1936, shall, after such repeal, not to be called in question and repeal of the Decrees and 
Orders Validating Act, 1936, by this Act, shall not invalidate, such decrees passed or orders 
made or any proceeding taken before such repeal.". 
59. The Bangalore Marriages Validating Act, 1936 (16 of 1936) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to validate certain marriages solemnized in the Civil 
and Military Station in Bangalore by Mr. Walter James Mc. Donald Redwood, a Missionary 
of Plymouth Brethern. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Indian Legislature and received 
the assent of the Governor General on 27th October, 1936. 
The P.C. Jain Commission recommended for its repeal at Sl. No. 147 of Appendix A-1 
(166 Central Acts recommended for repeal). 
The Law Commission of India in its 24811  report at Sl. No. 50 under Chapter 4 of the 
Report, has also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act (without mentioning the ,. 
necessity of consultation with the State Government). The Law Commission in the aforesaid 
recommendation stated that the Act has now served its purpose and hence, should be 
repealed. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Si. No.24 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that Mr. Walter James Mc. Donald Redwood solemnised certain 
marriages in Bangalore mistakenly believing that he was duly authorised to do the same. The 
aforesaid Act was enacted to validate these marriages. It further stated that the Act has now 
served its purpose and hence, should be repealed. 
The Legislative Department vide their D.O. No. 11(29)/2014-L.Idated 12th September, 
2014 at Si. No. 49 of the Annexure appended thereto stated that the aforesaid Act is required, 
 
to be repealed in the light of changing socio-economic environment and existing personal - 
laws. In view of the above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
60. The Red Cross Society (Allocation of Property) Act, 1936 (18 of 1936) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide out of the property of the Indian Red 
Cross Society a Fund to be administered in Burma by a Burma Red Cross Society, and to 
terminate in Burma the existing functions of the Indian Red Cross Society. The aforesaid Act 
was passed by the Indian Legislature and received the assent of the Governor General on 27th 
October, 1936. 
The territorial operation of the Red Cross Society was divided into two independent 
countries i.e., India and Myanmar and therefore the aforesaid Act was enacted to give effect to 
such division. The provisions of the aforesaid Act have served their purpose and has become 
redundant by efflux of time. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
56 
61.The Indian Companies (Amendment) Act, 1936 (22 of 1936) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to further amend the Indian Companies Act, 1913 (7 of 
1913). The aforesaid Act was passed by the Indian Legislature and received the assent of the 
Governor General on 27th October, 1936. 
As per sub-section (2) of section 1 of the aforesaid Act, the provisions of the aforesaid 
Act came into force from the date which may be appointed by the Governor General in 
Council by notification in the Gazette of India. As per records made available to the 
Committee by the Legislative Department, no reference was found as to whether the 
provisions of this Act have come into force or not. 
The Committee, notwithstanding any records for bringing into force the 
provisions of this Act, feels that the Act can be repealed as the Companies (Amendment) 
Act, 1936 was for amending the Companies Act, 1913 which had been repealed by the 
Companies Act, 1956. The Companies Act, 1956 has also been repealed by the 
Companies Act, 2013. Therefore, the Indian Companies (Amendment) Act, 1936 has 
become redundant 
62. The Hindu Women's Rights to Property (Amendment) Act, 1938 
(11 of 1938) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to amend the Hindu Women's Rights to Property 
Act, 1937. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Indian Legislature and received the assent of 
the Governor General on 8th April, 1938. 
The aforesaid Act has come into force from 14th day of April, 1937 as provided under 
sub-section (2) of section 1 of that Act. The aforesaid Act exists on Statute Book as per the 
records made available to the Committee by the Legislative Department. The aforesaid Act 
amended the Hindu Women's Rights to Property Act, 1937 which has been repealed by the 
Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (30 of 1956). There is no validation clause in the Hindu 
Women's Rights to Property (Amendment) Act, 1938 . In view of section 6A of the General 
Clauses Act, 1897, nothing survives in the Hindu Women's Rights to Property (Amendment) 
Act, 1938 being an Amending Act.. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
63. The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1938 (20 of 1938) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to supplement the criminal law by providing for the 
punishment of certain acts prejudicial to the recruitment of persons to serve in, and to the 
discipline of armed forces of the Union of India. 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th Report at SI. No. 10 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. The Law Commission, inter alia, 
observed that the Act provided for punishment of certain acts prejudicial to the recruitment of 
persons to serve in the Armed Forces of the Union. This Act was enacted to punish persons 
who made public speeches to dissuade persons from enlisting in the Defence Forces and from 
taking part in any war in which the British Empire would be engaged. The punishment 
prescribed for such an act was imprisonment for a term extending to 1 year, or fine, or both. 
This Act was meant to serve the needs of the British Empire and is now redundant. There is no 
evidence of recent use of this Act. Hence, the Central Government should repeal this Act. 
The Objects of the aforesaid Act as reflected in the Statement of objects and Reasons 
are as under:- 
"A large number of public speeches designed to dissuade persons from enlisting in the Defence 
Forces or, in the alternative, to incite would be recruits to commit acts of mutiny or insubordination after 
57 
joining those Forces have come to notice during the past 18 months. The object of the speakers is clearly 
not the spread of pacifism, but to dissuade would be recruits from taking part in any war in which the 
British Empire may become engaged. The Bill is designed to penalise these activities.". 
The main object of this Act was to prevent dissuasion from enlistment in armed forces 
and instigation to mutiny or insubordination after enlistment in the Armed Forces just before 
the Second World War. 
After lapse of more than sixty seven years of the commencement of the Constitution, 
the aforesaid Act has become redundant and obsolete. 
In view of above, the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
64. The Workmen's Compensation (Amendment) Act, 1939 (13 of 1939)

th  
March, 1939. 
The aforesaid Act contains 3 sections. Sub-section (2) of section 1 and section 2 has 
been repealed by the Repealing and Amending Act, 1942 (25 of 1942). Only sub-section (1) 
of section 1 and section 3 are existing. Section 3 of the aforesaid Act, inter alia, contains 
provisions for restoration of certain proceedings for the purposes mentioned in that section, 
(which was otherwise concluded as void for not coming under the ambit of the Act) if an 
application was made within six months from the date of coming into force of the Workmen's 
Compensation (Amendment) Act, 1939. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act has served its purpose and the 
remaining provisions have become redundant. Therefore, the Committee feels that the 
aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
65. The Indian Tariff (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1939 (29 of 1939) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted further to amend to amend the Indian Tariff Act, 
1934 and to validate the levy and collection of certain Duties under the aforesaid Act from 1st  
to 20th  April, 1939. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Indian Legislature and received the 
assent of the Governor General on 26th  September, 1939. 
The aforesaid contains only three sections. Section 1 relates to short title, section 2 
amended the Indian Tariff Act, 1934. Section 3, inter alia, contains validation provision for 
collection of levy and certain duties on the import of goods during the period commencing 
from 1st day, and ending 20th day of April, 1939. 
Section 2 of the Act was repealed by the Repealing and Amending Act, 1942 (25 of 
1942). Only sections 1 and 3 exist. The Indian Tariff Act, 1934 was repealed by the Customs 
Tariff Act, 1975 (51 of 1975). Sub-section (2) of section 12 of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 
contains saving provisions. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that nothing survives in the Indian Tariff 
(Fourth Amendment) Act, 1939 and can be repealed. 
66. The Income-tax Law Amendment Act, 1940 (12 of 1940) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to amend the law relating to Income-tax. The aforesaid 
Act was passed by the Indian Legislature and received the assent of the Governor General on 
26th  March, 1940. 
The aforesaid Act contains 10 sections. Subsequently, all the sections, except sections 
58 
1 and 9, were repealed by the Repealing and Amending Act, 1945 (6 of 1945). Section 9 
contains provisions for validity of certain assessments and proceedings made under the 
Income-tax Act, 1922 (11 of 1922). The Income-tax Act, 1922(11 of 1922) was repealed by 
section 297 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (43 of 1961), which contains saving provisions in 
respect of the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1922. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that nothing survives in the Income-tax 
Law Amendment Act, 1940 and can be repealed. 
67. The Berar Laws Act, 1941 (4 of 1941) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to extend the application of certain Central Laws 
to the province of Berar. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Indian Legislature and received 
the assent of the Governor General on 17th March, 1941. 
The Law Commission in its 148th  Report recommended the repeal of the aforesaid Act. 
The Law Commission again in its 248th  Report at SI. No. 51 under Chapter 4 of the Report, 
inter alia, has classified the aforesaid Act under the Category "State Reorganisation and 
Extension of Laws", observed that the aforesaid Act was enacted to extend the application of 
certain Central Laws to the erstwhile province of Berar and further observed that the object of 
the aforesaid Act was to assimilate the provisions of the Central Acts passed before April 1st, 
1937 with those which were passed after that date. Berar now ceases to exist as an 
independent administrative unit, and forms part of the State of Maharashtra and recommended 
the repeal of the aforesaid Act. The recommendations are silent about the consultation with 
the relevant State. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed as 
the erstwhile Berar State ceases to exist as an independent administrative unit. 
68.The Indian Merchant Shipping (Amendment) Act, 1941(22 of 1941) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted further to amend the Indian Merchant Shipping 
Act, 1923 (21 of 1923). The aforesaid Act was passed by the Indian Legislature and received 
the assent of the Governor General on 26th November, 1941. 
The Indian Merchant Shipping Act, 1923 (21 of 1923) was repealed by Part I of 
Schedule to the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 (44 of 1958). Section 461 of the Merchant 
Shipping Act, 1958 contains saving provision also. 
As per record made available to the Committee, no reference has been found as to 
whether this amendment Act has been repealed. Since the principal Act i.e., the Merchant 
Shipping Act, 1923 has already been repealed, nothing survives in the amendment Act i.e., the 
Indian Merchant Shipping (Amendment) Act, 1941. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
69. The Indian Income-tax (Amendment) Act, 1941 (23 of 1941) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted further to amend the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 
(11 of 1922). The aforesaid Act was passed by the Indian Legislature and received the assent 
of the Governor General on 26th November, 1941.

contains saving provision in respect of the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1922. Since the 
principal Act i.e., the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 had already been repealed by the Income-
tax Act, 1961 (43 of 1961), nothing survives in the Indian Income-tax (Amendment) Act, 
59 
1941. In view of above, the Committee feels that the Income-tax (Amendment) Act, 
1941 can be repealed. 
70. The Excess Profit Tax (Amendment) Act, 1941 (24 of 1941) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted further to amend the Excess Profit Tax Act, 1940 
(15 of 1940). The aforesaid Act was passed by the Indian Legislature and received the assent

The Excess Profit Tax Act, 1940 (15 of 1940) has been repealed by the Direct-Tax 
Laws (Miscellaneous) Repeal Act, 2000 and nothing survives in the Excess Profit Tax 
(Amendment) Act, 1941. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
71. The Railways (Local Authorities' Taxation) Act, 1941 (25 of 1941) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to regulate the extent to which railway property 
shall be liable to taxation imposed by an authority within a province. The aforesaid Act was 
passed by the Indian Legislature and received the assent of the Governor General on 26th  
November, 1941. 
The Law Commission in its 248th  Report at Sl. No. 52 under Chapter 4 of the Report 
has observed that section 184 of the Railways Act, 1989 provides for 'Taxation on Railways 
by Local Authorities' and the purpose of the 1941 Act has been saved by the 1989 Act. The 
Law Commission further recommended that after an assessment of both the Acts and by 
inserting a suitable savings provision, the Railways (Local Authorities' Taxation) Act, 
1941can be considered for repeal. 
Section 184 of the Railway Act, 1989 contains provisions for taxation on Railways by, 
local authorities and the aforesaid section 184 reads as under:— 
"Taxation on railways by local authorities.- 
184. (1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other law, a railway administration 
shall not be liable to pay any tax in aid of the funds of any local authority unless the Central • 
Government, by notification, declares the railway administration to be liable to pay the tax specified in 
such notification. 
(2) While a notification of the Central Government under sub-section (1) is in force, the railWay 
administration shall be liable to pay to the local authority either the tax specified in the notification or, 
in lieu thereof; such sum, if any, as an officer appointed in this behalf by the Central Government may, 
having regard to all the circumstances of the case, from time to time, determine to be fair and reasonable. 
(3) The Central Government may at any time revoke or vary a notification issued under sub-
section (1). 
(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent any railway administration from entering 
into a contract with any local authority for the supply of water or light, or for the scavenging of railway 
premises, or for any other service which the local authority may be rendering or be prepared to render to 
the railway administration. 
The Ministry of Railways (Railway Board) also vide their O.M. No. 2014/0&M/18/6 
dated the 22nd October, 2014 at Si. No. 8 of the Annexure appended thereto has 
recommended for repeal. The Ministry of Railways in their aforesaid O.M. stated as under:- 
"The Law Commission in its Report has recommended that 'The Act was enacted to declare the extent to 
which railway property shall be liable to taxation imposed by an authority within a State. However, 
Section 184 of the Railways Act, 1989 provides for 'Taxation on Railways by Local Authorities'. Hence, 
the purpose of the 1941 Act has been saved by the 1989 Act. After an assessment of both the Acts and by 
inserting a suitable savings provision, the 1941 Act can be considered for repeal.' Accordingly, the Act 
will be considered for repeal by following due procedure. ". 
60 
In view of the aforesaid provisions, the Railways (Local Authorities' Taxation) Act, 
1941 has become redundant and obsolete. 
The Committee feels that the Railways (Local Authorities' Taxation) Act, 1941 
can be repealed after making a specific saving clause on the following lines, namely:— 
"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in section 4, the repeal 
of the Railways (Local Authorities' Taxation) Act, 1941 shall not affect the liability of the 
Railway Administration to pay any tax in aid of the funds of any local authority as required 
under sub-section (1) of section 3 or to pay tax or in lieu thereof such sum as required under 
sub-section (2) of the aforesaid section or the power of the Central Government to revoke or 
vary any liability of the Railway Administration to pay tax under section 4 as they stood 
before such repeal.". 
72. The War Injuries (Compensation Insurance) Act, 1943 (23 of 1943) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to impose on employers a liability to pay 
compensation to workmen sustaining war injuries and to provide for the insurance of 
employers against such liability. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Indian Legislature and 
received the assent of the Governor General on 2'd  September, 1943. 
The Law Commission in its 248th  Report at SI. No.53 under Chapter 4 of the Report 
has recommended for repeal of this Act and stated that there is no evidence of this Act being 
used in the last five decades. The Law Commission further stated that the provisions of 
aforesaid Act may be validly covered under the Personal Injuries Compensation Insurance Act 
1963. 
Attention is invited to sections 4, 5 and 21 of the aforesaid Act which read as under:— 
[4. Limitation on right to receive compensation otherwise than under this Act and Ordinance 7 of 
1941. Where any person has a right apart from the provisions of this Act and of the War Injuries

respect of which compensation is payable under this Act, the right shall extend only to so much of such 
compensation or damages as exceeds the amount of compensation payable under this Act. 
5. Amount of compensation. (1) The compensation payable under this Act shall be as follows, namely:-

(ii) in the case of a minor-two hundred rupees; 
(b) where permanent total disablement results from the injury--

(ii) in the case of an injury not specified in the First Schedule--the percentage of such 
compensation specified in the First Schedule for a disablement held by a competent 
medical authority acting under the Scheme made under the War Injuries Ordinance, 1941 
(7 of 1941), to be of corresponding degree; 
61

(2) Where the monthly wages of a workman are more than three hundred rupees, the compensation 
payable under this Act shall be the amount payable under the provisions of sub-section (1) in the case of a 
workman whose monthly wages are more than two hundred rupees. 
21. Applications of the Scheme to certain parts of India. (1) If the central Government is satisfied that by 
the law of any part of India to which this Act does not extend or of the Administered Areas provision 
has been made substantially corresponding to the provision made by this Act imposing liabilities 
upon employers and requiring them to take out policies of insurance covering such liabilities, the 
Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, declare that this section shall 
apply to the territory of such part of India or comprising the Administered Areas. 
(2) On the application of this section to any such territory the Scheme made under this Act shall 
extend to the undertaking by the Central Government in respect of employers in that territory of the 
same liabilities in the same manner, to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as if such 
employers were in the territories to which this Act extends. 
(3) On the application of this section to any such territory the provisions of section 10 shall be 
deemed to prohibit any person except a person authorized by the Central Government as its agent to 
issue policies in pursuance of the Scheme from carrying on after the date of the notification by which 
this section is applied the business of insuring employers in that territory against liabilities insurance 
against which is provided under the Scheme.]. 
Having regard to the long title of the aforesaid Act, limitations on right to receive 
compensation other than under aforesaid Act and Ordinance No. VII of 1941 (War-time 
Permanent Ordinance), amount of compensation payable under section 5 and section 21 
contains provisions for application of the Scheme for Indian States and other provisions of the 
aforesaid Act, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act is obsolete and redundant. 
The Ministry of Labour in their e-mail dated 12th September, 2014 has not included 
the aforesaid Act in the list of the Acts administered by them. 
In the light of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
73.The Income-tax and Business Profit Tax (Amendment) Act, 1947 
(44 of 1947) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted further to amend the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 
and the Business Profits Tax Act, 1947. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Dominion 
Legislature. 
Both the aforesaid Acts i.e., the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 and the Business Profits 
Tax Act, 1947 have been repealed by Income-tax Act, 1961 (43 of 1961) and by the Direct 
Tax Laws (Miscellaneous) Repeal Act, 2000 (20 of 2000) respectively. As per records made 
available to the Committee by the Legislative Department, no reference was found as to 
whether the aforesaid Act has been repealed or not. 
Since the principal Acts i.e., the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 and the Business Profits 
62 
Tax Act, 1947 have already been repealed, nothing survives in the Income-tax and Business 
Profit Tax (Amendment) Act, 1947. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
74. The Indian Trade Unions (Amendment) Act, 1947 (45 of 1947) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted further to amend the Trade Unions Act, 1926 (16 
of 1926). The aforesaid Act was passed by the Dominion Legislature. 
The aforesaid Act was enacted further to amend the Trade Unions Act, 1926 (16 of 
1926). Sub-section (2) of section 1 provides that the aforesaid Act shall come into force on 
such date as the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette appoint. As 
per records made available to the Committee by the Legislative Department, no reference is 
available as to whether the provisions of the aforesaid Act have come into force or not. The 
Ministry of Labour in its e-mail dated 12th September, 2014 sent to the Office of the 
Committee is silent on the enforcement of the aforesaid Act. The aforesaid Act inter cilia 
contains provisions for the recognition of trade unions and unfair trade practices by trade 
unions. 
In view of Report of the First National Commission on Labour in 1969, and the Report 
of the Second National Commission on Labour in 2002 and expiry of 67 years of the 
enactment of the Indian Trade Unions (Amendment) Act, 1947, the Committee feels that the 
aforesaid Act, notwithstanding whether the provisions of the same has come into force or not, 
have become obsolete and redundant in today's context. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
75.The Indian Finance Act, 1948 ( 20 of 1948) 
The aforesaid Act was passed by the Dominion Legislature. 
The Committee feels that sections 4 and 6 amending the Indian Tariffs Act, 1934, 
section 7 amending the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944, (as it stood before amendment to its 
short title), section 8 amending the Income-tax Act, 1922 and section 10 amending the 
Business Profits Tax Act, 1947 (other than of being substantive provisions or provisions 
being governed by the Finance Act) can be repealed. 
76.The Junagarh Administration (Property) Act, 1948 (26 of 1948) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the vesting of certain property 
belonging to the State of Junagarh in the Administrator appointed by the Central Government. 
The aforesaid Act was passed by the Dominion Legislature and received the assent of the 
Governor General on the 13th April, 1948. 
The P.C. Jain Commission recommended for its repeal at SI. No. 52 of Appendix A-5 
(114 Central Acts recommended for repeal by the State Governments). 
The Law Commission in its 248th report at SI.No.54 under Chapter 4 of the Report, has 
recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act (without mentioning the necessity of 
consultation with the State Governments). The Law Commission in the aforesaid Report has 
stated that Junagarh was an erstwhile princely State in British India. Junagadh is now a district 
in Gujarat and is not covered under the Junagarh Administration (Property) Act, 1948. The 
Junagarh Administration (Property) Act, 1948 is now obsolete and has no application. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the provisions of the aforesaid Act 
have become redundant as this was an Act in furtherance of the accession of princely 
States into Union of India. The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
63 
77.The Continuance of Legal Proceedings Act, 1948 (38 of 1948) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the continuance of certain legal 
proceedings by or against the Secretary of State in respect of any right of India or any part of 
India which were pending immediately before the 15th  day of August, 1947. 
The Law Commission in its Ninety-sixth Report had recommended that having regard 
to the fact that the aforesaid Act was passed only to deal with the situation that arose 
immediately on partition, the aforesaid Act may now be repealed subject to examination of the 
question if it is really needed at the present day. Again, the Law Commission in its 248th  
Report at Sl. No. 55 under Chapter 4 of the Report (without mentioning the necessity of 
consultation with the State Government) has also recommended for repeal of this Act. 
The provisions of the aforesaid Act were transitory in nature and have now 
become irrelevant and the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
78.The Indian Matrimonial Causes (War Marriages) Act, 1948 (40 of 1948) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to confer upon Courts temporary jurisdiction in 
certain matrimonial causes. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Dominion Legislature and 
received the assent of the Governor General on the 3rd  September, 1948. 
The P.C. Jain Commission in paragraph 16.4.6 of its Report has stated that, "there are 
a number of personal laws (mentioned in Appendix-D to its report) applicable to some 
religions and communities. Some of these may not be relevant now and are also indeed very 
old. The perception of the concerned religion or community would be relevant for their 
updating/codification/repeal. The Commission recommends that further action be taken 
accordingly". 
The Legislative Department vide their D.O. No. 11(29)/2014-L.I dated 12th 
September, 2014 at SI.No.51 of the Annexure appended thereto stated that aforesaid Act is 
required to be repealed in the light of changing socio-economic environment and existing 
personal laws. 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at Sl. No. 14 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the recommendations of 
the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission, inter cella, observed that the aforesaid Act 
conferred upon courts temporary jurisdiction in certain matrimonial cases. It applies to, 
marriages solemnized during the 'war period' where the husband was, at the time of the 
marriage, domiciled outside India and the wife was immediately before the marriage, 
domiciled in India. 'War period' was defined under the Act as the period commencing on 3rd 
September 1939 and ending on 31st March 1946. The Act conferred jurisdiction on the High 
Court to entertain proceedings for divorce or for nullity of marriage. The purpose of the Act 
has been served and it can be repealed. A suitable savings clause should be inserted in the 
repealing Act. 
By the aforesaid Act, the temporary jurisdiction was conferred upon courts in 
matrimonial causes to those marriages which were solemnized between 03/09/1939 to 
31/03/1946, where the husband was at the time of marriage was domiciled outside India and 
wife was, immediately before marriage, domiciled in India. The provisions of the aforesaid 
Act were temporary and transitional in nature and have become redundant. 
In view of the above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
79.The Income-tax and Business Profit Tax (Amendment) Act, 1948 
(48 of 1948) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted further to amend the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 and 
64 
the Business Profits Tax Act, 1947. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Dominion 
Legislature and received the assent of the Governor General on the 8th September, 1948. 
The Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 and the Business Profits Tax Act, 1947 have been 
repealed by Income-tax Act, 1961 (43 of 1961) and by the Direct-Tax Laws (Miscellaneous) 
Repeal Act, 2000 (20 of 2000) respectively. 
Since the principal Acts i.e., the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 and the Business Profits 
Tax Act, 1947 have already been repealed and nothing survives in the Income-tax and 
Business Profit Tax (Amendment) Act, 1948. 
In view of the above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
80.The Imperial Library (Change of Name) Act, 1948 (51 of 1948) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted further to change the name of Imperial Library to 
National Library. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Dominion Legislature and received the 
assent of the Governor General on the 8th September, 1948. 
The aforesaid Act contains only two sections. Section 2 makes provision for change of 
Imperial Library to be known as National Library. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No.28 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that the purpose of the Act has been achieved. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act has served its purpose and became 
obsolete and can be repealed after making a saving clause on the following lines, 
namely:— 
"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in section 4, the 
change of name of Imperial Library to National Library by section 2 of the Imperial Library 
(Change of Name) Act, 1948, as it stood before such repeal, shall not affect, after such repeal, 
such change of name from 'Imperial Library' to 'National Library' in any law for the time 
being in force, or in any indenture, instrument or other document before or after such repeal.". 
81. The Indian Finance Act, 1949 (14 of 1949)

the Indian Tariff Act, 1934, section 7 amending the First Schedule to the Central Excise and 
Salt Act,1944 and section 8 amending the Income-tax Act, 1922 (other than of being

payable in respect of requisitioned land. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Dominion

The aforesaid Act provides for the apportionment of compensation payable in respect 
of requisitioned land by an arbitrator appointed under section 19 of the Defence of India Act, 
1939 (35 of 1939) or under section 6 of the Requisitioned Land (Continuance of Powers) Act, 
1947 (17 of 1947). Both these Acts (1939 and 1947) referred aforesaid have been repealed. the 
Defence of India Act, 1939 has been repealed by Act 2 of 1948 and of the Requisitioned Land 
(Continuance of Powers) Act, 1947 has been repealed by Act No. 30 of 1952. By virtue of the 
repeal of the Defence of India Act, 1939 (35 of 1939) and the Requisitioned Land 
65 
(Continuance of Powers) Act, 1947 (17 of 1947), the Requisitioned Land (Apportionment of 
Compensation) Act, 1949 has become redundant in its application. 
In view of the above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
83.The Indian Merchant Shipping (Amendment) Act, 1949 (53 of 1949) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted further to amend the Indian Merchant Shipping 
Act, 1923 (21 of 1923). The aforesaid Act was passed by the Dominion Legislature and 
received the assent of the Governor General on the 13th  December, 1949. 
The Indian Merchant Shipping Act, 1923 (21 of 1923) was repealed by Part I of 
Schedule to the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 (44 of 1958). Section 461 of the Merchant 
Shipping Act, 1958 contains saving provisions also. As per records made available to the 
Committee by the Legislative Department, no reference was found as to whether this 
amendment Act has been repealed or not. 
In view of the above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
84. The Professions Tax Limitation (Amendment and Validation) Act, 1949 
(61 of 1949) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted further to amend the Professional Tax Limitation 
Act, 1941 (20 of 1941) and to validate the imposition in the United Provinces of certain taxes 
on circumstances and property. 
The Law Commission in its Ninety-sixth Report (March, 1984) had recommended for 
retention of the aforesaid Act. 
The P.C. Jain Commission recommended for its repeal at Sl. No. 163 of Appendix A-1 
(166 Central Acts recommended for repeal by the Central Government). 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at Sl. No. 20 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission, inter alia, observed 
that the aforesaid Act amended the Professions Tax Limitation Act, 1941 and validated the 
imposition in the United Provinces of certain taxes on circumstances and property. The Act 
amended the Schedule appended to the Professions Tax Limitation Act, 1941. The Act also 
provided that taxes imposed under Section 128(1)(ix) of the United Provinces Municipalities 
Act, 1916 or Section 108(b) of the United Provinces District Boards Act, 1922 would not be 
invalid merely on the ground that the tax imposed exceeded the limit of Rs. 50 per annum. 
Both the United Provinces Acts have fallen into disuse and taxes are not imposed under these 
Acts. Also, the Professions Tax Limitation Act, 1941 was repealed by the Amending Order, 
1950. Hence, this Act is now redundant and the Central Government should repeal this Act. 
The Committee feels that since the principal Act i.e., Professional Tax Limitation Act, 
1941 has been repealed by A.O. 1950, nothing survives in the Professions Tax Limitation 
(Amendment and Validation) Act, 1949. 
In view of the above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
85.The Preventive Detention Act, 1950 (4 of 1950) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide preventive detention in certain cases 
and matters connected therewith. Sub-section (3) of section 1 of the aforesaid Act provided 
that it shall cease to have effect on the 1st day of April, 1951, save as respects things done or 
omitted to be done before that date. The aforesaid Act was amended from time to time. The 
Act was in operation upto the 31st day of December, 1969 as extended by the Preventive 
66 
Detention (Continuance) Act, 1966 (48 of 1966) (inadvertently mentioned as 48 of 1969 in the 
Central Acts of the year 1966) and thereafter it has ceased to operate. The Preventive 
Detention (Continuance) Act, 1966 (48 of 1966) has been repealed by the Repealing and 
Amending Act, 1974 (56 of 1974).Though the operation of the aforesaid Act has ceased to 
operate, yet it continues to exist on the Statute Book . 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed and the 
provisions of section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 would suffice to save the actions 
or,  proceedings of cases under the Preventive Detention Act, 1950. 
86. The Indian Tea Control (Amendment) Act, 1950 (9 of 1950) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted further to amend the Indian Tea Control Act, 1938 (8 of 
1938). As per the provisions of sub-section (2) of section 1 of the aforesaid Act, the Act came 
into force on the Is` April, 1950 and as per records made available to the Committee by the 
Legislative Department, no reference was found as to whether the aforesaid Act has been 
repealed. 
Since the principal Act i.e., the Indian Tea Control Act, 1938 (8 of 1938) has already 
been repealed by section 51 of the Tea Act, 1953 (29 of 1953), nothing survives in the Indian 
Tea Control (Amendment) Act, 1950, which does not contain any saving, validation or 
transitional provisions. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
87. The Finance Act, 1950 (25 of 1950) 
The Committee feels that section 3 amending the Income-tax Act, 1922, sections 4, 6 
and 7 amending the Indian Tariff Act, 1934 and section 8 amending the Central Excise and 
Salt Act,1944 [the short title of this Act as it stood before its amendment] (other than of 
being substantive provisions or provisions being governed by the Finance Act) of the 
aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
88.The Drugs (Control) Act, 1950 (26 of 1950) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to provide for the control of the sale, supply and 
distribution of drugs. 
The Department of Pharmaceuticals vide their 0.M.No.5/2/2005-PI-I/PI-II(Pt.) dated 
the 11th September, 2014 has stated therein that they proposes to repeal the whole Act. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No.86 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that the sale, supply and distribution of drugs are now controlled 
under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 (EC Act), since drugs have been included under 
essential commodities. The Drugs (Prices Control) Orders of 1995 and 2013 have both been 
issued by the central government in exercise of its powers under the EC Act. Thus, the Drugs 
(Control) Act, 1950 is now redundant, since no rules or orders currently operate under this 
Act. To avoid confusion with regard to the legal framework governing the pricing, supply and 
distribution of drugs, the Drugs (Control) Act, 1950 should be repealed. This would clear the 
air surrounding the pricing of drugs and assist stricter enforcement and prosecution of the 
Drugs (Control) Orders. In 2006, the 1950 Act was sought to be repealed for the above stated 
reasons. The Drugs (Control) Repeal Bill, 2006 was introduced in the Lok Sabha but it lapsed 
subsequently. Since circumstances have not changed since 2006, this Act is fit for repeal. It 
further stated that there are no legal issues that would impede repeal. 
It is understood that the Drugs (Control) Repeal Bill, 2006 (Bill No. 21 of 2006) was 
introduced in Lok Sabha on the 1st March, 2006. The statement of objects and reasons 
67 
appended to the said Bill, inter alia, stated that since price control is being done under the 
Essential Commodities Act, 1955, the Drugs (Control) Act, 1950 (see Part-II of Volume I) has 
become redundant and therefore, decided to repeal the aforesaid Act. 
In view of the above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
89. The Opium and Revenue Laws (Extension of Application) Act, 1950 
(33 of 1950) 
The P.C. Jain Commission in its Report at SI. No. 116 of Appendix A-1 (166 Central 
Acts recommended for repeal) had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at Sl. No. 22 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission, inter alia, observed 
that the aforesaid Act provided for the extension of certain opium and revenue laws to certain 
parts of India. By means of Section 2 of this Act, the Opium Act, 1857, Opium Act, 1878, 
Revenue Recovery Act, 1890, Government Trading Taxation Act, 1926, Dangerous Drugs 
Act, 1930, Taxation on Income (Investigation Commission) Act, 1947 and the Payment of 
Taxes (Transfer of Property) Act, 1949, and the rules and orders made thereunder which were 
in force immediately before the commencement of this Act in certain parts of India, were 
extended to the rest of India (except the State of Jammu and Kashmir). All these Acts so 
extended, except the Revenue Recovery Act, 1890, have now been repealed. Most States 
either have their own revenue recovery Acts or have introduced amendments to the Revenue 
Recovery Act, 1890 and consequently, this Act has fallen into disuse. Consequently, the 
Opium and Revenue Laws (Extension of Application) Act, 1950 has now become redundant. 
There is no evidence of recent use of this Act. 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted for the extension of certain opium and revenue 
laws to certain parts of India. The Laws mentioned in section 2 of the aforesaid Act are as 
under, namely:— 
(i) the Opium Act, 1857 (13 of 1857), 
(ii) the Opium Act, 1878 (1 of 1878), 
(iii) the Revenue Recovery Act, 1890 (1 of 1890), 
(iv) the Government Trading Taxation Act, 1926 (3 of 1926), 
(v) the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930 (2 of 1930), 
(vi) the Taxation on Income (Investigation Commission) Act, 1947 (30 of 1947), and 
(vii) the Payment of Taxes (Transfer of Property) Act, 1949(22 of 1949). 
Out of the seven Acts mentioned in the preceding paragraph, six Acts mentioned here 
under have already been repealed. Only the Revenue Recovery Act, 1890 (1 of 1890) is 
existing on the Statute Book. 
(i) the Opium Act, 1857 (13 of 1857) [Repealed by 61 of 1985], 
(ii) the Opium Act, 1878 (1 of 1878) [Repealed by Act 61 of 1985], 
(Hi) the Government Trading Taxation Act, 1926 (3 of 1926)[Repealed by Act 20 of 2000], 
(iv) the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930 (2 of 1930) [Repealed by Act 61 of 1985], 
(v) the Taxation on Income (Investigation Commission) Act, 1947 (30 of 1947) [Repealed 
by Act 20 of 2000], and 
(vi) the Payment of Taxes (Transfer of Property) Act, 1949(22 of 1949) [Repealed by Act 
20 of 2000]. 
The Opium and Revenue Laws (Extension of Application) Act, 1950 consists of four 
sections. Section 2 relates to extension of certain opium and revenue laws to certain parts of 
India which have been mentioned in the preceding paragraph. Section 3 contains provisions 
for modifications in State Laws relating to income-tax investigations under the Taxation on 
Income (Investigation Commission) Act, 1947. The aforesaid section, inter cilia, provided that 
68 
all cases referred to or pending before the State Commission (by whatever name called) 
in respect of matters relating to taxation on income other than agricultural income stand 
transferred to the Central Commission [Income-tax Investigation Commission constituted 
under the Taxation on Income (Investigation Commission) Act, 1947.The Taxation on Income 
(Investigation Commission) Act, 1947 under which Central Commission was to be appointed 
had been repealed by Act 20 of 2000. 
In view of the above, the Committee feels that nothing survives in the aforesaid 
Act after repeal of the Taxation on Income (Investigation Commission) Act, 1947 and 
therefore the aforesaid Act has become redundant and can be repealed in view of section 
6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897. 
90.The Preventive Detention (Amendment) Act, 1950 (50 of 1950) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted further to amend the Preventive Detention Act, 1950. 
The Preventive Detention Act, 1950 was in operation upto the 31st day of December, 1969 as 
extended by the Preventive Detention (Continuance) Act, 1966 (48 of 1966) and thereafter it 
has ceased to operate. The Preventive Detention (Continuance) Act, 1966 (48 of 1966) has 
been repealed by the Repealing and Amending Act, 1974 (56 of 1974).. 
Though the operation of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950 has ceased to operate yet 
it continues to exist on the Statute Book . Further, as per records made available to the 
Committee by the Legislative Department, no reference is found as to whether the Preventive 
Detention (Amendment) Act, 1950 is repealed. The Prevention Detention Act, 1950 has been 
identified for repeal at SI. No. 83 above. 
In view of the above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
91. The Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Amendment Act, 1950 
(52 of 1950) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted further to amend the Essential Supplies 
(Temporary Powers) Act, 1946. The aforesaid Act received the assent of the President on 
16th August, 1950. 
The Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946 was repealed by the Repealing 
and Amending Act, 1957 (36 of 1957). As per records made available to the Committee by the 
Legislative Department, no reference was found as to whether the aforesaid Act has been 
repealed. As the principal Act has been repealed nothing contained in the aforesaid 
amendment Act survives. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
92.The Cooch-Behar (Assimilation of Laws) Act, 1950 (67 of 1950) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to assimilate certain laws in force in Cooch-Behar 
to the laws in force in the rest of West Bengal when the territory of Cooch-Behar was made 
part of the State of West Bengal. All the provisions of the aforesaid Act have come into force 
on 01.01.1951 vide SR0.1106 dated 20.12.1950. 
The P.C. Jain Commission recommended for its repeal at SI. No. 112 of Appendix A-1 
(166 Central Acts recommended for repeal by the Central Government). 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at SI. No. 23 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission, inter alia, observed 
that the aforesaid Act assimilated certain laws in force in Cooch-Behar to the laws in force in 
the rest of West Bengal. Cooch-Bchar was a princely state in British India which was, post- 
69 
Independence, merged into the State of West Bengal by means of the States' Merger (West 
Bengal) Order, 1949. On the appointed day (as prescribed under this Act), all laws in force in 
the State of West Bengal were to come into force in Cooch-Behar. Simultaneously, all laws in 
force in Cooch-Behar were to cease to be in force. The purpose of this Act has been fulfilled. 
Hence, the Central Government should repeal this Act. 
Now, after the reorganization of States, territories of each of the States have been 
clearly delineated and the Laws are now applicable in the respective territory on the terms set 
out in the First Schedule to the Constitution of India. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the provisions of the aforesaid Act 
have now become redundant and can be repealed. 
93. The Indian Income-tax (Amendment) Act, 1950 (71 of 1950) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to amend the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 which has 
already been repealed by the Income-tax Act, 1961 (43 of 1961). As per records made 
available to the Committee by the Legislative Department, no reference was found as to 
whether the aforesaid Act has been repealed. As the principal Act has already been repealed, 
nothing contained in the aforesaid amendment Act survives. 
In view of the above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed.

(72 of 1950)

Powers) Act, 1946. The Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946 was repealed by 
the Repealing and Amending Act, 1957 (36 of 1957). As per records made available to the 
Committee no reference was found as to whether the aforesaid Act has been repealed. As the 
principal Act has been repealed, nothing contained in the aforesaid amendment Act survives. 
In view of the above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
95.The Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1951 (1 of 1951)

has been repealed by the section 484 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1974, which contains 
savings provisions. As the principal Act has been repealed, nothing contained in the aforesaid 
amending Act survives. 
In view of the above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed.

1908 and came into force with effect from 1st April, 1951 vide Notification number S.R.O.

commencement), section 19 containing special provisions explaining the operation of the Civil 
Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1922 (9 of 1922) and section 20 containing repeal and savings 
70 
provisions) were repealed by the Repealing and Amending Act, 1960 (58 of 1960). The Civil 
Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1922 (9 of 1922) has also been repealed and did not contain any 
substantive provision or transitional provision except conferring, inter alia, power upon the 
Local Government under sub-section (2) of section 1 of the aforesaid Act to extend throughout 
the province or part thereof and the aforesaid sub-section (2) reads as under:- 
"(2) The Local Government may, with the previous sanction of the Governor General in Council, by 
notification in the local Official Gazette, direct that this Act shall come into force throughout the Province 
or in any part thereof on such date as may be specified in the notification?. 
Attention is invited to section 19 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 
1951 which reads as under:- 
"Special provisions explaining operation of Act IX of 1922— 
19.— Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2) of section 1 of the Civil Procedure 
(Amendment) Act, 1922 (IX of 1922), but without prejudice to any action taken there under by any

the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1951, by this Act, shall not affect the

appended to the Act. Part B States were former princely states which were governed by a 
Rajpramukh. However, Part II States as they existed immediately post-Independence, do not 
exist now. The purpose of this Act has been fulfilled. Hence, the Central Government should 
repeal this Act. 
After the enactment of the States Reorganisation Act, 1956 and the Constitution 
(Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956, the classification of States as Part-A, Part-B and Part-C 
have been abolished and the First Schedule of the Constitution was substituted indicating 
therein the States and Union territories. 
Attention is invited to reasons for making amendments to the Constitution as 
mentioned in the Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Seventh 
Amendment) Act, 1956 which reads as under:— 
"The reorganisation scheme involves not only the establishment of new States and alterations in the area 
and boundaries of the existing States, but also the abolition of the three categories of States (Part A, Part 13 
and Part C States) and the classification of certain areas as Union territories. Article 1 has to be suitably 
amended for this purpose and the First Schedule completely revised.".

71 
State Reorganisation Act, 1956 and the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed.

As the principal Act has been repealed, nothing contained in the aforesaid amending 
legislation survives. Parliament has the Legislative competence in view of the aforesaid 
provision of the Constitution. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
102.The Part C States (Miscellaneous Laws) Repealing Act, 1951 
(66 of 1951) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to repeal certain laws in force in certain Part C 
States. The aforesaid Act is a repealing Act.

saving provision, which would also be incorporated in the Repealing Bill, 2014 so that, the 
Part C States (Miscellaneous Laws) Repealing Act, 1951can be repealed as per legislative 
practice to clean the statute Book. In the past, the Criminal Tribes Laws (Repeal) Act, 1952

103.The Part B States Marriages Validating Act, 1952(1 of 1952) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to validate certain marriages solemnized in certain 
Part-B States between the 26th  day of January, 1950 and the 31st  day of March, 1951 under the 
Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872. The aforesaid Act contains three sections [Section 1 for 
short title, section 2 for validation of certain irregular marriages and section 3 for validation of 
records of marriages validated by section 2]. 
The P.C. Jain Commission in its report at SI. No. 162 of Annexure-A-1 (166 Central 
Acts recommended for repeal by the Central Government), had recommended for repeal of the 
aforesaid Act after an appropriate saving clause. 
The Legislative Department vide their D.O. No. 11(29)/2014-Leg.I dated the 12th 
September, 2014 at 51. No. 52 in the Annexure appended thereto, recommended for repeal of 
the aforesaid Act, as it is of no relevance. 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at SI. No. 27 under Chapter 2 of the Report 
had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the earlier recommendations of 
the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission, inter alia, observed that the aforesaid Act 
validated certain marriages solemnized in certain Part B states between 26th January 1950 and 
31st March 1951, under the Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872. All these marriages were to 
be deemed to be good and valid in law as if such marriages had been solemnized by a person 
duly authorized to do so. The Act was clearly time-specific and has served its purpose. Hence, 
it should be repealed and a suitable savings clause should be inserted to the repealing Act. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act may be repealed after making 
following specific saving clause (in addition to general saving clause) on the following 
lines, namely:- 
"Without prejudice to the generality of provisions contained in section 4, the repeal of 
73 
the Part B States Marriages Validating Act, 1952, by this Act, shall not affect— 
(a) all marriages between persons one or both of whom is or are a Christian or 
Christians, which were solemnized in any erstwhile Part B State before the seventh 
amendment of the Constitution (other than the State of Jammu and Kashmir) between 
the 26th day of January, 1950 and the 31st day of March, 1951, under the Indian 
Christian Marriage Act, 1872, shall, notwithstanding such repeal be, and shall be 
deemed to have been with effect from the date of solemnization of each of them 
respectively, as good and valid in law before and after such repeal as if such marriages 
had been solemnized by a person duly authorised under the Part B States Marriages 
Validating Act, 1952,to solemnize such marriages in the erstwhile Part B State 
concerned; 
(b) certificates of marriages which are declared by clause (a) above to be good and 
valid in law, and register books, and certified copies of true and duly authenticated 
extracts there from, deposited or purporting to be deposited, before such repeal, in 
compliance with the provisions of the Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872, in so far 
as the register, books and extracts relate to such marriages as aforesaid, shall, after 
such repeal, be received as evidence of such marriages as if such marriages had been 
duly solemnized under that Act.". 
104. The Indian Independence Pakistan Courts (Pending Proceedings) Act, 
1952 (9 of 1952) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to render ineffective certain decrees and orders 
passed by courts in Pakistan against a Government in India and to provide an alternative 
remedy to persons who have secured such decrees or orders. 
The Law Commission in its 248th  Report at serial No. 59 under Chapter 4 of the 
Report, recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act and observed as under:- 
"This Act was enacted to render ineffective certain decrees and orders which were 
passed by courts in Pakistan, and to provide an alternative remedy to persons who 
had secured such decrees or orders. Hence, the Act catered to a temporary situation 
that existed subsequent to the partition of India. This Act was considered but not 
recommended for repeal by the 96th Law Commission Report, 1984. The Report said 
that even though it may appear that the need for the Act does not exist anymore, 'it is 
not possible to say with absolute certainty that no such suit as is governed by the Act 
can be filed at the present day.' However, another thirty years have passed since the 
96th Law Commission Report arrived at this conclusion. Further, the limitation 
clause in the Act specifies that no suits may be instituted under this Act after one 
year from the date of enactment or the date of decree, whichever is later. Thus, any 
new proceedings are clearly barred by limitation, and any pending proceedings may 
be saved by a suitable savings clause.". 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No.30 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that the aforesaid Act was passed to address a situation peculiar to 
the post-partition period, in regard to obligations created on the government by decrees passed 
by British-Indian Courts now in Pakistan, and allowing institution of fresh proceedings to 
aggrieved persons. Sixty two years hence, these circumstances no longer exist. It further 
mentions that the issue expressed by the Law Commission in its 96th Report (1984), while 
recommending against repeal of the Act, can now be addressed, since an additional 30 years 
have passed. The Law Commission considered the Act and recommended against its repeal, 
on the sole ground that it might affect any pending litigation. Although there is no conclusive 
way of establishing whether there is any pending litigation, the problem can be resolved by 
enacting a saving clause, alongside repeal, protecting all action taken under the Act. 
74 
r. 
Section 4 of the aforesaid Act, inter alio, provides that a person can institute fresh 
proceeding within one year from the commencement of the aforesaid Act or one year from the 
date of decree whichever is later. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed with 
the following specific saving clause, namely:- 
"Without prejudice to the generality of provisions contained in section 4, any person in 
whose favour a decree to which the Indian Independence Pakistan Courts (Pending 
Proceedings) Act, 1952 applied has been passed may, notwithstanding anything contained in 
section 3 of the Indian Limitation Act, 1908 and repeal of the Indian Independence Pakistan 
Courts (Pending Proceedings) Act, 1952, within a year from the date of the decree, institute a 
fresh suit or legal proceedings in respect of the cause of action on which such decrees was 
based, and any such suit or other legal proceeding may, notwithstanding anything contained in 
section 20 of the Code of Civil procedure, 1908, or in any other law or in any agreement to the 
country relating to the place of suing, be instituted in any court otherwise competent to try it, 
within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the person instituting it voluntarily resides or 
carries on business or personally works for gain and the repeal of the Indian Independence 
Pakistan Courts (Pending Proceedings) Act, 1952, shall not invalidate aforesaid decree or 
institution of such suit or other legal proceeding on the ground that the aforesaid Act has been 
repealed and such decrees shall be in force or such suit or other legal proceeding may be 
instituted as the aforesaid had not been repealed.".

Sections 2 to 73 and 75 to 83 of the aforesaid Act were repealed by the Repealing and 
Amending Act, 1960 (58 of 1960). Only sections 1, 74 and 84 of the Representation of the 
People (Second Amendment) Act, 1956 are existing. 
(i) existing section 74 of the Representation of the People (Second Amendment) Act, 
1956 provided omission of section 143 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 and 
removal of disqualification incurred under that section.

Both the aforesaid sections 74 and 84 of the Representation of the People (Second 
Amendment) Act, 1956 have become redundant as under: 
Section 74 of the Representation of the People (Second Amendment) Act, 1956 provided for -

contained provisions for disqualification arising out of failure to lodge statement of

(b) removing disqualifications for voting incurred by any person under the said section for 
82 
default in making a return of election expenses. 
Fifty-eight years have elapsed since enactment of aforesaid section 74 and therefore,

to mention here that the disqualification for failure to lodge account of election expenses 
under the present provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 are governed by 
section 10A which reads as under:— 
[Section 10A. Disqualification for failure to lodge account of election expenses. —If the Election

by or under this Act; and 
(b) has no good reason or justification for the failure, 
the Election Commission shall, by order published in the Official Gazette, declare him to be disqualified 
and any such person shall be disqualified for a period of three years from the date of the order.]. 
In view of above, saving clause contained in section 4 of the Repealing Bill, 2014 
and section 6 of General Clauses Act, 1894, the Committee feels that section 74 of the 
Representation of the People (Second Amendment) Act, 1956 can be repealed. 
Section 49 of the Representation of the People (Second Amendment) Act, 1956 
contained provisions for appointment of Election Tribunal which has been substituted by 
section 41 of the Representation of People (Amendment) Act, 1966 and conferred powers 
upon the High Court for trial of Election Petitions. Section 84 of the Representation of the 
People (Second Amendment) Act, 1956 contains saving provision in respect of election 
petitions before the Election Tribunals in certain cases. 
Since, Election Tribunals have been replaced by the High Court as mentioned above, 
the provisions of section 84 of the Representation of the People (Second Amendment) Act, 
1956 and section 84 contained provision for non-applicability of the aforesaid Act to the 
elections called before the commencement of the aforesaid Act i.e., 25th August, 1956 being 
the date of the commencement of the aforesaid Act. 
In view of above, saving clause contained in section 4 of the Repealing Bill, 2014 and 
section 6 of General Clauses Act, 1894, the Committee feels that section 84 of the 
Representation of the People (Second Amendment) Act, 1956 can be repealed. After the 
proposed repeal of section 74 and 84 of the Representation of the People (Second 
Amendment) Act, 1956, only sub-section (1) of section 1 of that Act relating to short title will 
remain. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
136. The Industrial Disputes (Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions) 
Act, 1956 (36 of 1956)

that the aforesaid Act amended the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and the Industrial 
Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946. Also, this Act repealed the Industrial Disputes 
(Appellate Tribunal) Act, 1950. The purpose of this Act has been served. Hence, this Act must 
be repealed. 
The Industrial Disputes (Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1956 
contains 33 sections. Sections 2 to 29 and section 32 have been repealed by the Repealing and 
83 
Amending Act, 1960 (58 of 1960). Only four section are surviving i.e. section 1 relates to 
short title and commencement, section 30 contains provisions for saving the proceedings 
which were pending before the Tribunal constituted under Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, 
section 31 providing for not to have any overriding effect on any State laws and section 33 
contains provisions for repeal of the Industrial Disputes (Appellate Tribunal) Act, 1950 (48 of 
1950) and saving the proceedings pending under the said repealed Act. 
Though the aforesaid surviving sections were transitory provisions and now these 
provisions have served their utility and become redundant now. Further, as per records made 
available to the Committee, no reference was found as to whether the remaining provisions 
have been repealed. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed after making a 
specific saving clause in respect of aforesaid section 30 and 31 on the following lines, 
namely:— 
"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in section 4,- 
(a) if, immediately before the commencement of this Act, there has been pending any 
proceeding in relation to an industrial dispute before a Tribunal constituted under the 
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, as in force before such commencement, the dispute may 
be adjudicated and the proceeding disposed of by that Tribunal after such 
commencement, as if Industrial Disputes (Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions) 
Act, 1956 had not been passed; 
(b) if, immediately before the commencement of this Act, there is in force in any State 
any Provincial Act or State Act relating to the settlement or adjudication of disputes, the 
operation of such an Act in that State in relation to matters covered by that Act shall not 
be affected by the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, as amended by Industrial Disputes 
(Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1956 after its repeal; 
(c) nothing in the aforesaid clause (a) or clause (b) shall be deemed to preclude the 
Central Government or the National Tribunal from exercising any powers conferred on 
it by the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, as amended by Industrial Disputes (Amendment 
and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1956 after its repeal.". 
137.The Newspaper (Price and Page) Act, 1956 (45 of 1956) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for regulation of the prices charged for 
newspapers in relation to their pages and of matters connected for the purpose of preventing 
unfair competition among newspapers so that news papers may have fuller opportunities of 
freedom of expression. 
The Law Commission, in its 248th  Report at Sl. No. 61 under Chapter 4 of the Report, 
has considered the aforesaid Act and stated that the same was enacted to provide for the 
regulation of the prices charged for newspapers in relation to their pages so as to prevent 
unfair competition among newspapers. It further stated that section 3 of the aforesaid Act 
empowered the Central Government to make orders providing for the regulation of the prices 
charged for newspapers in relation to their maximum or minimum number of pages, sizes or 
areas and for the space to be allotted for advertisements and section 3 was struck down in 
Sakai Papers Pvt Ltd. v. Union of India [AIR 1962 SC 305] for violating Article 19(1)(a). It 
further states that since the main provision, i.e., Section 3, has been struck down, fresh orders 
cannot be issued under the Act. Consequently, the Act serves no purpose, but remains on the 
statute books and should be repealed. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No.101 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that the main provision of the aforesaid Act, section 3, was struck 
down by the Supreme Court in Sakai Papers Pvt. Ltd. and Ors. v. Union of India, on the 
ground that it violated the freedom of speech and expression of the petitioners. The Hon'ble 
84 
Supreme Court held that the State could not make laws which directly affected the circulation 
of 'a newspaper for that would amount to violation of freedom of speech. The right under 
Article 19(1)(a) of Constitution of India, extends not only to the matter which the citizens are 
entitled to circulate but to the volume of circulation. Though section 3 was struck down, the 
rest of the aforesaid Act continues to remain on the statute books. It is a dead letter for all 
purposes. The Supreme Court itself noted in Sakai Papers that if section 3 of the aforesaid Act 
, is struck down, nothing remains in the Act. Since section 3 of the aforesaid Act has been done 
away with, the power of the Central Government to make an order under the aforesaid Act no 
longer exists and provisions imposing penalties on the contravention of such orders are 
redundant. The print media has undergone a drastic transformation and the number of 
newspapers in circulation itself acts as a safeguard against unfair competition. The total 
number of registered newspapers in India till 2010-11 was 82,237. Powers granted by the 
aforesaid Act restrict the freedom of occupation, trade and business, and have no place in a 
liberalised economy. There arc no legal issues that would impede repeal. 
In view of the above, the aforesaid Act can be repealed.

Section 3 contains special provision for nomination in case of prisoners in Portuguese territory

aforesaid Act i.e., date of assent of the President i.e., 28th December, 1956 as there is no

for prisoners in Portuguese territory at any election that might be held within one year from

take a view in this regard. Since section 1 and section 5 of the aforesaid Act are in force, 
the Committee feels that the provisions of the aforesaid Act has outlived its utility and 
become redundant and can be repealed after making a saving clause (if aforesaid • 
Council of Advisors exist) on the following lines, if required, namely:— 
"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in section 4, the 
holding of the office of member of the Council of Advisers associated with the Chief 
Commissioner of Manipur or with the Chief Commissioner of Tripura, (if existing on the

not, disqualify on or before, after such repeal the holder thereof for being chosen as, or for

149. The Young Persons (Harmful Publications) Act, 1956 (93 of 1956) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to prevent the dissemination of certain publications 
harmful to young persons. 
88 
The P.C. Jain Commission in its Report at Si. 19 of Appendix A-I (166 Central Acts 
recommended for repeal by the Central Government) has recommended for repeal of the 
aforesaid Act. 
The Law Commission in its 248th  Report has recommended for repeal of the aforesaid 
Act at Si. No. 63 under Chapter 4 of the Report and stated that the aforesaid Act was enacted 
to prevent the dissemination of certain publications considered harmful to young persons. 
`Young person' has been defined under the aforesaid Act as a person under the age of 21 years 
which is inconsonant with several other legislations defining the age of majority. It further 
stated that multiple laws govern this area—The IPC penalizes speech and publications in 
various forms. The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 was enacted, inter 
alia, to protect children from analogous harmful publications. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No.100 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that the words such as repulsive and horrible contained in the 
definition of harmful publication are vague and subject to arbitrary interpretation, and 
consequently lead to widespread discretion and serve as an excuse for harassment. For 
instance, earlier this year Kerala Police raided shops that sold Bob Marley T-shirts, on the 
ground that these encourage youngsters to use drugs, and booked shopkeepers under the Act 
for promoting material that is harmful to youngsters. India already has a variety of laws that 
penalise speech in various forms, like speech which causes incitement to an offence (Section 
504, Indian Penal Code (IPC) or leads to or has a tendency to cause violence like anti-national 
speech (Section 124A IPC), speech that is communal, racial, linguistic and indecent (Section 
I 53A), anti-sovereignty speech (Section 153B), speech that outrages religious feelings 
(Section 295A), is obscene (Section 292), or is anti scheduled caste and scheduled tribe (SC 
and ST Act, 1989 and Protection of Human Rights Act, 1976). Recently, the Protection of 
Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 was brought into force to protect children from 
sexual assault, sexual harassment and pornography. Given the existence of all of these acts, 
this Act is repetitive and redundant. Indian law also provides for regulation of content on 
media. Under the Indian legal regime, Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995, the 
Press Council of India Act, 1978, and Cable Television Networks (Amendment) Rules, 2006 
(Rules) are the principal legislations which control the content on television to ensure that they 
do not offend morality, decency and religious susceptibilities of the consumers. The 
Information Technology Act, 2000 regulates content on the internet, while the Censor Board 
for films. The aforesaid Act does not seem to be implemented and appears to have a low rate 
of prosecution. It further stated that repeal of the aforesaid Act will impact pending cases 
instituted under the aforesaid Act. Along with repeal, a clause can be enacted to save 
application of the Act on pending cases. 
The Committee feels that section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 would save the 
pending cases instituted and pending under the aforesaid Act. Section 6 of the General Clauses 
Act, 1897 reads as under:— 
[Section 6. Effect of repeal.- Where this Act, or any Central Act or Regulation made after the 
commencement of this Act, repeals any enactment hitherto made or hereafter to be made, then, 
unless a different intention appears, the repeal shall not- 
(a) revive anything not in force or existing at the time at which the repeal takes effect; or 
(b) affect the previous operation of any enactment so repealed or anything duly done or 
suffered there under; or 
(c) affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under 
any enactment so repealed; or 
(d) affect any penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of any offence committed 
against any enactment so repealed; or 
(e) affect any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any such right, 
89 
privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid; 
and any such investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced, 
and any such penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be imposed as if the repealing Act or Regulation 
had not been passed.] 
In view of above, the aforesaid Act can be repealed.

commencement. Section 2 relates to definition. Section 3 contains exemption from 
application of the aforesaid Act to certain premises. Section 4 contains provisions for 
temporary protection to certain classes of tenants from eviction and section 5 contains 
provisions for excluding time from limitation for the purposes of the aforesaid Act. 
The provisions of aforesaid Act have ceased to operate in terms of sub-section (4) of 
section 1 of the aforesaid Act, as amended by the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 (59 of 1958). 
The aforesaid sub-section (4) of section 1 (which was substituted by Act 59 of 1958) reads as 
under:- 
" (4) It shall cease to have effect,— 
(a) as respects premises other than vacant ground on the 11th day of February, 1959; 
(b) as respects premises which are vacant ground, on the I 1th day of February, 1960; 
except as respects things done or omitted to be done before such cesser of operation of this Act and 
section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 shall apply upon such cesser of operation as it had been 
repealed by a Central Act.". 
The provisions of the aforesaid Act have ceased to have effect and become redundant. 
As per records made available to the Committee by the Legislative Department, no reference 
was found as to whether the aforesaid Act has been repealed. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed.

from the 1st June, 1960 vide Notification No. S.O. 1046 dated the 26th April, 1960 [Gazette of 
India, Pt-II, Section 3(ii) p-1358]. The aforesaid section 22 inserted a new section 24A in the 
Motor Vehicles Act, 1939. The Motor vehicles Act, 1939 was repealed by section 217 of the 
Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (59 of 1988). As per records made available to the Committee, no 
reference was found as to whether the aforesaid Act has been repealed. 
As the principal Act i.e., the Motor vehicles Act, 1939 has already been repealed, 
nothing contained in the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 1956 survives. Further, as per 
records made available to the Committee by the Legislative Department, no reference was 
found as to whether the aforesaid Act has been repealed. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed.

(105 of 1956) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the licensing of institutions for 
women and children and for matters incidental thereto. 
90 
The Law Commission in its 248th  Report at Si. No. 64 under Chapter 4 of the Report 
has recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act and stated that the Act provides for the 
licensing of institutions for women and children and the Institution under the Act are 
established and maintained for the reception, care, protection and welfare of women and 
children. It further stated that the Ministry of Women and Child Development had said in 
2012 that the 1956 Act has no value and stood repealed after the Juvenile Justice (Care and 
Protection of Children) Act, 2000 came into force. It further stated that this stand taken by the 
Ministry was also affirmed by the I-figh Court of Delhi in 2014 in Chhatravas, Chandra Arya 
Vidya Mandir Vs. The Director, Department of Women and Child Development and Anr. 
[MANU/DE/0566/20141. 
The Law Commission also stated that there should be clarity in this respect and the 
repeal of the 1956 Act should be brought about by amending the existing repeal and savings 
clause of the 2000 Act (which does not currently mention the 1956 Act). 
The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Bill, 2014 (Bill No. 99 of 2014) 
was introduced in the Rajya Sabha in the Budget Session of Parliament which consist of a 
provision for repeal of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000. The 
concerned Ministry/Department and the Legislative Department may consider to amend the 
Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Bill, 2014 in the light of the above 
observations of the Law Commission in its 248th Report instead of amending the Juvenile 
Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 (56 of 2000). 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed 
153.The Finance Act, 1957 (5 of 1957) 
The Committee feels that only four sections 1, 3, 4 and 6 are surviving in the aforesaid 
Act i.e., section 3 for amending the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 and section 4 for amending 
the Indian Tariff (Amendment) Act, 1949 and section 6 for discontinuance of salt duty. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed after making a special 
saving clause in respect of section 6 on the following lines, namely:— 
"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in section 4, the repeal 
of the Finance Act, 1957, shall not revive the provisions of section 6 of that Act (unless said

Amending Act, 1960 (58 of 1960) (sections 2 to 17). Only section 1 relating to short title and 
commencement and section 18 for transfer of pending proceedings before the Railway Rates 
Tribunal constituted under the Indian Railways Act, 1890 to the new Tribunal constituted 
under section 34 of the Indian Railways Act, 1890, as amended by the Indian Railways 
(Amendment) Act, 1957 are existing. 
Since, the Indian Railways Act, 1890 has been repealed as mentioned above, and fifty-
seven years have elapsed since making a provision for transfer of pending proceedings to the

92 
become redundant.

reference was found as to whether remaining two sections of this Act have been repealed. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed.

thereafter it has ceased to operate. The Preventive Detention (Continuance) Act, 1966 (48 of 
1966) has been repealed by the Repealing and Amending Act, 1974 (56 of 1974).

it continues to exist on the Statute Book . Further, as per records made available to the 
Committee by the Legislative Department, no reference is found as to whether the Preventive 
Detention (Amendment) Act, 1950 is repealed. The Prevention Detention Act, 1950 has been 
identified for repeal at SI. No. 83 above. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
160. The Prevention of Disqualification (Amendment) Act, 1957 
(64 of 1957) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to amend the Prevention of Disqualification Act, 
1953 (1 of 1954)(principal Act) which had been repealed by the Parliament (Prevention of 
Disqualification) Act, 1959 (10 of 1959) and as per records made available to the Committee 
by the Legislative Department, no reference was found as to whether this amendment Act has 
been repealed.

161.The Control of Shipping (Continuance) Act, 1958 (9 of 1958) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to continue the Control of Shipping Act, 1947 
(principal Act) for a further period. The Control of Shipping Act, 1947 has been repealed by 
the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 (44 of 1958) .

the Legislative Department, no reference was found as to whether the aforesaid Act has been 
repealed. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
162.The Finance Act, 1958 (11 of 1958) 
The Committee feels that sections 3 to 12 amending the Indian Income-tax, 1922, 
section 14 amending the Wealth-tax Act, 1957, section 15 amending the Indian Tariff Act, 
1934 and section 17 amending the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944 (short title as it stood 
before its amendment) can be repealed. 
163. The Gift-tax Act,1958 (18 of 1958) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to provide for the levy of gift-tax. 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th Report at SI. No. 35 under Chapter 2 of the 
93 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. The Law Commission, inter alia, 
observed that the aforesaid Act provided for the levy of gift-tax. The Act charged for every 
assessment year a tax referred to as gift-tax in respect of the gifts, if any, made by a person 
during the previous year at the rate(s) specified in the Schedule appended to the Act. 
However, gift-tax was abolished as per Section 75 of the Finance Act, 1998. Consequently, 
the Act ceased to have effect after 1st October 1998. Due to misuse of the abolition of gift-tax 
in the form of widespread transfer of insincere gifts from non-relatives, Section 56(2)(v) of the 
Income Tax Act, 1961 was enacted. According to Section 56(2)(v), any amount exceeding Rs. 
25,000 obtained by a person or a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) without any consideration 
from any person on or after 1st September 2004 but before 1st April 2006 would be taxed. 
Since this amendment was made into the Income Tax Act, 1961, the Gift-Tax Act, 1958 is still 
not in force. The Act has been kept in abeyance and still remains on the statute book. The 
Central Government should formally repeal this Act. If the need to impose gift-tax arises, the 
same can be met with enacting a new law on gift-tax, whenever necessary. 
The aforesaid Act was amended by sub-section (3) of section 75 of the Finance Act 
(No. 2) Act, 1998, by which the applicability of Gift-tax has ceased to exist. 
In section 3 of the Gift-tax Act,1958, the following sub-section (3) was inserted by 
section 75 of the Finance Act (No. 2) Act,1998, namely:- 
[Section 3(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), the provisions of this Act 
shall cease to apply and shall have no effect whatsoever in respect of any gift made on or after 
the 1st day of October, 1998.] 
Sixteen years have lapsed from cessation of applicability of the Gift-tax Act, 1958 by 
section 75 of the Finance (No.2) Act, 1998. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act may be repealed after making a 
specific saving clause, on the following lines, namely:— 
"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in section 4, 
notwithstanding the repeal of the Gift-tax Act, 1958 by this Act, — 
(a) where a gift has been made to which the provisions of the Gift-tax Act, 1958 were 
applicable or not applicable under the said Act, the provisions of the Gift-tax Act, 1958, • 
as it stood before the 1st day of October, 1998, shall, notwithstanding such repeal, apply 
to such gift as if this Act had not been passed; 
(b) where a return of gift-tax has been filed, under the Gift-tax Act, 1958, as it stood before 
such repeal, by any person for any assessment year, proceedings for the assessment of • 
that person for that year may be taken and continued as if this Act had not been passed; 
(c) any proceeding pending on the commencement of this Act before any Gift-tax Officer, 
the Appellate Tribunal or any court, by way of appeal, reference, or revision, under the 
Gift-tax Act, 1958, as it stood before such repeal, shall be continued and disposed of as 
if this Act had not been passed; 
(d) any proceeding for the imposition of a penalty in respect of any assessment before the 
repeal of the Gift-tax Act, 1958, as it stood before such repeal, may be initiated and any 
such penalty may be imposed as if this Act had not been passed; 
(e) where, in respect of any assessment completed before the repeal of the Gift-tax Act, 
1958, as it stood before such repeal, a refund, if any, pending before such repeal, or 
default is made before such repeal, in the payment of any sum due under the assessment 
completed under the Gift-tax Act, 1958, as it stood before such repeal, such refund or 
sum due shall be made as if this Act had not been passed; 
(0 any sum payable by way of Gift-tax, interest, penalty or otherwise under the Gift-tax 
Act, 1958, as it stood before such repeal, may be recovered, but without prejudice to 
any action already taken for the recovery of such sum under that Act as if this Act had 
94 
not been passed; 
(g) any agreement entered into, appointment made, approval given, recognition granted, 
direction, instruction, notification, order or rule issued under any provision of under the 
Gift-tax Act, 1958, as it stood before such repeal, shall be deemed to have been entered 
into, made, granted, given or issued under the Gift-tax Act, 1958, as it stood before such 
repeal, and shall, continue in force accordingly as if this Act had not been passed.".

repealed.

certain cases. The Income-tax Act, 1961 contains saving provisions in respect of the Indian 
Income-tax Act, 1922 so repealed.

Expenditure-tax Act, 1957, section 27 amending the Gift-tax Act, 1958, section 28 amending

liabilities of that Board was transferred to and vested in the Coal Board constituted under Coal 
Mines (Conservation and Safety) Act, 1952 and also validated the action taken by the Coal 
Grading Board. The Committee feels that the Act served its purpose and has become obsolete 
and can be repealed. The draft Repealing Bill, 2014 also contains a saving clause. 
The Committee feels that the Coal Grading Board (Repeal) Act, 1959 can be 
repealed as per legislative practice to clean the Statutes Book. In the past, the Criminal 
Tribes Laws (Repeal) Act, 1952 (24 of 1952), has been repealed by the Repealing and 
Amending Act, 1957 (36 of 1957), the Press Council (Repeal) Act, 1976 (24 of 1976) has

necessitated on account of change in territorial extent brought about by the reorganization of 
the States on first day of November, 1956. Section 19 validated certain acts. Section 18 and 19 
were transitory provisions. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can also be repealed after making 
specific saving clause in the Repealing Bill, 2014, on the following lines, namely:—
"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in section 4, the repeal, 
 
of the Pharmacy (Amendment) Act, 1959 (hereafter referred to as the repealed Act) shall not

The Law Commission in its Ninety-sixth Report (March, 1984) inter alia opined that it 
is possible that suits to which the aforesaid applies can still be find or pending. If, so, its repeal 
may create avoidable controversies and it is not advisable to repeal the Act.

repealed, inter alia, stated that the aforesaid Act was only applicable to the period between 
1949 and 1954. The aforesaid Act sought to provide protection to property in the nature of 
public wakfs, which were dispossessed in the given period. As per section 3 of the aforesaid 
Act, the period of limitation for institution of suit extended only until 31st December, 1970. 
Although the Government could further extend the limitation period through an amendment, it 
has not done so since 1970. It further stated that there are no legal issues that would impede 
repeal. 
The Legislative Department, being the Ministry administering this Act, had stated vide 
D.O. No. 11(29)/2014-L.1 dated the 12th September, 2014 in the Annexure appended thereto

any interest therein during the period beginning after 14th day of August, 1947 and ending at 
the 7th day of May, 1954.

repealed after saving on the following lines, namely :- 
"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in section 4, the repeal 
of the Public Wakfs (Extension of Limitation) Act, 1959 shall not affect any action arising 
(including institution of any suit or possession of immovable property or dispossession or 
discontinuance of possession of immovable property or any order of any court) during the

of the Miscellaneous Personal Laws (Extension) Act, 1959 shall not affect the extension and 
amendments of the Acts specified in the Schedule I and Schedule II to the aforesaid Act and

recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. The P.C. Jain Commission in its Report at 51. 
No.9 of Appendix A-1 (166 Central Acts recommended for repeal by the Central Government)

revenue; persons liable to payment of tax under the Income-Tax Act, 1961; holders of 
immovable properties situated in urban areas assessed to tax; employees of the Government 
and local authorities, and dealers whose annual turnover is Rs. 15,000 or more and who are

Report on Repeal and Amendment of Laws has documented the Department of Economic

Affairs for proposing repeal of this Act was that in future any occasion or necessity for such 
compulsory deposits will not arise. Hence, the Department proposed repeal of this Act while

enactments. Consequently, the Central Government should repeal this Act. A suitable savings 
clause should be inserted in the repealing Act.

"(3)(a)Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, the Legislative Assembly shall have power to make

territories except matters with respect to Entries 1, 2 and 18 of the State List and Entries 64, 65 and 66

"18.Land, that is to say, rights in or over land, land tenures including the relation of landlord and tenant, 
and the collection of rents; transfer and alienation of agricultural land; land improvement and agricultural

The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed after making a specific 
saving clause on the following lines, namely: 
"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in section 4 and 
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Delhi Land Reforms Act, 1954 or in 
any other law for the time being in force or in any judgment, decree or order of any court and

under any of the clauses (a) to (h) of sub-section (1) of section 13, of the Delhi Land 
115 
Reforms Act, 1954, made before the 5th day of February, 1966, by the Deputy 
Commissioner or a Revenue Assistant (whether or not such Revenue Assistant was 
empowered by the Chief Commissioner to discharge all or any of the functions of a

have always been, made by such Deputy Commissioner, or, as the case may be, 
Revenue Assistant in accordance with law and the persons or class of persons or the 
tenants or class of tenants in whose favour any such declaration has been made shall be 
deemed to have been validly and lawfully declared as Bhumidhars as if the Delhi Land 
Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1966 had not been repealed: 
Provided that nothing herein contained shall affect the right of any person to

been deemed to have abated on that date shall, before and after such repeal, be deemed 
to have been abated as if the Delhi Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1966 had not been 
repealed.". 
218.The Finance Act, 1966 (13 of 1966) 
The Committee feels that sections 4 to 37 amending the Income-tax Act, 1961, section 
38 amending the Estate Duty Act, 1953 (which had been repealed), section 41 amending the 
Gift-tax Act, 1958 (proposed to be repealed at 51. No. 161), section 42 repealing the Super 
Profit Tax Act, 1963, section 43 amending the Companies (Profits) Surtax Act, 1964, section 
47 amending the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944 (short title as it stood before its. 
amendment), section 51 amending the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, section 52 amending the

219.The Merchant Shipping (Amendment) Act, 1966 (21 of 1966) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted further to amend the Indian Merchant Shipping 
Act, 1923 (21 of 1923). 
The aforesaid Act came into force on the 28th day of May, 1966 as provided by sub- 
section (2) of section 1 of the aforesaid Act. Sections 2 to 39 of the aforesaid Act had been 
repealed by the Repealing and Amending Act, 1974 (56 of 1974) and only section 1, section 
40 and section 41 exist. Aforesaid section 40 provides that certain contraventions etc. not to be 
offences. 
The Indian Merchant Shipping Act, 1923 (21 of 1923) was repealed by Part I of 
Schedule to the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 (44 of 1958). 
As per records made available to the Committee by the Legislative Department, no 
reference has been found as to whether the aforesaid amendment Act has been repealed. Since 
the principal Act i.e., the Merchant Shipping Act, 1923 had already been repealed, nothing 
survives in the amendment Act i.e., the Indian Merchant Shipping (Amendment) Act, 1966. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed after making a 
specific saving clause in respect of aforesaid section 40 on the following lines, namely:— 
"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in section 4, any 
person who was not guilty of an offence for the contravention for failure provided under 
116 
section 40 of the Indian Merchant Shipping (Amendment) Act, 1966, as it stood before its 
repeal by this Act, shall continue to be so after the repeal of the Indian Merchant Shipping 
(Amendment) Act, 1966 as if the said 'Act had not been repealed.". 
220. The Electricity (Supply) Amendment Act, 1966 (30 of 1966) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted further to amend the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948. 
The aforesaid Acts contains twenty-four sections out of which sections 2 to 23 had 
been repealed by the Repealing and Amending Act, 1974 (56 of 1974). Section 24 provides 
for validating the imposition and collection of charges for supply of electricity under section 
49 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 before the commencement of the aforesaid Act. 
The Committee noted that the Act served the purpose and has become redundant. The 
Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 has been repealed by the Electricity Act, 2003 (36 of 2003) and 
section 185 of the Electricity Act, 2003 contains saving provisions. Thus nothing survive in 
the Electricity (Supply) Amendment Act, 1966. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
221.The Companies (Second Amendment) Act, 1966 (37 of 1966) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted further to amend the Companies Act, 1956. 
The Companies Act, 1956 has been repealed and re-enacted as the Companies Act, 
2013 (18 of 2013). As per records made available to the Committee, no reference was found 
as to whether the aforesaid Act has been repealed. 
The aforesaid Act contains four sections out of which section 3 contains certain 
validations. The concerned Ministry may consider whether the saving clause provided under 
the Companies Act, 2013 would suffice for validation or validation be provided in the 
Repealing Bill, 2014. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed after making a 
specific saving clause on the following lines, namely:- 
"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in section 4, the 
repeal of the Companies (Second Amendment) Act, 1966 shall, notwithstanding any 
judgment, decree or order of any court or tribunal to the contrary, or anything contained in any 
law for the time being in force, not affect, before and after such repeal, any order, rule, 
regulation or appointment made, direction given or thing done, by then Chairman or any other 
member of the Company Law Board, acting individually, before the commencement of the 
Companies (Amendment) Act, 1965 and such order, rule, regulation or appointment made, 
direction given or thing done shall be deemed to be valid, or ever to have become invalid, by 
reason only of the fact that such Chairman or other member, acting individually, had no power 
to make such order, rule, regulation or appointment or give such direction or do such thing and 
every such order, rule, regulation or appointment made and every such direction given and 
thing done shall be deemed to have been made, given or done, as the case may be, by the 
Company Law Board as if the aforesaid Act had not been repealed.". 
222.The Representation of the People (Amendment) Act, 1966 (47 of 1966) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted further to amend the Representation of the People 
Act, 1950 and the Representation of the People Act, 1951. Except sections 1, 3, 61 and 63, all 
other sections had been repealed by the Repealing and Amending Act, 1974 (57 of 1974). 
The provisions of section 3 of the aforesaid Act provides that the members 
representing in the House of People immediately before 14.12.1966 [being the date of 
commencement of the aforesaid Act] from certain States and Union territories as mentioned in 
117 
aforesaid section 3 [such States and UTs, being the States of Jammu and Kashmir, State of 
Nagaland and Union territories of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the Laccadive, Minicoy and 
Amindivi Islands and Dadra and Nagar Haveli] shall continue to represent until dissolution of 
that House or if any vacancy was arisen against those seats then that would be filled by the 
nomination of the President. The Committee feels that the aforesaid section after efflux of 
time i.e., after fifty-one year has become redundant. 
Section 61 of the aforesaid Act omitted section 137 of the Representation of the People 
Act, 1951 and continuing any inquiry or proceeding pending before such omission by the 
Election Commission and imposition of any penalty or punishment thereof. The aforesaid 
section 61 proviso thereto reads as under:— 
"61. Section 137 of the 1951- Act shall be omitted: 
Provided that such omission shall not affect any inquiry or other proceeding under the said section 
pending immediately before such omission and any such inquiry or other proceeding may be continued 
and any prosecution may be instituted as a result of such inquiry or other proceeding and any penalty or 
punishment may be imposed under and in accordance with the said section as if that section had not been 
omitted." 
Section 137 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951- Act before its omission reads as 
under: "137. Prosecution regarding certain offences.-(1) If the Election Commission or a Regional 
Commissioner appointed under clause (4) of article 324 or the Chief Electoral Officer of the State has 
reason to believe that any offence punishable under section 129, or under section 134 or under clause (a) 
of sub-section (2) of section 136 has been committed in reference to any election within a State, it shall 
be the duty of the Election Commission, the Regional Commissioner or the Chief Electoral Officer, as 
the case may be, to cause such inquiries to be made and such prosecutions to be instituted as the 
circumstances of the case may appear to it or him to require. 
(2) No court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 129 or under section 134 or . 
under clause (a) of sub-section (2) of section 136 unless there is a complaint made by order of, or under 
authority from, the Election Commission or a Regional Commissioner appointed under clause (4) of 
article 324 or the Chief Electoral Officer of the State concerned.". 
Further, section 63 of the aforesaid Act provided for non-application of the provisions 
of the aforesaid Act on any elections which were called before the commencement of the 
Representation of the People (Amendment) Act, 1966 (14.12.1966 being the date of 
commencement of this Act) or to any election petition arising out of such elections. Aforesaid 
section 63 contains provisions which were transitory in nature and has now becomes 
redundant. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed after making a 
specific saving clause in respect of proviso to aforesaid section 61, on the following lines, 
namely:— 
"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in section 4, the omission of 
section 137 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, by the Representation of the People 
(Amendment) Act, 1966, shall, notwithstanding the repeal of the Representation of the People 
(Amendment) Act, 1966, not, affect any inquiry or other proceeding instituted immediately 
before 14th December, 1966 (being the date of omission of the aforesaid section 137) under 
the aforesaid section or continues thereof after such repeal, and any such inquiry or other 
proceeding, if pending on the date of such repeal, may be continued after such repeal and any 
prosecution may be instituted as a result of such inquiry or other proceeding and any penalty 
or punishment may be imposed in accordance with the said section as if that section had not 
been omitted, as provided under the Representation of the People (Amendment) Act, 1966 • 
before its repeal.". 
223.The Finance Act, 1967 (12 of 1967) 
118 
The aforesaid Act has five sections out of which sections 2 and 3 had been repealed by 
the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1967. 
Section 4 deals with the amendment in the Indian Tariff (Amendment) Act, 1949 and 
section 5 exempts levy of duty on the manufacture of salt under the Central Excise and Salt 
Act, 1944 (short title as it stood before its amendment) or import of duty on the Indian Tariff 
Act, 1934 for the year beginning on the 1st day of April, 1967. It was observed from the 
Finance Act enacted during the preceding and succeeding financial years that the aforesaid 
duty on the salt has been exempted on year to year basis. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed making a specific 
saving clause in respect of aforesaid duty on salt on the following lines, namely:— 
"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in section 4, the repeal 
of the Finance Act, 1967, shall not revive the provisions of section 5 of that Act (unless the 
said section 5 has been otherwise repealed or amended by any other Act).". 
224.The Land Acquisition (Amendment and Validation) Act, 1967 
(13 of 1967) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to amend the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 and to 
validate certain acquisition of land under the said Act. 
Sections 2 and 3 of the Land Acquisition (Amendment and Validation) Act, 1967 had 
been repealed by the Repealing and Amending Act, 1974 (56 of 1974). Only Section 1 and 4 
are surviving. Section 4 provides for validation of certain acquisitions made under the Land 
Acquisition Act, 1894 before the commencement of the Land Acquisition (Amendment and 
Validation) Ordinance, 1967. 
The Department of Land Resources vide its OM No. 13011/6/2013-LRD dated 23rd 
September, 2014 has attached the opinion of Department of Legal Affairs which states as 
under:- 
"The Principal Act Land Acquisition Act, 1894 has been amended by two times vide two Act i.e. Land 
Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1962 and Land Acquisition (Amendment and Validation) Act, 1967. In 
this way both Acts i.e., Act 1962 and Act 1967 have become part and partial parts of the Principal Act 
1894, which has been repealed by section 114 of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in 
Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. Hence the question existence of both acts 
do not arise while the Principal Act i.e. Act 1894 has been repealed by Act 2013.". 
The P.C. Jain Commission in its Report at SI. No. 67 of Appendix A-1 (166 Central 
Acts recommended for repeal) had recommended repeal of the aforesaid Act. 
The Law Commission in its 248th  report at Sl. No. 69 under Chapter 4 of the Report 
had, inter alia, recommended for repeal of this Act and observed that this Act was enacted to 
amend the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 and to validate certain acquisitions. The purpose of this 
Act has also been fulfilled. Further, as already mentioned the 1894 Act has been repealed. 
The Committee would like to record that any Act unless it is repealed remains on the 
Statutes book. It may be stated that section 4 of the aforesaid Act is an independent provision 
and does have implications. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed after 
making a specific saving clause in respect of section 4 of the aforesaid Act, which 
provides for validation of certain acquisitions, on the following lines, namely:— 
"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in section 4, the 
repeal of the Land Acquisition (Amendment and Validation) Act, 1967, shall not affect the 
matters covered under section 4 of the aforesaid Act (including the acquisition of land made 
and validation thereof, the calculation and payment of rate of interest and compensation and 
other provisions relating thereto), as it stood before its repeal.". 
119 
225.The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 1967 (14 of 1967) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to amend the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 
and to continue for a further period. 
The aforesaid Act contains five sections. Sections 2 and 4 had been repealed by the 
Repealing and Amending Act, 1974 (56 of 1974). Only sections 1, 3 and 5 are now surviving. 
Section 1 relates to short title thereof and duration, Section 3 provides for validating the ' 
closure of cotton textile mills on certain days during the period 12.02.1966 and 23.12.1966 
(both days inclusive) in pursuance of the decision taken by the Government of India and the 
employer was mandated to pay compensation for such closure to the person employed in the 
undertaking at the prevailing rate and section 5 contains provisions for repeal and saving of 
the Essential Commodities (Second Amendment) Ordinance, 1966. 
The Committee feels that the Act served its purpose and outlived the utility and 
thus can be repealed after making a specific saving clause, on the following lines, 
namely:— 
"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in section 4, the repeal 
of the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 1967, shall not affect the liability of the 
employer to pay compensation for closure of the undertakings to the persons employed 
(including badli workmen) as provided under clause (b) of section 3 of the aforesaid Act as it 
stood before such repeal.". 
226.The Finance (No. 2) Act, 1967 (20 of 1967) 
The Committee feels that sections 4 to 32 amending the Income-tax Act, 1961, section 
34 amending the Wealth-tax Act, 1957, section 35 amending the Gift-tax Act, 1958 (proposed 
to be repealed under Sl. No. 161), section 36 amending the Companies (Profits) Surtax Act, 
1964, section 37 amending the Indian Tariff Act, 1934, section 40 amending the Central 
Excise and Salt Act, 1944 (short title as it stood before its amendment), section 43 amending 
the Indian Post Office Act, 1898 and section 44 amending the Deposit Insurance Corporation 
Act, 1961 (other than of being substantive provisions of the provisions being governed 
by the Finance Act) can be repealed. 
227. The Standards of Weights and Measures (Extension to Kohima and 
Mokokchung Districts) Act, 1967 (25 of 1967)

Measures Act, 1956 to the Kohima and Mokokchung districts in the State of Nagaland.

Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. The Law Commission, inter alio, 
observed that the aforesaid Act extended the Standards of Weights and Measures Act, 1956 to 
the Kohima and Mokochung districts in the State of Nagaland. The Standards of Weights and 
Measures Act, 1956 was repealed by the Standards of Weights and Measures Act, 1976. This 
law is redundant and serves no purpose. Hence, it should be repealed. 
Attention is drawn to section 57 of the Legal Metrology Act, 2009 (1 of 2010) which 
has repealed the Standards of Weights and Measures Act, 1976. The Legal Metrology Act, 
2009 extends to whole of India as provided under sub-section (2) of section 1 of that Act. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
228.The Finance Act, 1968 (19 of 1968) 
120 
The Committee feels that sections 4 to 29 amending the Income-tax Act, 1961, section 
32 amending the Wealth-tax Act, 1957, section 33 amending the Companies (Profits) Surtax

Act, 1968 (49 of 1968)

1952 as in force in the Cantonment of Nasirabad.

recommended for repeal of this Act and observed that this Act was enacted to repeal the Delhi

repealed. The Commission further stated that the purpose of this Act has been served. It also 
stated that the Rajasthan Rent Control Act, 2001 has now been enacted by the State 
Legislature which has repealed the Rajasthan Premises (Control of Rent and Eviction) Act,

The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the establishment in the States and 
Union territories of Agricultural Credit Corporations and for matters connected therewith or 
incidental thereto. 
The Department of Financial Services vide their D.O. letter No.9/15/2014-Coord dated 
12th September, 2014, at serial no. 36 of the Annexure-I to the aforesaid D.O. stated that the 
RBI and NABARD have since recommended repealing the aforesaid Act on the grounds that 
it has lost its relevance and no State Agricultural Credit Corporation has been established by 
any of the States since the enactment of the said Act. As per the opinion of RBI and the 
National Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), in terms of section 19 of 
the State Agricultural Credit Corporations Act, 1968, the mandate of the said Act was to 
provide loans and advances for a period not more than five years to agriculturists, 
cooperatives banks and primary agricultural credit societies (PACS). The administrative 
Ministry further stated that following its enactment in 1968, nationalization of banks took 
place in 1969 and commercial banks became major purveyors of agriculture credit. With the 
advent of technological innovations in banking, mandatory opening of rural branches by 
Commercial banks and special efforts taken by Government of India and banks for Financial 
Inclusion, and as a spin-off, majority of the agricultural population can approach institutional 
banking services and avail of banking facilities there from. In such a scenario, the State 
Agricultural Credit Corporations functioning, if any would duplicate the efforts taken by 
Governments and other institutions in the public and private sector. 
The administrative Ministry further stated that the authorized capital of the State 
Agricultural Financial Corporation is only Rs.5.00 crore and in the current context will be 
121 
inadequate for the Sector In terms of section 19 of the State Agricultural Credit Corporations 
Act, 1968, the mandate is to provide loans and advances for a period not more than five years 
to agriculturists, cooperatives banks and PACS. 
The administrative Ministry also stated that they have ascertained from RBI and 
NABARD that no Corporation has been established by any of the States since the enactment- 
of the said Act. The administrative Ministry stated that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
In view of the above, the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
231.The Finance Act, 1969 (14 of 1969) 
The Committee feels that sections 3 to 23 amending the Income-tax Act, 1961, section ' 
24 amending the Wealth-tax Act, 1957, section 25 amending the Companies (Profits) Surtax 
Act, 1964, section 26 amending the Indian Tariff Act, 1934, section 29 amending the Indian 
Tariff (Amendment) Act, 1949 and section 30 amending the Central Excises and Salt Act, 
1944 (short title as it stood before its amendment) [other than of being substantive 
provisions of the provisions being governed by the Finance Act] of the aforesaid Act can 
be repealed. 
232.The Companies (Amendment) Act, 1969 (17 of 1969) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to amend the Companies Act, 1956.

company were ceased to operate on and from the 3rd day of April, 1970, being the appointed 
day as mentioned in section 2 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1969. The Companies 
Act, 1956 has been repealed and re-enacted as the Companies Act, 201308 of 2013). The 
concerned Ministry may consider whether the saving clause provided under Companies Act, 
2013 would suffice. 
The Committee feels that the provisions served the purpose and the aforesaid Act 
can be repealed after making a specific saving clause, on the following lines, namely:— 
"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in section 4, the repeal 
of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1969, shall not affect the things done or omitted to be 
done by the managing agents and secretaries and treasurers before their cessation as such, as 
provided under section 6 of the aforesaid Act, before such repeal.".

Act, 1969 (23 of 1969) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to amend the Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and 
Development) Act, 1957. 
The aforesaid Act consists of three sections out of which section 2 has been repealed 
by the Repealing and Amending Act,1974 (56 of 1974). Section 3 provides for validation of 
certain acquisitions. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act served the purpose and may be 
repealed after the following specific saving in the Repealing Bill, 2014, namely:— 
"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in section 4, every 
acquisition of land or the rights in or over land made by the Central Government in pursuance 
of the notifications of the Government of India in the late Ministry of Steel, Mines and Fuel

Bearing Areas (Acquisition and Development) Amendment Act, 1969, were in force at all 
material times when such acquisition was made and shall not be called in question in any court 
of law on the grounds only that before issuing such notifications no notification was issued 
under section 7 of the Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and Development) Act, 1957 in 
relation to the land or rights in or over such land covered by the aforesaid notification Nos. 
S.O. 1759 and S.O. 25.". 
234.The Central Sales Tax (Amendment) Act, 1969 (28 of 1969)

commerce effected during the period between 10th November 1964 and 9th June 1969. The 
amendments made have by this Act have been effected in the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956. 
Hence, the purpose of this Act has been fulfilled and the Central Government should repeal 
this Act. A suitable savings clause should be inserted in the repealing Act. 
The aforesaid Act contains 11 sections, out of which sections 2 to 8 had been repealed 
by the Repealing and Amending Act, 1974 (56 of 1974). Section 9 contains provision for 
validation of assessments etc. Section 10 relates to exemption from liability to pay tax in 
certain cases and section 11 relates to repeal and saving of the Central Sales Tax 
(Amendment) Ordinance, 1969. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed after making a 
specific saving clause in the Repealing Bill, 2014, on the following lines, namely:— 
"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in section 4,- 
(a) notwithstanding anything contained in any judgment, decree or order of any 
court or other authority to the contrary, any assessment, re-assessment, levy or collection 
of any tax made or purporting to have been made, any action or thing taken or done in 
relation to such assessment, re-assessment, levy or collection under the provisions of the 
Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, before the 9th day of June, 1969, shall be deemed before 
and after repeal of the repeal of the Central Sales Tax (Amendment) Act, 1969, to be as 
valid and effective as if such assessment, re-assessment, levy or collection or action or 
thing had been made, taken or done under the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 as amended 
by the Central Sales Tax (Amendment) Act, 1969 as the said Act had not been repealed 
and accordingly — 
(i) all acts, proceedings or things done or taken by the Government or by any 
officer of the Government or by any other authority in connection with the 
assessment, re-assessment, levy or collection of such tax shall, for all purposes, 
be deemed to be, and to have always been, done or taken in accordance with law; 
123 
(ii) no suit or other proceedings shall be maintained or continued in any court or 
before any authority for the refund of any such tax; and 
(iii) no court shall enforce any decree or order directing the re-fund of any such 
tax; 
(iv) nothing in sub-section (1) shall be construed as preventing any person — 
(A) from questioning in accordance with the provisions of the Central 
Sales Tax Act, 1956, as amended by the Central Sales Tax (Amendment) 
Act, 1969 before such repeal, any assessment, re-assessment, levy or 
collection of tax referred to in sub-section (1), or 
(B) from claiming refund of any tax paid by him in excess or the amount 
due from him by way of tax under the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, as a 
amended by the Central Sales Tax (Amendment) Act, 1969 before such 
repeal; 
(b) where any sale of goods in the course of inter-Statc trade or commerce had 
been effected during the period between the 10th  day of November, 1964 and the 9th 
day of June, 1969, and the dealer effecting such sale has not collected any tax under 
the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, on the ground that no such tax could have been 
levied or collected in respect of such sale or any portion of the turnover relating to 
such sale and no such tax could have been levied or collected if the amendments . 
made in the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, by the Central Sales Tax (Amendment) Act, 
1969 before such repeal, had not been made, then, notwithstanding anything 
contained in clause (a) above, or the amendments made by that Act, the dealer shall 
not be liable to pay any tax under the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, as amended by the 
Central Sales Tax (Amendment) Act, 1969 before such repeal, in respect of such sale 
or such part of the turnover relating to such sale; 
(c) for the purposes of clause (b) above, the burden of proving that no tax was 
collected under the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, in respect of any sale referred to in 
clause (b) or in respect of any portion of the turnover relating to such sale shall be on 
the dealer effecting such sale; 
(d) in case any matter covered by section 9 and section 10 of the Central Sales 
Tax (Amendment) Act, 1969 arises after repeal of such Act, such matter shall be 
dealt with as if the aforesaid Act had not been repealed .". 
235.The Wakf (Amendment) Act, 1969 (38 of 1969) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to amend the Wakf Act, 1954. 
The Wakf (Amendment) Act, 1969 contains 11 sections out of which section 2 to 9 
had been repealed by the Repealing and Amending Act, 1974 (56 of 1974). Subsequently, the 
Wakf Act, 1954 and Wakf (Amendment) Act, 1984 had been repealed by section 112 of the 
Wakf Act, 1995 (43 of 1995). 
However, sections I, 10 and 11 of the Wakf (Amendment) Act, 1969 are still 
surviving. Section 10 contains provisions for making special provisions as to certain list of 
wakfs published under sub-section (2) of section 5 of the Wakf Act, 1954 and section 11 
contains provisions for validation of contribution paid or realized under section 46 of the 
Wakf Act, 1954. However, with the repeal of the Act of 1954, the Committee feels that 
nothing survives in this Act. The administrative Ministry may consider whether any saving 
provisions are required in respect of aforesaid sections 10 and 11 in view of the enactment of 
Wakf Act, 1995. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed after making a 
124 
specific saving clause in the Repealing Bill, 2014, on the following lines, namely:— 
"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in section 4,- 
(a) notwithstanding anything contained in the judgment, decree or order of any 
court to the contrary, and subject to the provisions of the second proviso to sub-
section (1) of section 6 of the Wakf Act, 1954, as amended by the Wakf 
(Amendment) Act, 1969,(as they stood before their repeal by the Wakf Act, 1995) 
every list of wakfs purporting to be a list of wakfs existing at the date of the 
commencement of the Wakf Act, 1954 in any part of a State and published or 
purporting to have been published under sub-section (2) of section 5 of the Wakf 
Act, 1954, before the 2nd December, 1969 [being the date of the commencement 
of the Wakf (Amendment) Act, 1969], shall be deemed to be, and shall be deemed 
always to have been, published in accordance with law unless being contrary 
provided for under the provisions of the Wakf Act, 1954; 
(b) notwithstanding anything contained in any law or any judgment, decree or 
order of any court, all contributions paid or realised, or purporting to have been 
paid or realised, under section 46 of the Wakf Act, 1954, (as it stood before its 
repeal by the Wakf Act, 1995), which would have been validly paid or realised if 
the amendments made to that Act by theWakf (Amendment) Act, 1969, were in 
force on the date of such payment or realisation, shall, for all purposes, be deemed 
to be, and shall be deemed always to have been, paid or realised in accordance 
with law before and after such repeal, and accordingly- 
(i) no suit or other legal proceeding shall be maintained or continued in any 
court after such repeal for the refund of the whole or any part of the contribution 
so paid or realised; and 
(ii) no court shall enforce after such repeal any decree or order directing the 
refund of the whole or any part of the contribution so paid or realised.". 
236.The International Monetary Fund and Bank (Amendment) Act, 1969 
(41 of 1969) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted further to amend the International Monetary Fund 
and Bank Act, 1945. 
The aforesaid Act contains only three sections which have come into force w.e.f 
26.12.1981 (Notification No.S.O.6, dated 19.12.1981). It does not contain any saving, 
validation or transitional provision. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
237. The Punjab Legislative Council (Abolition) Act, 1969 (46 of 1969) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the abolition of the Legislative 
Council of the State of Punjab and for matters supplemental, incidental and consequential 
thereto. 
The aforesaid Act contains nine sections. Section 1 relates to short title and 
commencement, section 2 relates to certain definitions used in the Act, section 3 relates to 
abolition of the Council, section 4 relates to amendment of article 168 of the Constitution, 
section 5 relates to amendment of Third and Fourth Schedules in the Representation of the

(Punjab) Order, 1951, section 7 relates to provisions as to the pending Bills, section 8 relates 
to power to adapt laws and section 9 relates to power to construe laws. 
The aforesaid Act has served its purpose and has become redundant. 
In the past, a similar Act namely, the West Bengal Legislative Council (Abolition) Act, 
1969 (20 of 1969) was repealed by the Two Member Constituencies (Abolition) and other 
Laws Repeal Act, 2001 (47 of 2001). The West Bengal Legislative Council (Abolition) Act, 
125 
1969(which had been repealed earlier) contained broadly the similar provisions i.e., Section 1 
relates to short title and commencement, section 2 relates to certain definitions used in the 
Act, section 3 relates to abolition of the Council, section 4 relates to amendment of article 168 
of the Constitution, section 5 relates to amendment of Third and Fourth Schedules in the 
Representation of the People Act, 1950, section 6 relates to repeal of the Delimitation of

pending Bills, section 8 relates to power to adapt laws and section 9 relates to power to 
construe laws on the lines of the provisions of the Punjab Legislative Council (Abolition) Act, 
1969 proposed to be repealed by the Committee. 
In view of the above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed.

to be repealed under Sl. No. 161 above), section 28 amending the Indian Tariff Act, 1934,

amending the Indian Post Office Act, 1898, and section 38 amending the Unit Trust of India 
Act, 1963 (other than of being substantive provisions of the provisions being governed by 
the Finance Act) can be repealed. 
239.The Petroleum (Amendment) Act, 1970 (24 of 1970) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to amend the Petroleum Act, 1934 and came into 
force with effect from the first day of August, 1970 [Notification No. S.0.494 (E), dated 
30.06.1976]. As per records available with the Committee by the Legislative Department, no 
reference was found as to whether this amendment Act has been repealed. All the provisions 
of the aforesaid Act have come into force and the aforesaid Act does not contain any 
substantive, validating or transitional provisions. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
240.The Merchant Shipping (Amendment) Act, 1970 (25 of 1970) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted further to amend the Indian Merchant Shipping 
Act, 1958 (44 of 1958).

as to whether the remaining section 1, section 17 and section 20 of the aforesaid Act has been 
repealed. Section 1 relates to short title and commencement and section 17 relates to insertion 
of new Part XIA in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958. Section 17 has come into force vide 
notification number S.O. 1187 dated 3.4.1974. Section 20 relates to certain contraventions 
etc. not to be offences. Section 20 has come into force vide notification number S.O. 3997 
dated 9.12.1970. 
The Committee feels that after the Merchant Shipping (Amendment) Act, 1970 
can be repealed after making a specific saving clause in respect of section 20 of the 
aforesaid Act, on the following lines, namely:— 
"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in section 4, the repeal of the 
Merchant Shipping (Amendment) Act, 1970 and notwithstanding the retrospective operation 
of sections 2 to 14 (both inclusive) of the aforesaid Act, no contravention of, or no failure to 
comply with, any of the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958, as amended by the 
aforesaid sections, shall render any person guilty of any offence if such contravention or 
failure-

the aforesaid sections, or to any existing provision thereof, as amended by any of the

Sub-section (2) of section 1 provides that sections 2 to 38 and sections 53 and 54 shall 
be deemed to have come into force on the lst day of April, 1971. 
The Committee feels that the provisions of the Finance (No.2) Act, 1971 amending 
the Income-tax, 1961, the Wealth Tax, 1957, the Gift-tax Act, 1958 (proposed to be repealed 
at SI. No. 161 above), the Companies (Profits) Surtax Act, 1964, the Indian Tariff Act, 1934, 
the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944 (short title as it stood before its amendment), the Indian

section 39 of the Finance (No.2) Act, 1971 (32 of 1971) amending the Indian 
Tariff Act, 1934 can be repealed;

Proceedings) Act, 1971 (20 of 1971). 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to validate appointments of certain officers under 
the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941, as in force in the Union territory of Delhi and to 
validate proceedings taken by such officers under that Act and the Central Sales Tax Act,

at SI. No. 149 of Appendix-Al (166 Central Acts recommended for repeal). 
127 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at SI. No. 50 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission, inter alia, observed

under the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941 as in force in the Union territory of Delhi and 
to validate proceedings taken by such officers under that Act and the Central Sales Tax Act, 
1956. Section 73 of the Delhi Sales Tax Act, 1975 repealed the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) 
Act, 1941 in its application to Delhi. Hence, this Act is now redundant and the Central 
Government should repeal this Act. A suitable savings clause should be inserted into the 
repealing Act. 
The Committee feels that aforesaid Act can be repealed after incorporating the 
specific saving clause (in addition to general saving clause) in respect of section 3 of the 
aforesaid Act on the following lines in the Repealing Bill, 2014, namely:- 
"Without prejudice to the generality of provisions contained in section 4, the repeal of

1971, by this Act, shall not affect— 
(a) appointment of any person made under or for the purposes of the Bengal Finance

have been made and jurisdiction exercised, orders made and all other acts or 
proceedings or things done or taken by the administrator or any person who's

of the Government or by any Tribunal or any other authority under the Bengal 
Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941, as in force in the Union territory of Delhi and in 
respect of which the validation provision had been made by clause (b) of section 3

any authority whatsoever on the ground that any such appointment was illegal or 
invalid or any such jurisdiction or order or other act proceeding or thing was not

1 relating to short title and section 8 relating to validation of certain acquisitions have not been 
repealed and are existing. Section 8 of the aforesaid Act relates to validation of certain 
acquisitions. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed after incorporating 
specific saving clause (in addition to general saving clause) on the following lines in the 
Repealing Bill, 2014, namely:- 
128 
"Without prejudice to the generality of provisions contained in section 4, the repeal of 
the Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and Development) Amendment and Validation Act, 
1971, shall not affect the validation provision made by section 8 of that Act to validate the 
acquisition of land, rights in or over land, order made, agreement entered into, or notification 
published or reports made, making of declarations and compensation or other mattes or things 
under the Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and Development) Act, 1957 in respect of which 
the validation provision had been made by section 8 of the Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition 
and Development) Amendment and Validation Act, 1971,as it stood before such repeal, and 
any matter (including the acquisition of land, rights in or over land, order made, agreement 
entered into, or notification published or reports made, making of declarations and 
compensation) under the Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and Development) Act, 1957,in 
respect of which validation had been made by section 8 of the Coal Bearing Areas

(Repeal) Act, 1971 (68 of 1971)

23rd December, 1971 being the date of assent of the President to that Act as no 
commencement clause is provided in the aforesaid Act. 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at SI. No. 51 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. The Law Commission, inter alia, 
observed that the aforesaid Act was enacted for the repeal of the Uttar Pradesh Cantonments 
(Control of Rent and Eviction) Act, 1952. The purpose of this Act has now been served and 
the Central Government should repeal this Act. 
The aforesaid Act contains only 3 sections. 
(i) Section 1 of the said Act relates to short title of the Act. 
(ii) section 2 of the said Act provides for the repeal of the Uttar Pradesh Cantonments 
(Control of Rent and Eviction) Act, 1952 from the date on which the United Provinces 
(Temporary) Control of Rent and Eviction Act, 1947 is extended by notification under section

issued on the 3rd April, 1972 vide S.R.O.8-E dated the 3rd April, 1972 published in the 
Gazette of India, Extraordinary, Part II, Section 4. Thus the Uttar Pradesh Cantonments

view of this the provisions of section 2 does not survive. 
Section 3 of the aforesaid Act contains provisions for saving of certain matters. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed after incorporating 
specific saving clause (in addition to general saving clause) on the following lines in the 
Repealing Bill, 2014, namely:- 
"Without prejudice to the generality of provisions contained in section 4, the repeal of 
Uttar Pradesh Cantonments (Control of Rent and Eviction) (Repeal) Act, 1971 shall not affect

(37 of 1974) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to provide, in the interests of national economic 
development, for the compulsory deposit of additional emoluments and for the framing of a 
scheme in relation thereto and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. 
The aforesaid Act came into force on the 6th day of July, 1974 as provided in sub- 
section (3) of section 1 of the aforesaid Act. 
The Law Commission in its One hundred and Fifty-ninth Report (1998) had

The Law Commission of India in its 250111  Report at Sl. No. 57 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission, inter alia, observed 
that the aforesaid Act The Act provided for, in the interest of national economic development, 
for the compulsory deposit of additional emoluments and for the framing of a scheme in 
relation thereto. The Act provided for the compulsory deposit by all persons into two separate 
accounts — the additional wages deposit account and the additional dearness allowance deposit 
account. The Law Commission of India in its 159th Report on Repeal and Amendment of 
Laws has documented the Department of Economic Affairs' proposal to repeal this Act. The . 
reason furnished by the Department of Economic Affairs for proposing repeal of this Act was 
that in future any occasion or necessity for such compulsory deposits will not arise. Hence, the 
Department proposed repeal of this Act while making provision for disposal of the amounts 
already in deposit under the respective enactments. As a result, the Central Government 
should repeal this Act. A suitable savings clause should be inserted in the repealing Act. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act may be repealed and such repeal has been 
included in the draft Bill appended hereto. The administrative Ministry may not move separate 
proposal to repeal the aforesaid Act as the repeal of the aforesaid Act has been included in the 
Repealing Bill, 2014. Suitable saving clause may be incorporated in the Repealing Bill, 2014. 
in consultation with the concerned Ministry.

any such officer by reason of any omission in this behalf to lay such regulation before Parliament 
and every such regulation shall for all purposes be deemed to have been duly laid before Parliament 
and shall have effect and shall be deemed always to have had effect accordingly.". 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid section was enacted for granting the 
132 
indemnity in respect of failure to lay before the Parliament certain regulations made 
before the commencement of the aforesaid Act and therefore, the same can be repealed 
by making a saving clause there for on the following lines, namely:—

the All-India Services Regulations (Indemnity) Act, 1975, shall not affect the indemnity 
granted to the Central Government and all Officers responsible for laying regulations as 
provided under section 2 of the All-India Services Regulations (Indemnity) Act, 1975, as it

Salt Act, 1944 (short title as it stood before its amendment) and the Central Sales Tax Act,

Finance Act) can be repealed. 
The committee feels that - 
(a) sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24 
[sections 3 to 24] of the Finance Act, 1975 (25 of 1975) amending the Income-tax Act, 1961

252. The Parliamentary Proceedings (Protection of Publication) 
Repeal Act, 1976 (28 of 1976). 
The Parliamentary Proceedings (Protection of Publication) Repeal Act, 1976 (aforesaid 
Act) has been enacted to repeal the Parliamentary Proceedings (Protection of Publication) Act, 
1956. The Parliamentary Proceedings (Protection of Publication) Repeal Act, 1976 came into 
force retrospectively from 8th December, 1975. 
The aforesaid Act consists of three sections, out of which, section 3 has been repealed 
by Act No. 19 of 1988. Section 2 of the aforesaid Act contains provisions for repeal of the 
Parliamentary Proceedings (Protection of Publication) Act, 1956. 
The proviso to aforesaid section 2 contains saving provision in respect of certain 
matters (including the publication, report or matter broadcast) under the 	
Parliamentary 
Proceedings (Protection of Publication) Act, 1956 after its repeal by the aforesaid Act. It 
provides that repeal of the Parliamentary Proceedings (Protection of Publication) Act, 1956 
shall not affect any proceedings, civil or criminal (whether pending immediately before the 
133 
commencement of the Parliamentary Proceedings (Protection of Publication) Repeal Act, 
1976 or instituted or taken after such commencement) in respect of (a) any publication 
referred to in sub-section (1) of section 3 of the said Act made before such commencement, or 
(b) any report or matter broadcast before such commencement, by means referred to in section 
4 of the said Act, and accordingly any such proceedings shall be disposed of as if the said Act 
had continued in force and this Act had not been passed. 
The aforesaid Act, does contain any saving provisions in respect of the Parliamentary 
Proceedings (Protection of Publication) Act, 1956 repealed by the aforesaid Act. The 
Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed as per legislative practice to clean the 
Statutes Book. In the past, the Criminal Tribes Laws (Repeal) Act, 1952 (24 of 1952), has 
been repealed by the Repealing and Amending Act, 1957 (36 of 1957), the Press Council 
(Repeal) Act, 1976 (24 of 1976) has been repealed by Repealing and Amending Act, 1988 (19 
of 1980) and the Gold Control (Repeal) Act, 1990 (18 of 1990) has been repealed by the 
Repealing and Amending Act, 2001 (30 of 2001). 
The Committee therefore feels that the aforesaid section was for continuation of 
the proceedings (Civil or Criminal) under the Parliamentary Proceedings (Protection of 
Publication) Act, 1956 as it stood before its repeal by the aforesaid Act. The same can be 
repealed by making a saving clause on the following lines, namely:- 
"Without prejudice to the generality of provisions contained in section 4, the repeal of 
the Parliamentary Proceedings (Protection of Publication) Repeal Act, 1976, shall not affect 
any proceedings, civil or criminal [pending immediately before the commencement of the 
Parliamentary Proceedings (Protection of Publication) Repeal Act, 1976], saved under section 
2 of the Parliamentary Proceedings (Protection of Publication) Repeal Act, 1976, before its 
repeal, and the aforesaid section 2 shall, in respect of such proceedings, civil or criminal, if 
any, pending after the commencement of this Act, be construed, as if the aforesaid Act had 
not been repealed.". 
253. The Finance Act, 1976 (66 of 1976). 
Sub-section (2) of section 1 provides that sections 2 to 30 and section 43 shall be 
deemed to have come into force on the 1s` day of April, 1976. 
The Committee feels that the provisions of the Finance Act, 1975, amending the 
Income-tax, 1961, the Wealth Tax, 1957, the Gift-tax Act, 1958 (proposed to be repealed at 
SI. No. 161 above), the Companies (Profits) Surtax Act, 1964, the Interest-tax Act, 1974, the 
Indian Tariff Act, 1934, the Indian Tariff (Amendment) Act, 1949, the Central Excises and

Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956, the Unit Trust of India Act, 1963 and the Compulsory 
Deposit Scheme (Income-tax Payers) Act, 1974 (other than of being substantive provisions 
or provisions being governed by the Finance Act) can be repealed. 
The committee feels that- 
(a) sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 and 
26 [sections 3 to 26] of the Finance Act, 1976 (66 of 1976) amending the Income-tax Act, 
1961 can be repealed; 
(b) section 27 of the Finance Act, 1976 (66 of 1976) amending the Wealth Tax, 1957 (27 of 
1967) can be repealed; 
(c) section 28 of the Finance Act, 1976 (66 of 1976) amending the Gift-tax Act, 1958 
(proposed to be repealed at Sl.No. 161 above) can be repealed;

1963 can be repealed; 
(1) section 43 of the Finance Act, 1976 (66 of 1976) amending the Compulsory Deposit 
Scheme (Income-tax Payers) Act, 1974 can be repealed. 
254. The National Library of India Act, 1976 (76 of 1976) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted for the administration of the National Library and 
other connected matters. The expression "Library" means the institution located at Kolkata 
and known at the commencement of the Constitution as a "National Library". 
The Ministry of Culture vide its I.D. Note No.21-115/2014-CDN, dated 29th 
September, 2014 stated that the Joint Committee of the Parliament felt that the authority as 
proposed in the aforesaid Act will not be conducive to the efficient functioning of the library. 
Keeping this in view and the position to the Act from various quarters when the Act was 
formulated, the National Library of India Act, 1976 may not be brought into force and the 
library may continue to function as a subordinate office under the Department of Culture and 
Dr Pratap Chandra, the Minister of Education mentioned that the aforesaid Act was come into 
force from the date it was notified in the Gazette. They also stated that the Government has 
not so far brought this Act into force and National Library continues to be a subordinate office 
of the Department of Culture. 
The Ministry of Culture in the aforesaid I.D. Note has conveyed that the Act may be 
allowed as pre-existing status. 
The Committee feels that even after expiry of 38 years the aforesaid Act has not been 
into force. The concerned Ministry has not indicated any reasons or grounds or justification 
for keeping the aforesaid Act in the Statutes Book before bringing it into force against the 
recommendation of the Joint Committee of Parliament. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that an Act in the Statutes Book which has 
not brought into force for the 38 years can be repealed. 
255. The Delhi Sales Tax (Amendment and Validation) Act, 1976 
(91 of 1976). 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to amend retrospectively the law relating to sales 
tax as in force in the Union territory of Delhi during a past period and to validate taxes on the 
sale of purchase of certain goods during such period. 
The Delhi Sales Tax Act, 1975 has been enacted in the year 1975 and sub-section (1) 
of section 73 of the said Act repealed the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941 extended and 
as in force in Delhi. The Delhi Sales Tax (Amendment and Validation) Act, 1976 has 
validated the sales tax extension notifications issued under the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) 
Act, 1941as in force in Delhi and also validated the actions taken under those notifications. 
Section 1 of the Delhi Sales Tax (Amendment and Validation) Act, 1976 relates to 
135 
short title and section 2 relates to definitions of certain expressions used in the Act and section 
3 provides for validation of the notifications issued (prior to the enactment of the Delhi Sales 
Tax Act, 1975) under the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941as in force in Delhi and 
validates the action thereon. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid section 3 was for extension notifications 
issued (prior to the enactment of the Delhi Sales Tax Act, 1975) under the Bengal 
Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941 as in force in Delhi and validates the action taken thereon 
and the Delhi Sales Tax (Amendment and Validation) Act, 1976 can be repealed by 
making a saving clause there for on the following lines, namely:— 
"Without prejudice to the generality of provisions contained in section 4, the repeal of the 
Delhi Sales Tax (Amendment and Validation) Act, 1976, shall not affect— 
(a) the validity of the sales tax extension notifications referred to in sub-section (1) of 
section 3 of the aforesaid Act, as it stood before its repeal; 
(b) the validity of the powers of the Central Government to issue notification under sub- 
section (2) of section 6 of the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941, as in force in Delhi, to 
add to or omit from or otherwise amend the Schedule (including the levy, assessment and 
collection of tax) referred to in sub-section (2) of section 3 of the aforesaid Act, as it stood 
before its repeal; 
(c) the validity of the notifications, notwithstanding any judgement, decree or order of any 
Court or any authority, referred to in sub-section (3) of section 3 of the aforesaid Act, as it 
stood before its repeal and accordingly- 
(i) any tax levied, assessed or collected or purporting to have been levied, assessed or 
collected as referred to in clause (a) of sub-section (3) of section 3 of the aforesaid Act, 
shall always be deemed to have been validly levied, assessed or collected as provided 
in the aforesaid clause (a); 
(ii) no suit or other proceeding maintained or continued in any court or before any 
authority for the refund of, and no enforcement shall be made by any court or other 
authority of any decree or order directing the refund of, any such tax which has been 
collected, as provided in clause (b) of sub-section (3) of section 3 of the aforesaid Act; 
(iii) recoveries made or to be made, in accordance with the proviso to sub-section (1) 
of section 73 of the Delhi Sales Tax Act, 1975, of all amounts which would have been 
collected as tax under the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941, as in force in Delhi, 
by reason of any amendment referred to in sub-clause (i) but which had not been 
collected, as provided in clause (c) of sub-section (3) of section 3 of the aforesaid Act; 
(iv) no act or omission on the part of any person shall be punishable as an offence 
which would not have been so punishable if section 3 of the Delhi Sales Tax 
(Amendment and Validation) Act, 1976, had not come into force, as provided in sub-
section (4) of section 3 of the aforesaid Act before such repeal, 
and in case any matter, issue or thing (including levy of tax, assessment or conferment of 
power upon the Central Government or validity of issue of notifications or commission of an 
offence) arises after such repeal, such matter, issue or thing shall be decided in accordance 
with the provisions of aforesaid section 3 as the Delhi Sales Tax (Amendment and Validation) 
Act, 1976 had not been repealed.". 
256. The Untouchability (Offences) Amendment 
and Miscellaneous Provision Act, 1976 (106 of 1976). 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to amend the Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955 
and further to amend the Representation of the People Act, 1951. 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at Sl. No. 60 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. The Law Commission, inter alia, 
136 
observed that the aforesaid Act amends the Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955 and also, the 
Representation of the People Act, 1951. Corresponding amendments have been carried out in 
both the enactments. Hence, the purpose of this Act has been fulfilled and the Central 
Government should repeal this Act. The Act also saves the effect of the previous operation of 
the Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955. However, since a considerable number of years of 
elapsed since the enactment of the Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955 as well as this 
Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, it is safe to assume that no right, privilege, 
obligation or liability under the Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955 as originally named still 
persists. Hence, the Central Government should repeal this Act. 
By the aforesaid amendment, the title of the Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955 has 
been changed to "the Protection of Civil Rights Act" and certain amendments have been 
carried out in the principal Act. 
The aforesaid Act contains 21 sections. Except sections 1, 19 and 20 of the aforesaid 
Act, all other sections have been repealed by Act No. 19 of 1988. Section 1 of the Act relates 
to short title, section 19 of the Act relates to reference of the title of the Act and section 20 
relates to savings of the actions taken under the Act with prior title of the aforesaid Act. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Untouchability (Offences) Amendment 
and Miscellaneous Provision Act, 1976 can be repealed by making a saving clause on the 
following lines, namely:— 
"Without prejudice to the generality of provisions contained in section 4,- 
(i) any reference to the Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955 in any Act, rule, notification or 
order shall, notwithstanding the repeal of the Untouchability (Offences) Amendment and 
Miscellaneous Provision Act, 1976 by this Act, on or after the 19th November, 1976 
(being the date on which the Untouchability (Offences) Amendment and Miscellaneous 
Provision Act, 1976 came into force) be, after such repeal, construed as the Protection of 
Civil Rights Act, 1955; 
(ii) alteration of the short title of the Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955 as the Protection 
of Civil Rights Act, 1955 by the Untouchability (Offences) Amendment and Miscellaneous 
Provision Act, 1976 shall not, after the repeal of the Untouchability (Offences) Amendment 
and Miscellaneous Provision Act, 1976, - 
(a) affect the previous operation of the Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955, or anything

291.The Levy Sugar Price Equalisation Fund (Amendment) Act, 1984 
(54 of 1984). 
The aforesaid Act contains eight sections out of which sections 2 to 7 had been 
repealed by Act 19 of 1988. Section 1 relates to short title and section 8 relates to validation. 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at Sl. No. 76 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. 'Ihe Law Commission observed that 
the Act provides for the establishment, in the interest of the general public, of a fund to ensure 
that the price of levy sugar may be uniform throughout India. 'Levy sugar' is the 10% of sugar 
output that every sugar manufacturer has to sell to the government at reduced rates for the 
Public Distribution System (PDS). In view of the ongoing process of deregulating sugar, the 
Union Cabinet in 2013 approved the removal of levy sugar, initially for a period of 2 years. 
The need for this Act is therefore being done away with. Hence, the Central Government 
should repeal this Act after introducing a suitable savings clause. This Act has been 
recommended for repeal by the Planning Commission in its letter No. 25/04/2014-OM&C 
dated 18th September 2014 to the Member Secretary, Law Commission of India. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No.79 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that the Government has moved towards doing away with the 
system of levy sugar. In 2013, the Union Cabinet approved the removal of levy sugar, first for 
a period of two years, with a view to making the removal permanent. As a result, the aforesaid 
Act is no longer necessary. The deregulation of the sugar industry has been a longstanding 
demand. The system of levy sugar has cost the sugar industry an additional Rs. 3,000 crores a 
year, which is why the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) has been demanding its 
abolition. Acts like this one are remnants of the controls regime that should therefore be done 
away with. This Act has resulted in a great deal of burdensome and unnecessary litigation. 
The Department of Food and Public Distribution reported in 2012 that Rs. 26 crores in dues 
from 53 manufacturers was caught up in litigation. In some cases, dues are pending from the 
1970s while in other cases, appeals have gone right up to the Supreme Court. It further states. 
150 
that the aforesaid Act is mentioned at Si. No. 131 in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. 
However, this does not affect the power of Parliament to repeal the Act. Pending litigation 
under the Act will remain unaffected by the repeal if a standard saving clause is added to the 
repealing provisions. A saving clause prevents the repeal from affecting any litigation that 
continues under the Act being repealed, and is usually worded as 'the repeal shall not affect 
any legal proceeding continued under the Act'. 
Attention is invited to article 31B of the Constitution, which reads as under:— 
[Validation of certain Acts and Regulations. 
31B. Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in article 31A, none of the Acts 
and Regulations spccified in the Ninth Schedule nor any of the provisions thereof shall be deemed to 
be void, or ever to have become void, on the ground that such Act, Regulation or provision is 
inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by, any provisions of this 
Part, and notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any court or Tribunal to the contrary, each of 
the said Acts and Regulations shall, subject to the power of any competent Legislature to repeal or 
amend it, continue in force.] 
The Committee feels that Parliament has legislative competence to repeal the 
aforesaid Act and therefore, it can be repealed after making following specific saving 
clause (in addition to general saving clause) on the following lines in the Repealing Bill, 
2014, namely:- 
"Without prejudice to the generality of provisions contained in section 4, the repeal of the 
Levy Sugar Price Equalisation Fund (Amendment) Act, 1984 shall, notwithstanding any 
judgment, decree or order of any court, tribunal or other authority, anything or action done or 
taken or purporting to have been done or taken under the provisions of the Levy Sugar Price 
Equalisation Fund Act, 1976 before the 23rd August, 1984 being the date of commencement 
of the Levy Sugar Price Equalisation Fund (Amendment) Act, 1984 shall, for all purposes, be 
deemed to be, and to have always been, as validly and effectively done or taken as if the 
amendments made to the Levy Sugar Price Equalisation Fund Act, 1976 , by section 2, clause 
(e) of section 3, section 5 and section 6 of the Levy Sugar Price Equalisation Fund 
(Amendment) Act, 1984, had been in force at all material times and no act or omission on the 
part of any person shall be punishable as an offence which would not have been so punishable 
if the aforesaid provisions of section 2, clause (e) of section 3, section 5, section 6 and section 
5 of the Levy Sugar Price Equalisation Fund (Amendment) Act, 1984 had not come into force 
and such thing or action done or taken or purporting to have been done or taken shall be

all the Validation Acts can be repealed after providing saving clauses wherever necessary. 
The validation Act has been repealed earlier also. [Refer the Manipur Court-Fees

PART II 
CENTRAL ACTS IDENTIFIED FOR REPEAL IN CONSULTATION 
WITH THE CONCERNED MINISTRY/DEPARTMENT 
656. The Excise (Spirits) Act, 1863 (XVI of 1863). 
The aforesaid Act provides to make special provision for the levy of Excise Duty 
payable on Spirits used exclusively in Arts and Manufactures or in Chemistry and penal 
provisions. The aforesaid Act was enacted by the Legislative Council of India and received 
the assent of the Governor General on the 10th March, 1863. 
Attention is invited to Entry 8 of List-II (State List) to the Seventh Schedule to the 
Constitution, which reads as under:— 
"8.intoxicating liquors, that is to say, the production, manufacture, possession, transport, purchase and 
sale of intoxicating liquors.". 
Attention is also invited to Entry 51 of List-II (State List) to the Seventh Schedule to 
the Constitution, which reads as under:— 
"Duties of excise on the following goods manufactures or produced in the State and countervailing 
duties at the same or lower rates on similar goods manufactures or produced elsewhere in India:— 
(a) alcoholic liquors for human consumption; 
(b) opium, Indian hemp and other narcotic drugs and narcotics, 
but not including medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol or any substance included in sub- 
paragraph (b) of this entry.". 
Attention is invited to Entry 84 of List-I (Union List) to the Seventh Schedule to the 
Constitution, which reads as under:— 
'Duties of excise on tobacco and other goods manufactured or produced in India except— 
(a) alcoholic liquors for human consumption; 
(b) opium, Indian hemp and other narcotic drugs and narcotics, 
but including medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol or any substance included in sub-
paragraph (b) of this entry.". 
At present, as per knowledge acquired through the perusal of the Central Acts, the 
Excise Duty on the spirit is regulated by the Central Excise Act, 1944 and the Central Excise 
Tariff Act, 1985 as amended from time to time. In view of the aforesaid enactments and by 
efflux of time, the aforesaid Act has become redundant in its application. The aforesaid Acts 
needs to be repealed after consultation with the administrative Ministry. 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at Sl. No. 28 under Chapter 2 of 
the Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. The Law Commission 
observed that the aforesaid Act provided for the levy of excise duty payable on spirits used 
exclusively in 'arts and manufactures or in chemistry'. This now falls under the category of 
excise on industrial alcohol which is levied by the Central Government under the Central 
Excise Tariff Act, 1985. The 1863 Act is therefore redundant and should be repealed by the 
Central Government. 
The administrative Ministry vide their OM No. 296/146/2014-CX.9 dated the 1st 
October, 2014 have stated that since the levy of the Central Excise Duty on Spirit 
exclusively used in Arts and manufacture or in Chemistry is provided for under the First 
Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985, a separate enactment is not required. They 
further stated that under the State List (List II), Part XI of the Constitution of India, Duties 
of excise on alcoholic liquors for human consumption, manufactured or produced in the 
State are under the legislative competence of State Legislatures. Since the operation of this 
Act impacts the functioning of the State Excise Departments also their view may be taken 
before the repeal of the said Act. 
238 
The Central Excise Duty on Spirit exclusively used in Arts and manufacture or in 
Chemistry is provided for under the First Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 as 
stated by the administrative Ministry and recommendation of the Law Commission for 
repeal of the aforesaid Act, without referring to the consultation with the relevant States, the 
Committee feels that the concerned Department may re-visit their suggestion in the aforesaid 
O.M. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed in 
consultation with the concerned administrative Ministry. 
• 
657.The North-Western Provinces Village and Road Police Act, 1873 
(16 of 1873) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to consolidate and amend the law relating to 
Village and Road Police in the North-Western Provinces. 
The P.C. Jain Commission in its Report at Serial No. 72 of Appendix-A-5 (114 
Central Acts for repeal by the State Government) had recommended for repeal of the 
aforesaid Act. 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at SI. No. 32 under Chapter 2 of 
the Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act in consultation with relevant 
State i.e., . Uttar Pradesh referring to the earlier recommendations of the P.C. Jain 
Commission. It has observed that the aforesaid Act was enacted to consolidate and amend 
the law relating to village and road police in the North-Western Provinces of the Presidency 
of Fort William in Bengal. The Act contains provisions for the appointment, and duties and 
liabilities of village and road policemen in the said provinces. The erstwhile North-Western 
Provinces now constitute the administrative unit of Agra, which is in the modern-day State 
of Uttar Pradesh. Although this Act was enacted by the Governor-General-in-Council pre-
independence, it is now administered by the relevant State, Uttar Pradesh, which also has the 
power to repeal or amend this law. Therefore, the Central Government should write to the 
State Government of Uttar Pradesh recommending the review of this law by the State, with a 
view to repeal. The Central Government should also remove this law from its lists of central 
Acts in force. 
The Ministry of Home Affairs vide its O.M. No.I-34020/122/2014-Coord.I dated 
19th September, 2014 has stated that the North-Eastern Provinces Village and Road Police 
Act, 1873 (Act 16 of 1873) [Error in the Jain Commission Report. Act 16 of 1873 is the 
North-Western Provinces Village and Road Police Act, 1873]. It further stated that the Act 
provides appointment of Village Police and Road police in north Western Provinces of the 
Presidency of Fort William in Bengal and this Act is no longer applicable in the North 
Eastern States and hence can be repealed in consultation with Ministry of Law and justice. 
In view of the above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed 
under this Chapter in consultation with the concerned administrative Ministry. 
658. The Madras Forest (Validation) Act, 1882 (XXI of 1882) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to remove doubts regarding the Madras Forest 
Act, 1882 to specify that no enactment of the Governor General in Council shall affect, or 
shall be deemed to have at any time contained anything which would affect, the Madras 
Forest Act, 1882. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for its repeal at SI. No.61 of 
Appendix A-5 (114 Central Acts recommended for repeal by State Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at SI. No. 40 under Chapter 2 of 
the Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act in consultation with State of 
239 
Tamil Nadu referring to the earlier recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. It has 
observed that the aforesaid Act was enacted to remove doubts regarding the Tamil Nadu 
Forest Act, also enacted in 1882. The purpose of this Act has been fulfilled. Since the 
subject-matter of forests falls in the Concurrent List (See, Entry 17A, List III, Seventh 
Schedule), the Central Government is competent to repeal this Act. Hence, the Central 
Government should repeal this Act after consultation with the State of Tamil Nadu, and after 
inserting a suitable savings clause. 
By efflux of time, the aforesaid Act has become obsolete in its application and needs 
to be repealed. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed after consultation 
with the stake holders. 
659. The Indian Medical Degrees Act, 1916. (VII of 1916) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to regulate the grant of titles implying 
qualifications in western medical science and the assumption and use by unqualified persons 
of such titles. 
The aforesaid Act has become redundant in view of the enactment of the Medical 
Council of India Act, 1956, which provide for the reconstitution of the medical council of 
India and the maintenance of a medical register for India and for matters connected 
therewith. The aforesaid Act lost its relevance and needs to be repealed. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed in consultation with 
the concerned administrative Ministry i.e., Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. 
660.The Trading with the Enemy (Continuance of Emergency Provisions) 
Act, 1947 (XVI of 1947) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the continuance of certain 
provisions of the Defence of India Rules relating to the control of trading with States, the 
persons and firms belonging to States at war with India, and the custody of the property 
belonging to them. 
The Defence of India Rules were made in pursuance of the Defence of India Act, 
1939 which has been repealed by Act No. 2 of 1948. However, the provisions of the said 
Rules were revived with the enactment of the Trading with the Enemy (Continuance of 
Emergency Provisions) Act, 1947. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No.23 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that the aforesaid Act is no longer in practical application: The 
objective of this legislation is now being fulfilled by the Enemy Property Act, 1968. The 
1968 Act, provides a mechanism for divesting of enemy property, i.e., property belonging to 
nationals and firms of hostile countries, in the Custodian of Enemy Property for India. The 
Act contains provisions related to the appointment of the Custodian and divesting and 
management of 'enemy property'. 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at Sl. No. 12 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission, inter alia, observed 
that the aforesaid Act provided for the continuation of certain provisions of the Defence of 
India Rules, 1939 relating to the control of trading with States, and persons and firms 
belonging to States at war with the Government of India, and the custody of the property 
belonging to them. The purpose of this Act has been subsumed by the Enemy Property Act, 
1968 which provides for the continuing of vesting of enemy property vested in the Custodian 
of Enemy Property for India under the Defence of India Rules, 1962 and the Defence on 
240 
India Rules, 1971. Hence, this Act is now redundant and the Central Government should 
repeal this Act. 
Though the principal Act i.e., the Defence of India Act, 1939 has been repealed by 
Act No. 2 of 1948 but the Trading with the Enemy (Continuance of Emergency Provisions) 
Act, 1947 reviving the rules made under the Defence of India Act, 1939 are still existing on 
the Statutes Book. 
The aforesaid rules revived by the Trading with the Enemy (Continuance of 
Emergency Provisions) Act, 1947 may not be relevant and become redundant as they relate 
to the pre-independence period. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed in consultation with 
the Ministries concerned. 
661. The Resettlement of Displaced Persons (Land Acquisition) Act, 1948 
(60 of 1948) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the speedy acquisition of land for 
the resettlement of displaced persons. 
The Centre for Civil Society at 51. No.29 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed inter alia stated that the aforesaid Act was enacted to provide relief to persons 
displaced from their place of residence (in areas now comprising of Pakistan) on account of 
the Partition, and subsequently residing in India. The beneficiaries of this law no longer exist 
as the law was specifically enacted to deal with the situation immediately post partition; 
hence the Act has outlived its utility. The repeal will not have any administrative 
repercussions. Unlike other resettlement/displacement legislations, the Act does not mention 
any intermediary holding company through which properties are allocated. It simply 
mentions a 'competent authority' as defined under section 2 (a) as the Collector or any other 
person appointed by the state on this behalf. Other laws, namely, (i) the Administration of 
Evacuee Property Act, 1950,(ii) the Displaced Persons (Claims) Act, 1950, (iii) the 
Evacuee Interest (Separation) Act, 1951, (iv) the Displaced Persons (Claims) 
Supplementary Act 1954 and (v) the Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) 
Act, 1954 relating to persons displaced from Pakistan during the Partition have been 
repealed by the Schedule to the Displaced Persons Claims and Other Laws Repeal Act, 
2005. 
Recently, the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, 
Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 has been enacted on the 27th September, 2013. 
Section 105 of this Act specifically mentions that the provisions of the Right to Fair 
Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 
2013 shall not apply or apply with certain modifications to the Resettlement of Displaced 
Persons (Land Acquisition) Act, 1948 specified at Sl. No.10 in the Fourth Schedule to the 
Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and 
Resettlement Act, 2013. 
Sub-section (1) of section 2 of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in 
Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 inter alia provides that 
provisions of the aforesaid Act shall apply for the public purposes and the purposes specified 
under clause (a) to (f) therein. Clause (f) of sub-section (1) of section 2 reads as under:— 
"(t) project for residential purposes to the poor or landless or to persons residing in areas affected by 
natural calamities, or to persons displaced or affected by reason of the implementation of any scheme 
undertaken by the Government, any local authority or a corporation owned or controlled by the State." . 
The "public purpose" for acquisition of land under the Right to Fair Compensation 
and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 under 
sub-section (1) of section 2 of that Act is vide enough to include the purposes of the 
Resettlement of Displaced Persons (Land Acquisition) Act, 1948 and clauses (a) to (f) of 
241 
sub-section (1) of section 2 of the aforesaid Act are is inclusive i.e., suggestive/illustrative 
and not specific or restrictive. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be considered for repeal after 
consultation with the concerned Ministry. 
662. The Prevention of Seditious Meetings Act, 1911 (X of 1911) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to consolidate and amend the law relating to the 
prevention of public meetings likely to promote sedition or to cause a disturbance of public 
tranquillity. 
The Law Commission in its 248th Report at SI. No. 39 under Chapter 4 had 
recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. The Law Commission observed that this Act 
empowered a District Magistrate or Commissioner of Police to prohibit a public meeting in a 
proclaimed area if they believe such meeting is likely to promote sedition. This Act was 
enacted with the express purpose of clamping down on meetings being held by nationalists. 
The Act prohibited meetings 'likely to cause disturbance or public excitement', but the 
specific provisions creating offences suffer from vagueness. Given that private meetings are 
also covered under this Act by virtue of section 3(2), its provisions are unduly harsh. The 
continuation of this colonial legislation is unnecessary given the extensive provisions 
relating to sedition under the Indian Penal Code. Further, the provisions of the Act are likely 
to be ultra vires Articles 19(1)(a) and (b). 
Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, reads as under:– 
"124A. Sedition —Whoever, by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible 
representation, or otherwise, brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or 
attempts to excite disaffection towards, the Government established by law in India, shall be 
punished with imprisonment for life, to which fine may be added, or with imprisonment 
which may extend to three years, to which fine may be added, or with fine. 
Explanation 1— The expression "disaffection" includes disloyalty and all feelings of 
enmity. 
Explanation 2— Comments expressing disapprobation of the measures of the Government 
with a view to obtain their alteration by lawful means, without exciting or attempting to 
excite hatred, contempt or disaffection, do not constitute an offence under this section. 
Explanation 3 — Comments expressing disapprobation of the administrative or other action 
of the Government without exciting or attempting to excite hatred, contempt or disaffection, 
do not constitute an offence under this section. 
CLASSIFICATION OF OFFENCE 
Punishment—Imprisonment for life and fine, or imprisonment for 3 years and fine, or fine- 
Cognizable—Non-bailable—Triable by Court of Session—Non compoundable. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act may have overlapping with section 
124A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The same may be examined and the aforesaid 
may be repealed, in consultation with the Ministry of Home Affairs, which is 
administering the aforesaid Act. 
663. The Weekly Holidays Act, 1942 (XVIII of 1942) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the grant of weekly holidays to 
persons employed in shops, restaurants and theatres. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No.60 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed inter alia stated that the aforesaid Act is repetitive with the Shop and Establishment 
Acts (of all States), which mandatorily prescribe a close day for all shops and 
242 
establishments. It also only applies to specific areas notified by state governments. For 
example in 2008, the coverage of the Act was particular to 7 areas in Karnataka (Murnad, 
Bhagamandala, Napoklu, Ammathi, Ponnampet and Hudikeri in Kudagu District and 
Munirabad and Kinnal in Raichur District) in the Port Blair Municipal Areas of Andaman 
and Nicobar Islands. In principle, India should aim to move towards a system of employment 
solely governed by mutual contracts signed by employers and employees. It further stated 
that notifications, if any, issued under the Weekly Holidays Act will have to be suitably 
modified to be made applicable under the Shops and Establishment Acts. In the alternative, 
fresh notification specifying close days may have to be issued under the Shops and 
Establishment Act, wherever applicable. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed in consultation with 
the administrative Ministry concerned. 
664. The Public Debt Act, 1944 (18 of 1944) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to consolidate and amend the law relating to 
Government securities and to the management by the Reserve bank of India of the public 
debt of the dominion and provinces. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has included the aforesaid Act at Serial No. 82 of 
Appendix-E (109 Acts under the list of Central Acts considered of Particular relevance to 
their terms of reference). Their recommendation is silent on the repeal of the aforesaid Act. 
The Department of Economic Affairs vide its O.M. No.11/47/2012-Ad.V dated 15 
September, 2014 stated that the Government Securities Act, 2006 has been enacted on 31st 
August, 2006 to replace the Public Debt Act, 1944. They further stated that the Public Debt 
Act, 1944 has not been repealed due some deposits under the Act with the RBI. Certificates 
under National Small Saving Funds are also being issued under the Act. 
The Government Securities Act, 2006 has been enacted to consolidate and amend the law 
relating to government securities and its management by the Reserve Bank of India and for 
matters connected therewith and incidental thereto and section 35 thereof repeals the Indian 
Securities Act, 1920 which was enacted to consolidate and amend the law relating to the 
Government Securities. Though the Government Securities Act, 2006 repeals the Indian 
Securities Act, 1920 yet it does not contain provisions for repeal of the Public Debt Act, 
1944. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the Public Debt Act, 1944 may be 
repealed and provisions relating to the National Small Saving Funds and appropriate 
saving clause for the some deposits under the Act with the RBI may be incorporated in 
the Government Securities Act, 2006 in consultation with the concerned Ministry. 
665.The Delhi Hotels (Control of Accommodation) Act, 1949 (24 of 1949) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the control of accommodation in 
certain hotels in the Union territory of Delhi. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Dominion 
Legislature and received the assent of the Governor General on the 22nd April, 1949. 
The Law Commission in its 248th  report at Serial number 57 under Chapter 4 of the 
Report, has also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. The Law Commission 
observed that the aforesaid Act grants the Director of Estates the power to reserve up to one-
fourth of the total accommodation available in certain private hotels in Delhi for use by 
government officials. The aforesaid Act was brought into force for the purpose of addressing 
the issue of accommodation shortage for government officials in Delhi. However, this issue 
is no longer alive as India Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) hotels and State guest 
houses can be used for making arrangements for the accommodation of government officials 
243 
in transit. In this context, this can be argued to be unconstitutional, violative of Article 
19(1)(g). Hence, this Act should be repealed. The Delhi Hotels (Control of Accommodation) 
Repeal Bill, 2014 is pending in the Rajya Sabha at present, and should be passed. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Si. No.71 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed inter alia stated that the aforesaid Act is an archaic law, which empowers the 
government to force bookings in hotels in Delhi for government employees. The Act serves 
no conceivable purpose now because arrangements for transit accommodation for 
government officials can be made through the India Tourism Development Corporation 
(ITDC) hotels and in State guest houses. It further stated that the Delhi Hotel (Control of 
Accommodation) Repeal Bill, 2014, which seeks repeal of this Act for the above reasons, is 
pending in the Rajya Sabha. Instead of an individual repeal bill, however, this Act may be 
repealed through an omnibus repealing Act. 
The Ministry of Urban Development vide their O.M. No. A-49020/12/2014-Coord 
dated 17th September, 2014 has informed that they have decided to repeal the Act on the 
ground that it is an old law which has outlived its utility. Accordingly a Bill to repeal the 
said Act has been introduced in the Rajya Sabha in February, 2014. Further a cabinet note 
has been circulated seeking approval to continue with the legislative process. 
Attention may be drawn to the Delhi Hotels (Control of Accommodation) Repeal 
Bill, 2014 which is pending in the Rajya Sabha at present for repeal of the aforesaid Act. 
Since, the aforesaid Bill for repealing the Delhi Hotels (Control of Accommodation) 
Act, 1949 is pending in the Rajya Sabha, the same has not been included in the Repealing 
Bill, 2014 appended to this Report. 
In view of liberalisation of the economy and globalisation and above, the 
Committee feels that the aforesaid Bill may be pursued for enactment by the 
Legislatures or the Delhi Hotels (Control of Accommodation) Repeal Bill, 2014 may be 
withdrawn with the leave of the Rajya Sabha and included in the Repealing Bill, 2014 
to be introduced in the ensuing Session of Parliament. 
666. The Displaced Persons (Debt Adjustment) Act, 1951 (LXX of 1951) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to make certain provisions for the adjustment and 
settlement of debts due by displaced persons, for the recovery of certain debts due to them 
and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. 
The aforesaid Act inter cilia contains provisions for making an application within one 
year from the date of commencement of the aforesaid Act by the displaced debtor to the 
Tribunals constituted under section 4 of the aforesaid Act, claims against insurance 
companies in respect of properties in West Pakistan belonging to a displaced person before 
the 15th day of August, 1947, non payment of interest in respect of unpaid amount on 
shares in companies or cooperative societies or non-forfeiting the shares held by the 
displaced persons and decrees passed by the tribunals etc., registration of certain societies 
and companies situated in the territory forming part of West Pakistan under the Companies 
Act or the Societies Registration Act, 1860 in India where majority of the share holders are 
the members are residing. 
In nut shell the aforesaid Act aim for addressing the issues of the displaced persons on 
the 15th August, 1947 due to division of India as it stood before that date. 
Since sixty-three years have elapsed from the enactment of the aforesaid Act, the 
Committee feels that the aforesaid Act after incorporating the savings for the matters 
provided in the aforesaid Act can be repealed in consultation with the administrative 
Ministry, which may have knowledge of the cases pending under the aforesaid Act and 
the number of shareholders likely to be adversely affected. 
244 
667. The Railway Companies (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1951 
(51 Of 1951) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to make provision for the proper management 
and administration of railway companies in certain special cases. 
The aforesaid Act inter alia applies to every railway companies in respect of which a 
notified order is issued under section 3. Section 3 of the aforesaid Act confers power upon 
the Central Government to apply that Act to any railway companies and to appoint directors 
thereof. Sections 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12 and 15 contains provisions relating to such directors. 
Section 13 contain provisions for application of the provisions of the Companies Act. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has recommended for repeal of this Act at serial No. 71 of 
Apendix-A-1 (166 Central Acts recommended for repeal by the Central Government). 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No.39 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed inter alia stated that since the entire railway system is now government owned, the 
purpose of the aforesaid Act is spent. Presently, the Railways Act, 1989 comprehensively 
deals with the laws relating to railways. It further stated that there are no legal issues that 
would impede repeal. 
The Planning Commission also at serial No. 6 of its I.D.No.25/04/2014 OM & C 
dated 11th September,2014 has recommended for its repeal. 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at Si. No. 70 under Chapter 2 of 
the Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission observed the 
aforesaid Act provided for the proper management and administration of railway companies 
in certain special cases. The Act empowered the Central Government to appoint a certain 
number of people for managing the affairs of any railway company in case that company 
prejudicially affects the convenience of the persons using it or causes serious dislocation in 
any trade or industry using that railway. Railways in India was nationalised in 1951 and the 
law relating to railways has now been consolidated in the form of the Railways Act, 1989. 
There is no evidence of any recent use of this Act. Hence, the Central Government should 
repeal this Act the Law Commission further stated that Planning Commission in its letter 
No. 25/04/2014-0M&C dated 18th September 2014 to the Member Secretary, Law 
Commission of India. 
The Ministry of Railways vide their O.M. No. 2014/0&M/18/6 dated the 22nd 
October, 2014 in the Annexure thereto, at SI. 10 have stated as under:— 
"Reason for retaining the Act has been indicated by the then Secretary, Railway Board's" D.O. letter No. 
ERB-1/97/23/14 dated 26.07.1999 (Appendix-II) Legal Opinion is attached with the said letter:. 
More than fourteen years have elapsed since the advice of the Department of 
Legal Affairs and aforesaid position Act stated in the D.O. letter No. ERB-1/97/23/14 
dated 26.07.2014. In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be 
repealed after consultation with the Ministry of Railways in today's context. 
668. The Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act, 
1952 (30 of 1952) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the requisitioning and acquisition 
of the immovable property for the purposes of the Union. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No.88 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed inter alia stated that the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land 
Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 includes acquisition for strategic 
purposes. The provisions of the LARR Act relating to land acquisition, compensation, 
rehabilitation and resettlement apply when the appropriate government acquires land for its 
245 
own use, to hold and control including for public sector undertakings and for public purpose. 
The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and 
Resettlement Act, 2013 also includes the acquisition for strategic purposes relating to naval, 
military air force, and armed forces of the Union. The aforesaid Act has to comply with 
provisions made relating to compensation, rehabilitation and resettlement of the Right to Fair 
Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 
2013, within a year of commencement of the latter. This means that, if the central 
government directs, that the provisions of any other law for land acquisition as provided in 
the 4th schedule of the Act, must comply with the provisions of the Right to Fair 
Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 
2013 (as per section 105). Hence, the provisions of the Act will need to be amended to 
comply with the provisions of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land 
Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013which is far more humane in its 
provisions. We recommend repeal instead of this amendment, since the responsibilities of 
the Act can be executed under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land 
Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. It further stated that the repeal of the 
Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act, 1952 (30 of 1952) may 
entail amendment in the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, 
Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 to provide for temporary acquisition of 
immovable property. 
Recently, the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, 
Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 has been enacted on the 27th September, 2013. 
Section 105 of this Act specifically mentions that the provisions of the Right to Fair 
Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 
2013 shall not apply or apply with certain modifications to the Requisitioning and 
Acquisition of Immovable Property Act, 1952 (30 of 1952) specified at Sl. No.9 in the 
Fourth Schedule to the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, 
Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. 
The "public purpose" for acquisition of land under the Right to Fair Compensation 
and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 under 
sub-section (1) of section 2 of that Act is vide enough to include the purposes of the 
Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act, 1952 and clauses (a) to (0 of 
sub-section (1) of section 2 of the aforesaid Act are is inclusive i.e., suggestive/illustrative 
and not specific or restrictive. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be considered for repeal after 
consultation with the concerned Ministry.

Government). 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th Report at Sl. No. 29 under Chapter 2 of the

recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission, inter alia, observed

would not apply to any bank note of the denominational value of Rs. 500, Rs. 1000 or Rs. 
10,000 issued after the commencement of this Act, but no such bank note issued before 13th 
January 1946 shall be legal tender in payment or on account of the amount expressed therein 
at any place in India. The Act has served its purpose. Hence, the Central Government should 
repeal this Act. The Ministry of Law and Justice should also ascertain the status of the High 
Denomination Bank Notes (Demonetisation) Ordinance, 1946 and if it is still in force, the 
Central Government should repeal this Ordinance as well. A suitable savings clause should 
be inserted in the repealing Act. 
The aforesaid Act contains 9 sections out of which sections 2 to 8 were repealed by 
the Repealing and Amending Act, 1957 (36 of 1957). Section 1 relating to short title and 
section 9 relating to non-application of Ordinance 3 of 1946 in certain high denomination 
bank notes are surviving. 
Section 9 of the aforesaid Act reads as under:— 
"Ordinance 3 of 1946 not to apply to certain high denomination bank notes.- 9. Nothing contained in 
the High Denomination Bank Notes (Demonetisation) Ordinance, 1946 (3 of 1946) shall apply to any 
bank note of the denominational value of five hundred rupees, one thousand rupees or ten thousand 
rupees issued after the commencement of this Act, but no such bank note issued before the 13th day 
of January, 1946 (3 of 1946) shall be legal tender in payment or on account of the amount expressed 
therein at any place in India.". 
Attention is invited to clause (d) of section 2 and section 3 of the High Denomination 
Bank Notes (Demonetisation) Act, 1978 which reads as under:- 
[2(d) "high denomination bank note" means a bank note of the denominational value of one thousand 
rupees, five thousand rupees or ten thousand rupees, issued by the Reserve Bank ;] 
The aforesaid definition specified in clause (d) was amended by section 2 of the High 
Denomination Bank Notes (Demonetisation) Amendment Act, 1999 (3 of 1999) and the 
words ' issued by the Reserve Bank immediately before the commencement of this Act 'were 
inserted. After this amendment, the definition in section 2(d) of the aforesaid Act would read 
as under:— 
[section 2(d) "high denomination bank note" means a bank note of the denominational value of 
one thousand rupees, five thousand rupees or ten thousand rupees, issued by the Reserve Bank 
immediately before the commencement of this Act ;]. 
The commencement date of the High Denomination Bank Notes (Demonetisation) 
Act, 1978 is the 16th day of January, 1978 as mentioned in sub-section (3) of section of the 
aforesaid Act. 
Attention is also invited to section 3 of the High Denomination Bank Notes 
(Demonetisation) Act, 1978 reads as under:— 
[section3. High denomination bank notes to cease to be legal tender. 
On the expiry of the 16th day of January, 1978, all high denomination bank notes shall, 
notwithstanding anything contained in section 26 of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, cease to be 
legal tender in payment or on account at any place.] 
Sections 26 and 26A of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 reads as under:— 
[section26. Legal tender character of notes.- (I) Subject to the provisions of sub-section (2), every 
bank note shall be legal tender at any place in India in payment or on account for the amount expressed 
therein, and shall be guaranteed by the Central Government. 
(2) On recommendation of the Central Board, the Central Government may, by notification in the 
Gazette of India, declare that, with effect from such date as may be specified in the notification, any 
series of bank notes of any denomination shall cease to be legal tender save at such office or agency of

[section26A. Certain bank notes to cease to be legal tender. 
Notwithstanding anything contained in section 26, no bank note of the denominational value of five 
hundred rupees, one thousand rupees or ten thousand rupees issued before the 13th day of January,

The Department of Financial Services has at Serial No. 9 of its D.O. letter 
No.9/15/2014-Coord. dated 12th September, 2014 conveyed that the Reserve Bank of India 
247

after RBI's Comments are received. 
The Department has further stated that the provisions of the aforesaid Act are in 
vogue and amendments in the light of changing socio-economic environment have been/are 
being carried out and there is always scope for amendments/modifications. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the Reserve Bank of India 
(Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1953 which contains provisions in 
relation to the High Denomination Bank Notes (Demonetisation) Ordinance, 1946 (3 
of 1946) may not be relevant in today's context and can be repealed after confirmation 
from the concerned Ministry/Department after inserting a saving clause in the 
Repealing Bill, 2014.

Act, 1954 (23 of 1954)

Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. The Law Commission, inter alia, 
observed that the aforesaid Act validated the acquisition under the Land Acquisition Act, 
1894 of lands by certain State Governments for the purposes of the Union and orders passed 
and proceedings held in connection therewith. The 1894 Act has now been repealed. The 
purpose of this Act has been fulfilled. Hence, it can be repealed after inserting a suitable 
savings clause in the repealing Act. 
The administrative Ministry may take a considered view for repeal of the 
aforesaid Act after incorporating saving clause in the Repealing Bill, 2014.

therewith.

recommended 
that the aforesaid Act be repealed, subject to factual checking, as to whether any such 
deposits still remain undisposed of.

administrative Ministry.

Manipur and Tripura (as these then were). The Act provided for: Firstly, when the Assam 
Co-operative Societies Act, 1949 would be extended to the Union territory of Manipur, the

operative Societies Act, 1976 is now in force and has repealed Assam Co-operative Societies 
Act, 1949 in its operation to Manipur. Secondly, when the Bombay Co-operative Societies 
Act, 1925 and the Bombay Money Lenders Act, 1946 would be extended to the Union

The P.C. Jain Commission in its Report at Sl. No.154 of Annexure-A-1 (166 Central 
Acts to be repealed by the Central Government) has recommended for repeal of the aforesaid 
Act. 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at Si. No. 37 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission, inter alia, observed 
that the aforesaid Act was enacted to validate the constitution and proceedings of the 
Legislative Assembly of Himachal Pradesh which was formed under the Himachal Pradesh 
and Bilaspur (New State) Act, 1954. The Act prescribed that no court shall question any Act 
passed, or any grant, resolution, proceeding or thing made, passed, adopted, taken or done, 
by or before the new Legislative Assembly merely on the ground that the new Legislative 
Assembly had not been duly constituted. The Act was enacted specifically to validate the 
proceedings of the Assembly between 1st July 1954 and 31st October 1956. The Act was 
clearly time-specific and has now served its purpose. Hence, the Central Government should 
repeal this Act with a suitable savings clause. 
The aforesaid Act consists of five sections. Section 1 relates to short title, section 2 
relates to definitions of certain expressions, section 3 relates to validation of the constitution 
and proceedings of the Legislative Assembly of the then newly constituted State of 
Himachal Pradesh, section 4 relating to court not to question the validity of proceedings of 
newly constituted Legislative Assembly on the ground of defect in constitution etc. and 
section 5 relates to repeal of the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly (Constitution and 
Proceedings) Validation Ordinance, 1958. The P.C. Jain Commission recommended repeal 
of the validation legislations by making a saving provision. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed after incorporating 
a saving provision in the Repealing Bill, 2014 for the proceedings validated by the 
aforesaid Act.

Schedule instituted or disposed of before the date on which this sub-section comes into force 
(i.e., 20.07.1954). Section 21 contains provision for certain decrees and orders passed by 
any court or other authority to be null and void. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed with a saving clause 
in the Repealing Bill, 2014, in consultation with the concerned Ministry or Department.

Excise and Customs) Act, 1958 (59 of 1959)

countervailing duties on imported goods in certain cases between the periods commencing 
from 01.04.1959 to 31.10.1959. Section 4 was a temporary provision and had served the 
purpose and outlived its utility. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed after making a 
saving clause in the Repealing Bill, 2014 in consultation with the administrative 
Ministry. 
683. The Delhi Land Holdings (Ceiling) Act, 1960 (24 of 1960) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the imposition of a ceiling on land 
holdings in the Union territory of Delhi and for matters connected therewith. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No.76 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed inter alia, stated that the aforesaid Act provides for the imposition of land ceilings, 
i.e., upper cap and limit, on the amount of land one can hold in the Lal Dora areas of the 
Union Territory of Delhi and for matters connected therewith. The Urban Land Ceiling Act, 
1976, a similar central legislation, was repealed in 1999 on the ground that it created an 
artificial shortage in the supply of land, which resulted in a steep rise in land prices, 
adversely impacting accessibility and affordability of land, particularly for the poor. 
Similarly, this Act runs counter to the government's aim of providing cheap and affordable 
housing. It further stated that there are no legal issues that would impede repeal. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed in consultation with 
the concerned administrative Ministry 
684. The Sugar (Regulation of Production) Act, 1961 (55 of 1961) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the regulation of production of 
sugar in the interests if the general public and for the levy and collection of a special excise 
duty on sugar produced by a factory in excess of the quota fixed for the purpose. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No.77 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed inter alia stated that the aforesaid Act gives wide powers to control the production 
of sugar and is out of sync with the move towards deregulation of the sugar industry that has 
been taking place since 1997. In any case, the Act has not been in use in the last few 
decades, even before the process of deregulation began. The sugar industry is instead 
regulated through Orders under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. The Competition 
Commission of India (CCI) has characterised the many laws and rules governing the sugar 
industry as a regulatory stranglehold. The CCI observed that the sugar industry is controlled 
by various Acts, Rules and Orders, and this web of legislative provisions means that sugar 
prices are not free to be determined by the market forces of demand and supply. The Special 
Economic Zones Act, 2005 (SEZ Act) excludes the operation of this Act in a Special 
Economic Zone. While this is not in itself ground for repeal, perhaps it is an indication that 
this cess is a hindrance to economic activity and should not operate anywhere else in the 
country. It further stated that no rules or orders operate under the Act. There are no legal 
implications due to the repeal of the Act. 
Since, the sugar industry is regulated through the Orders issued under the 
Essential Commodities Act, 1955, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be 
254 
repealed in consultation with the concerned administrative Ministry to avoid the 
multiplicity of control over sugar industry. 
685.The Tripura Municipal Law (Repeal) Act, 1960 (31 of 1960)

practice to clean the Statutes Book. In the past, the Criminal Tribes Laws (Repeal) Act, 1952 
(24 of 1952), has been repealed by the Repealing and Amending Act, 1957 (36 of 1957), the 
Press Council (Repeal) Act, 1976 (24 of 1976) has been repealed by the Repealing and 
Amending Act, 1988 (19 of 1980) and the Gold Control (Repeal) Act, 1990 (18 of 1990) has

fund to ensure that the price of levy sugar may be uniform throughout India. 'Levy sugar' is 
the 10% of sugar output that every sugar manufacturer has to sell to the government at 
reduced rates for the Public Distribution System (PDS). In view of the ongoing process of 
deregulating sugar, the Union Cabinet in 2013 approved the removal of levy sugar, initially 
261 
for a period of 2 years. The need for this Act is therefore being done away with. Hence, the 
Central Government should repeal this Act after introducing a suitable savings clause. This 
Act has been recommended for repeal by the Planning Commission in its letter No. 
25/04/2014-OM&C dated 18th September 2014 to the Member Secretary, Law Commission 
of India. 
The Planning Commission has also at serial No. 8 of its I.D.No.25/04/2014 OM & C 
dated 11th September,2014 has also recommended for its repeal. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act may be repealed in consultation with 
the concerned administrative Ministry. 
705. The Dangerous Machines (Regulation) Act, 1983 (35 of 1983) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the regulation of trade and 
commerce in, and production, supply, distribution and use of, the product of any industry 
producing dangerous machines with a view to securing the welfare of labour, operating any 
such machine and for payment of compensation for the death or bodily injury suffered by 
any labourer while operating any such machine, and for matters connected therewith or 
incidental thereto. It came into force on the 14th December, 1983. 
Section 36 of the aforesaid Act confers powers upon the Central Government to 
make rules for the matters relating to the licence to be issued under sub-section (2) of section 
9, standards to be complied by the manufacturers of the dangerous machines and for 
modifications of the dangerous machines existing before the commencement of the aforesaid 
Act. 
The Department of Agriculture and Cooperation vide its OM No. 35-13/2014-
O&M/PG dated 15th September, 2014 stated that the State Governments have been 
consulted and most of the States have recommended it's repeal. They further stated that the 
implementing authorities i.e., the State Governments have recommended repeal of this Act 
as none of the States are implementing it. 
While perusing the aforesaid Act, it was observed that the State of Odisha in exercise 
of the powers under section 37 of the Dangerous Machines (Regulation) Act, 1983 has made 
Odisha Dangerous Machines (Regulation) Rules, 2008 vide its SRO No. 54/2008 dated 31st 
December, 2008. 
Since, as stated by the administrative Ministry "none of the States are implementing it" 
and in view of above, the aforesaid Act can be repealed in consultation with the 
concerned Ministry 
706.The National Oilseeds and Vegetables oils Development Board Act, 
1983 (29 of 1983) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the development under the control 
of the Union of the oilseed industry and the vegetable oils industry and for matters connected

consideration to seek opinion of Law Ministry/ Seeking Cabinet approval and further stated 
that they proposed to repeal the Act in due course. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed in consultation with 
the concerned Ministry 
262 
707.The Disputed Elections (Prime Minister and Speaker) Act, 1977 
(16 of 1977) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for Authorities to deal with disputed 
elections to Parliament in the case of Prime Minister and Speaker of the House of the People 
and for matter's connected therewith. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No.93 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alma, stated that the aforesaid Act provided that the general procedure for 
disputing an election by way of presenting an election petition to the High Court, would not 
apply in cases where the elected representative went on to become the Prime Minister or 
Speaker of the Lok Sabha. In such cases, this special law would apply, and election petitions 
questioning their elections would be heard by a single judge of the Supreme Court as a 
separate authority set up under this Act. The decisions of the authority were deemed final. In 
order to permit the special treatment of these representatives, a Constitutional amendment, 
Article 329A, was introduced which allowed this distinction to be made. Both the 
amendment and this law were created during the time the Emergency proclamation was in 
place. Article 329A, which made it possible for this law to exist, was subsequently removed 
through the 44th Amendment to the Constitution in 1978. Without Article 329A, this law 
stands unconstitutional, as the Constitution does not allow a distinction to be made between 
the election disputes of different types of elected representatives. The aforesaid Act has been 
used only once in 1977, when an Authority was set up to try election petitions against 
Morarji Desai, who headed the Janata coalition government. Not only is it a redundant law, 
but also one that represents concentration of power, and the breakdown of the rule of law 
during the Emergency. It further stated that there are no legal issues that would impede 
repeal. 
Attention is invited to the Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the 
Constitution (Forty-fifth Amendment) Bill, 1977(Bill No. 88 of 1978) enacted as the 
Constitution (Forty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1978 which omitted article 329A of the 
Constitution. The aforesaid article 329A contained special provisions as to elections to 
Parliament in the case of Prime Minister and Speaker. 
Attention is invited to the commentary on the subject in the book titled "Durga Das 
Basu Shorter Constitution of India", 13th Edition, reprinted in 2003 at page 1537, the 
extracts of which is as under: 
"Forum for adjudication of Election Petitions.— I. Under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, as it 
stood prior to 1966, the forum for hearing an election petition was an Election Tribunal. 
H. By an amendment of 1966, the jurisdiction was transferred to the High Court, sitting as a statutory tribunal 
(sec. 80A), with appeal to the Supreme Court under s. 116A of the Act. No appeal lies from Single Judge to 
Division Bench. 
III. The Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act sought to take away this statutory jurisdiction of the High Court, 
and to revert to the pre-1966 position, with the following changes: 
A distinction was made between the generality of cases, and an election proceeding to challenge the 
election to Parliament of the Prime Minister and Speaker. 
So far as the election of the person who eventually becomes the Prime Minister or the Speaker is 
concerned, the forum would be an authority to be set up by law made by Parliament,—
Which need not be an election Tribunal. 
This provision empowering Parliament to make such law [article 329A] was inserted by the Constitution (39th 
Amendment) Act, 1975. Article 329A has, however, been repealed by the Constitution (44th Amendment) Act, 
1978". 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the repeal of the aforesaid Act may be 
considered by the administrative Ministry in consultation with the Ministry of Law and 
Justice. The administrative Ministry have not given any views in respect of the repeal 
of the aforesaid Act in the information furnished to the Committee. 
263 
708.The Central Laws (Extension to Arunachal Pradesh) Act, 1993 
(44 of 1993) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the extension of certain Central 
laws to the State of Arunachal Pradesh. The aforesaid Act came into force from 1st July, 
1994. 
The P.C. Jain Commission in its Report at Si. No.97 of Appendix A-1 (166 Central 
Acts recommended for repeal) had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at Sl. No. 69 under Chapter 2 of the Report 
had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the earlier recommendations of 
the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission, inter alia, observed that the aforesaid Act 
was enacted to provide for the extension of certain Central laws to the State of Arunachal 
Pradesh. The Act so extended find mention in the Schedule appended to the Act. 
Corresponding amendments have been made to the Short Title, Extent and Commencement 
clause of these Acts to provide for their extension to the State of Arunachal Pradesh. Hence, 
this Act has now served its purpose and the Central Government should now repeal this Act. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act may be repealed in consultation with 
the concerned administrative Ministry 
709.The Punjab Gram Panchayat Samithi and ZillaParishad (Chandigarh) 
Repeal Act, 1994 (17 of 1994) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to repeal the Punjab Gram Panchayat Act, 1952 
and the Punjab Panchayat Samities and Zilla Parishads Act, 1961 as in force in the Union 
territory of Chandigarh. 
The P.C. Jain Commission in its Report at SI. No.109 of Appendix A-5 (114 Central 
Acts recommended for repeal by State Governments) had recommended for repeal of the 
aforesaid Act 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at SI. No. 71 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission, inter alia, observed 
that the aforesaid Act was enacted to enacted to repeal the Punjab Gram Panchayat Act, 
1952 and the Punjab Panchayat Samities and Zilla Parishads Act, 1961 as in force the Union 
territory of Chandigarh. Both these Acts have been repealed by the Punjab Panchayati Raj 
Act, 1994 which extends to the whole State of Punjab. Hence, the Chandigarh Repeal Act of 
1994 is now redundant. The Central Government should repeal this Act. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act may be repealed in consultation with 
the concerned administrative Ministry.

SECTION-1 
CENTRAL ACTS RELATING TO ACQUISITION OF 
UNDERTAKING/ACQUISITION AND TRANSFER OF 
UNDERTAKINGS 
(See paragraph 11 above) 
710. The Metal Corporation of India (Acquisition and Undertaking) 
Act, 1965 (44 of 1965) 
The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No. 1222 of 1966 (Union of India Vs. the 
Metal Corporation of India) decided on 5th September, 1966 held that that the Metal 
Corporation of India (Acquisition and Undertaking) Act, 1965 as unconstitutional as the 
aforesaid Act does not provide for compensation. 
Subsequently the Metal Corporation of India (Acquisition and Undertaking) Act, 1966 
(36 of 1966) was enacted. The aforesaid Act was also repealed by the Metal Corporation of 
India (Nationalisation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1976 (100 of 1976) and the 
undertakings of the Metal Corporation of India which had earlier vested in the Central 
Government under the Metal Corporation of India (Acquisition and Undertaking) Act, 1966

1972 (58 of 1972) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the acquisition of the undertaking 
of the Indian Copper Corporation Limited for the purpose of enabling the Central Government 
to conserve and exploit, in a scientific and rational manner, to the maximum advantage of the 
nation, the copper deposits in the Singhbhum belt in the State of Bihar, to utilise the copper 
268 
deposits in such manner as to subserve the common good, in the context of the requirements 
Of copper in the country, and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No.41 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that the aforesaid Act only provides for the acquisition of the 
undertaking of the Indian Copper Corporation, and has no provisions with respect to its 
management or operations. The Companies Act now governs the management of the 
company. The aforesaid Act is no longer relevant to the present-day functioning of Hindustan 
Copper and may be repealed. It is stated that no pending cases exist under the Act and 
therefore there is no obstacle to repeal. It further stated that the aforesaid Act is listed in the 
9th Schedule to the Constitution. While this does not affect the repeal process, an amendment 
to the Constitution will have to remove this Act from the list at a later date after its repeal. 
The aforesaid Act would required to be repealed in consultation with the concerned 
Ministry and the Ministry of Law and Justice in view of the aforesaid Act appearing at Sl. No. 
96 of the Nineth Schedule to the Constitution of India46..

The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the acquisition and transfer of the 
undertaking of the Richardson and Cruddas Limited, for the reconstruction of the register of 
its members and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No.42 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that the aforesaid Act has no role to play in the management and 
recovery attempts of the Richardson and Cruddas Company. Its repeal will not affect the 
process of recovery. It further stated that there are no legal issues that would impede repeal. 
714. The Alcock Ashdown Company Limited (Acquisition of 
Undertakings) Act, 1973 (56 of 1973) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the acquisition of the undertakings 
of the Alcock Ashdown Company Limited for the purpose of ensuring rational and co-
ordinated development and production of goods essential to the needs of the country in 
general, and defence department in particular and for matters connected therewith or 
incidental thereto. 
715. The Konkan Passenger Ships (Acquisition) Act, 1973 (62 of 1973) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the acquisition and transfer of the 
Konkan passenger ships in order to serve better the needs of the maritime passengers of the 
Konkan coastal region and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. 
716. The Esso (Acquisition of Undertakings in India) Act, 1974 (4 of 1974) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the acquisition and transfer of the 
right, title and interest of Esso Eastern Inc. in relation to its undertakings in India with a view 
to ensuring co-ordinated distribution and utilisation of petroleum products distributed and 
marketed in India by Esso Eastern Inc. and for matters connected therewith or incidental 
thereto. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No.43 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that the aforesaid Act deals only with acquisition, and not 
269 
management of the company, which now exists as HPCL, and is governed by the Companies 
Act. Repealing the aforesaid Act will therefore not have any effect on the functioning of the 
company. In 2003, in the case of Centre for Public Interest Litigation v. Union of India, the 
Supreme Court held that the sale of shares of HPCL could not take place through executive 
order, since the formation of HPCL had taken place through acquisition statues, including the 
Esso (Acquisition of Undertakings in India) Act, 1974. For sale of its shares, therefore, either 
Parliamentary approval would have to be obtained or the acquisition statutes (including this 
one) would have to be repealed. It further stated that the repeal of the aforesaid Act might send 
out signals in the market of impending disinvestment in the oil and gas sector, which has 
remained a contentious issue. 
717. The Burmah Shell (Acquisition of Undertakings in India) Act, 1976 
(2 of 1976) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the acquisition and transfer of the 
right, title and interest of the Burmah Shall Oil Storage and Distributing Company of India 
Limited in relation to its undertakings in India with a view to ensuring co-ordinated 
distribution and utilisation of petroleum products distributed and marketed in India by the said 
company and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Si. No.46 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that the aforesaid Act provided for the acquisition of the Burmah 
Shell Oil Storage and Distributing Company of India Limited (BSD) to ensure coordinated 
distribution and utilisation of petroleum products. It provided that on the appointed date, the 
right, title and interest of Burmah Shell undertakings in India would be transferred to the 
central government. It further gave the power to the central government to transfer these 
holdings to a government company. The government paid Rs. 27.75 crores to the parent 
company Burmah Shell for this acquisition under the Act. The government acquired at the 
same time the Burmah Shell Refineries Limited, and vested all assets of the BSD in this 
company, which was later renamed Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) in 1977. It 
further stated that the aforesaid Act deals with only the acquisition and not the management of 
the company, which has merged with BPCL. BPCL is managed by its Board of Directors 
constituted under the Companies Act, 1956, consisting of Government of India nominees and 
independent Directors. Repealing this Act will therefore not have an effect on the existence or 
functioning of the company. The plan for disinvestment in HPCL and BPCL was proposed by 
the Department of Disinvestment in 2002. In 2003, the Supreme Court (in the same judgment 
mentioned in the previous entry) stalled the sale of shares of BPCL saying that since the 
company had been acquired under the Burmah Shell (Acquisition of Undertakings in India) 
Act, privatisation could not proceed through executive order. According to the Court, the Act 
would either have to be repealed, or Parliamentary approval would have to be obtained for the 
privatisation to go ahead. It further stated that the repeal of the aforesaid Act might send out 
signals in the market of impending disinvestment in the oil and gas sector, which has remained 
a contentious issue. 
718. The Assam Sillimanite Limited (Acquisition and Transfer of 
Refractory Plant) Act, 1976 (22 of 1976). 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the acquisition and transfer of the 
right, title and interest of the Assam Sillimanite Limited in respect of its Refractory Plant and 
for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. 
270 
719. The Braithwaite and Company (India) Limited (Acquisition and 
Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1976 (96 of 1976). 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the acquisition and transfer of the 
undertakings of Messrs. Braithwaite and Company (India) Limited for the purpose of ensuring 
the continuity of production of good which are vital to the needs of the country, and for 
matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No.47 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that the aforesaid Act enabled the acquisition of Braithwaite and 
Company (India) Limited to undo the mismanagement by its erstwhile managing agents and 
Board of Directors, which had seriously affected the production and supply of goods. 
Braithwaite is engaged in the manufacture and production of railway wagons and intricate 
components required by the railway industry. The aforesaid Act transferred all assets, rights, 
powers and properties of the company to the central government. It also provided for 
compensation of Rs. 16 crores to be paid to the company in return for the transfer of assets. 
Currently, Braithwaite is a subsidiary to the Bharat Bhari Udyog Nigam Limited (BBUNL) 
and under the administrative control of the Department of Heavy Industries. Braithwaite was 
declared sick and referred to the BIFR in 1992. The Government has been seeking to dis-
invest Braithwaite since 2002-2003. In 2010, the Cabinet approved the financial restructuring 
of Braithwaite and transferred it to the Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL). The Cabinet 
also plans to provide loans to Braithwaite for its revival. The aforesaid Act has no role to play 
in the management and recovery attempts of Braithwaite. Its repeal will not affect the process 
of recovery. It further stated that there are no legal issues that would impede repeal. 
720. The Smith, Stanistreet and Company Limited (Acquisition and 
Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1977 (41 of 1977) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for, in the public interest, the 
acquisition and transfer of the right, title and interest of the undertakings of Messrs. Smith, 
Stanistreet and Company Limited, Calcutta and for matters connected therewith or incidental 
thereto. 
The Centre for Civil Society at 51. No.48 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that the aforesaid Act enabled the acquisition of Smith, Stanistreet 
and Company Limited, engaged in the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceuticals and 
chemicals. The stated reason was that the company was being managed in a manner highly 
detrimental to public interest, and suffering from heavy losses. The aforesaid Act transferred 
all assets, rights, powers and properties of the company to the central government, and 
declared those assets to be free of all encumbrances or obligations. It also provided for 
compensation of almost Rs. 4 crores to be paid to the company in return of the transfer of 
assets. The Company had been incurring financial losses and was formally declared sick by 
the Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) in 1992. In 2001, the BIFR 
confirmed its opinion that it was just and equitable in public interest that the company should 
be wound up. The Central Government decided to close the Company and separated the 
employees by offering Voluntary Separation Scheme (VSS) to them. Consequently, this 
Company has been closed. Since the company has now been closed and is not operating 
currently, the acquisition act does not serve any purpose. It further stated that there are no 
legal issues that would impede repeal. 
271 
721.The Gresham and Craven of India (Private) Limited (Acquisition 
and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1977 (42 of 1977) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the acquisition and transfer of the 
undertakings of Messrs. Gresham and Craven of India (Private) Limited for the purpose of 
ensuring the continuity of production of goods which are vital to the needs of the Railways , 
and of the industries manufacturing engineering products and for matters connected therewith 
or incidental thereto. 
722. The Hindustan Tractors Limited (Acquisition and Transfer of 
Undertakings) Act, 1978 (13 of 1978) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the acquisition and transfer of the 
undertakings of Hindustan Tractors Limited, Vishwamitri, Vadodara, for the purpose of 
ensuring the continuity of production of goods which are vital to meet the needs of the general 
public and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. 
The Centre for Civil Society at 51. No.51 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed inter alia stated that the aforesaid Act provided for the acquisition and transfer of the 
undertakings of Hindustan Tractors Limited. The stated reason was to ensure the continuity of 
production of goods, which were vital to meet the needs of the general public. It also provided 
for compensation of Rs. 150 lakhs to be paid by the central government to the company in 
return of the transfer of assets. Under Section 6 of this Act, the central government transferred 
the undertakings of the Company to the Government of the state of Gujarat. Consequently, all 
assets, rights, powers and properties of the company were transferred to the Government of 
Gujarat. In 1999, the Mahindra and Mahindra Group acquired 60% of Hindustan Tractors 
Limited, and by 2001 the rest of the company was also purchased. It was then renamed to 
Mahindra Gujarat Tractors Ltd., and is now a Mahindra and Mahindra enterprise. Since 
Hindustan Tractors Ltd. has been privatised, repeal of the acquisition act would not have any 
effect on its management. It further stated that there are no legal issues that would impede 
repeal. 
723. The Deposit Insurance Corporations (Amendment and 
Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1978 (21 of 1978) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the acquisition and transfer of the 
undertaking of the Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Limited in order to serve better the 
need for providing credit guarantee to commercial banks, and further to amend the Deposit 
Insurance Corporation Act, 1961, and the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, and for matters 
connected therewith or incidental thereto. 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at Si. No. 61 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. The Law Commission, inter alia, 
observed that the aforesaid Act provided for the acquisition and transfer of the undertaking of 
the Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Limited in order to serve better the need for 
providing credit guarantee to commercial banks. The Act also amended the Deposit Insurance 
Corporation Act, 1961 and the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. Corresponding amendments 
have been carried out in both these Acts. However, since this Act also provides for the 
particulars of the merger of the Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Credit Guarantee 
Corporation of India Limited, the Central Government should consider repeal of this Act only 
after consultation with the Reserve Bank of India.

724. The Britannia Engineering Company Limited (Mokameh Unit) and 
the Arthur Butler and Company (Muzaffarpore) Limited (Acquisition 
and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1978 (41 of 1978) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the acquisition and transfer of the 
right, title and interest of the undertakings of Britannia Engineering Company in relation to 
the Mokameh unit owner by it and the right, title and interest of Arthur Butler and Company 
in relation to the undertakings owned by it, with a view to ensuring the continued manufacture 
of railway wagons and other goods essential to the needs of the country in general and the 
Railways in particular, and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No.50 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter cilia, stated that the aforesaid Act enabled the nationalisation and subsequent 
amalgamation of two erstwhile companies, Arthur Butler & Co. located at Muzaffarpur, and 
Britannia Engineering Works located at Mokamah (both in Bihar). The decision of the 
Government was driven by the industrial sickness in both the companies. The aforesaid Act 
transferred all assets, rights, powers and properties of both companies to the central 
government. It also provided for compensation of Rs. 152.85 lakhs to Britannia Engineering 
and Rs. 137.70 lakhs to Arthur Butler and Company in return for the transfer of assets. Both 
the companies were amalgamated to form Bharat Wagon and Engineering Company Limited 
(BWEL) which is a 100% subsidiary of Bharat Bhari Udyog Nigam Limited (BBUNL). 
BWEL was declared sick and referred to the BIER in 2000. In 2008, the Cabinet Committee 
on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved the financial restructuring of BWEL and it was taken 
over by the Ministry of Railways. It further states that the aforesaid Act has no role to play in 
the management and recovery attempts of BWEL. Its repeal will not affect the process of 
recovery. It further stated that there are no legal issues that would impede repeal. 
725. The Bolani Ores Limited (Acquisition of Shares) and Miscellaneous 
Provisions Act, 1978 (42 of 1978) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the acquisition of shares of the 
Bolani Ores Limited in public interest in order to serve better the needs of the nation and to 
facilitate the promotion and development in the interests of the general public, of national 
steel industry and for mattes connected therewith or incidental thereto. 
726.The Kosan Gas Company (Acquisition of Undertakings) Act, 1979 
(28 of 1979) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the acquisition, in the public 
interest, of the undertaking of the Kosangas company and thereby to secure that the ownership 
and control of the means and resources for bottling, transporting, marketing and distribution of 
liquefied petroleum gas are so distributed as best to subserve the common good and for 
matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No.52 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alio, stated that the aforesaid Act enabled the acquisition of the undertakings 
of the Kosan Gas Company so as to secure the ownership and control of the means and 
resources for bottling, transport, marketing and distribution of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). 
This was done to ensure that distribution of LPG would sub-serve the common good. In 1979, 
Kosan Gas Company was merged with Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL). 
Plans to privatise HPCL have been in the pipeline for a considerable period of time now. It 
further stated that the judgement in Centre for Public Interest Litigation v. Union of India 
dealing with the privatisation of I IPCL holds relevance for Kosan Gas Company as well. The 
273 
sale of shares of HPCL could not take place through executive order, since the formation of 
HPCL had taken place through acquisition statues, including the Kosan Gas Company 
(Acquisition of Undertaking) Act, 1979. For sale of its shares, therefore, either Parliamentary 
approval would have to be obtained or the acquisition statutes, including this one, would have 
to be repealed. Even though this Act, does not find a mention in the Centre for Public Interest 
Litigation judgement, the privatisation of HPCL will likely entail repeal of this Act as well. It 
further there are no legal issues that would impede repeal. 
727.The National Company Limited (Acquisition and Transfer of 
Undertakings) Act, 1980 (42 of 1980)

India Limited, and of crude oil, gas and petroleum products produced by the undertakings in 
India of the Assam Oil Company Limited and the petroleum products marketed and 
distributed by the said undertakings and the undertakings in India of "The Burmah Oil 
Company (India Trading) Limited" are so distributed as best to sebserve the common good. 
734. The Amritsar -Oil Works (Acquisition and Transfer of 
Undertakings) Act, 1982 (50 of 1982) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the acquisition and transfer of the 
right, title and interest of the undertakings of the Amritsar Sugar Mills Company in relation to 
the Amritsar Oil Works with a view to sustaining and strengthening the nucleus of public 
owned or controlled units required for ensuring supply of wholesome vanaspati and refined 
edible oils to the public at reasonable prices and thereby to give effect to the policy of the 
State towards securing the principles specified in clause (b) and (c) of article 39 of the 
Constitution. 
The Centre for Civil Society at 51. No.54 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that the aforesaid Act enabled the complete nationalisation of 
275 
Amritsar Oil Works. The management of this company was taken over by the central 
government under the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951. This was done to 
ensure supply of refined edible oils to the public at reasonable prices. The aforesaid Act 
transferred all assets, rights, powers and properties of the Amritsar Oil Works to the central 
government. It also provided for compensation of about Rs. 65 lakhs to be paid to the 
company in return of the transfer of assets. By virtue of the aforesaid Act, the Hindustan 
Vegetable Oils Corporation Limited (HVOC) was formed which is a fully owned government 
company. Upon nationalisation, Amritsar Oil Works was taken over by HVOC. HVOC had 
been suffering severe financial losses and was declared sick by the BIFR in 1999. Pursuant to 
BIFR's order, the Government of India did not attempt revival and rehabilitation of the 
company and approved the introduction of VSS for their employees. It further stated that 
currently, none of the units of the HVOC are operational except the Breakfast Foods 
manufacturing unit in Delhi (also loss-making). The government has advised the Central 
Warehousing Corporation and Food Corporation of India to carry out a due diligence exercise 
to ascertain if they can take over HVOC along with its assets, liabilities and remaining 
manpower. The acquisition act has served its purpose. It now has no role to play in the 
management and recovery attempts of the HVOC (of which the Amritsar Oil Works is a part). 
It is further stated that there are no legal issues that would impede repeal. 
735.The Andhra Scientific Company Limited (Acquisition and Transfer

undertakings of the Hooghly Docking and Engineering Company Limited with a view to 
securing the better utilisation of the available infrastructure thereof, to modernise and increase 
the capacity for ship building and ship repairing so as to reduce the import of ships, vessels

said undertakings so as to subserve the interests of the general public by ensuring the 
continued supply of the said articles which are essential to the needs of the economy of the 
country, and for matters connected therewith and incidental thereto. 
The Centre for Civil Society at 51. No.55 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that the aforesaid Act provides for the acquisition and transfer of 
the undertakings of the Hooghly Docking and Engineering Company Limited to the central 
government. The acquisition was brought about to better utilise and increase the capacity for 
shipbuilding and ship repairing. In 2011, the Union Cabinet gave in-principle approval for the 
formation of a Joint Venture of Hooghly Dock and Port Engineers Limited (HDPEL) with a 
private sector player. HDPEL, India's oldest ship-builder, is reeling under severe financial 
losses. The Rehabilitation-cum-Restructuring Plan for HDPEL includes assistance of Rs. 21 
crores for implementing a Voluntary Retirement Scheme for the employees. 	
Upon its 
privatisation, the management of the undertaking of HDPEL would not lie with the central 
government. The aforesaid Act has served its purpose and is no longer necessary. The repeal 
of this Act would not have any effect on the management of the firm or in the formation of the 
Joint Venture with a private company. It is further stated that there are no legal issues that 
would impede repeal. 
739. The Bengal Immunity Company Limited (Acquisition and Transfer of 
Aluminium Undertakings) Act, 1984 (57 of 1984) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the acquisition and transfer, in the 
public interest, of the undertakings of Messrs. Bengal Immunity Company Limited, and for

it141. The Swadeshi Cotton Mills Company Limited (Acquisition and 
Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1986 (30 of 1986) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the acquisition and transfer of 
certain textile undertakings of the Swadeshi Cotton Mills Company Limited, with a view to 
securing the proper management of such undertakings so as to subserve the interests of the 
general public by ensuring the continued manufacture, production and distribution of different 
277 
varieties of cloth and yarn and thereby to give effect to the policy of the State towards 
securing the principles specified in clauses (b) and (c) of article 39 of the Constitution and for 
matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Si. No.58 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that the aforesaid Act enabled the acquisition and transfer of 
certain textiles undertakings of the Swadeshi Cotton Mills Company Limited so as to ensure 
the continued manufacture, production and distribution of different varieties of cloth and yarn. 
The management of Swadeshi Cotton Mills was taken over by the central government and the 
National Textile Corporation (NTC) was appointed to manage the affairs of the Mill. The Mill 
was working under the administrative control of the NTC and had been continuously incurring 
losses. Severe financial losses led to the Government of Puducherry extending assistance to 
the Mill. In 2005, the Government of Puducherry took over from the NTC and formed a 
company under the name of Swadeshee-Bharathee Textile Mills Ltd.. The Swadeshi Cotton 
Mill is now working with the active support of the Government of Puducherry and is not 
under the control of the NTC. Swadeshee-Bharathee Textile Mills Ltd is an amalgamation of 
the erstwhile Swadeshi Cotton Mills and Sri Bharathi Mills, which was also a NTC 
undertaking. The aforesaid Act vested the undertakings of the Mills in the NTC. Consequent 
to its takeover by the Government of Puducherry, the NTC does not exercise control the Mill. 
The aforesaid Act thus, no longer serves any purpose. The repeal of the aforesaid Act would 
not affect the management of the Swadeshee-Bharathee Textile Mills Ltd. It further stated that 
there are no legal issues that would impede repeal. 
742. The Brentford Electric (India) Limited (Acquisition and Transfer of 
Undertakings) Act, 1987 (36 of 1987) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide the acquisition and transfer of the

SECTION-2 
CENTRAL ACTS RELATING TO ACQUISITION OF SHARES 
t,..,10\745. The Jayanti Shipping Company (Acquisition of Shares) Act, 1971 
11,1 	
(63 of 1971) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the acquisition of the shares of the 
Jayanti Shipping Company Limited in order to serve better the shipping needs of the nation 
and to facilitate the promotion and development, in the interests of the general public, of 
national shipping and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. The aforesaid 
Act came into force from the 17th day of October, 1971. 
eAt)  
746. The Indian Iron and Steel Company (Acquisition of Shares) Act, 1976 
(89 of 1976) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the acquisition of certain shares of 
the Indian Iron and Steel Company Limited with a view to securing the proper management of 
the affairs of the Company and the continuity and development of the production of goods 
which are vital to the needs of the country and for matters connected therewith or incidental 
thereto. 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at Sl. No. 77 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act without referring consultation with 
the concerned Ministry. The Law Commission observed that the aforesaid the Act provided 
for the acquisition of certain shares of the Indian Iron and Steel Company Limited (IISCO) 
with a view to securing the proper management of the affairs of the Company. By means of 
this Act, all shares of IISCO were transferred to the Central Government and a compensation 
of Rs. 7.2 crores was paid to the shareholders. Pursuant to the acquisition of shares under this 
Act in 1976, the Steel Companies (Restructuring) and Miscellaneous Provisions Act in 1978 
made IISCO a wholly owned subsidiary of the Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL). The 
purpose of the 1976 Act was only the transfer of shares of IISCO to the Central Government 
which has already been fulfilled and hence, the Act is now redundant. The Central 
Government should therefore repeal this Act. A suitable savings clause must be added to the 
repealing Act so as to save any right, privilege, obligation or liability accrued or incurred 
under this Act. The Law Commission also observed that the aforesaid Act was also 
recommended for repeal by the Ministry of Steel in its letter No. 12(45)/2014-SAIL (OP) 
dated 20th August 2014 to the Cabinet Secretariat. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No.44 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that the aforesaid Act provided for the acquisition of shares of the 
Indian Iron and Steel Company Limited (IISCO), for the purpose of ensuring proper 
management of the affairs of the Company. It specified that on an appointed date, all shares of 
this company would be transferred to the central government. Compensation of more than Rs. 
7.2 crores was to be paid to the shareholders, and a Commissioner of Payments was set up for 
this purpose under the Act to decide on claims for payment. Later, under the Steel Companies 
(Restructuring) and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1978, IISCO was made a wholly owned 
subsidiary of the Steel Authority of India (SAIL). IISCO's shares were transferred to SAIL 
279 
under the 1978 Act. In 2006, it was merged with SAIL to try and affect a revival of the 
company. They further stated that the operation of IISCO takes place under the Companies 
Act. The aforesaid Act is therefore not relevant to the functioning of the IISCO and may be 
repealed. It further stated that there are no legal issues that would impede repeal. 
The Ministry of Steel vide their ID No. 170 8)/2014-Coord. dated 15th September, 
2014 to this Committee has stated that there is a possibility of some litigation being sub-
judice before Calcutta High Court or Supreme Court of India. They have further stated that 
savings clause for sustaining the legal consequences and rights arising there from need to be 
provided by Repealing Act. 
In view of the contradiction, the issue of the repeal of the aforesaid Act is 
required to be re-visited in consultation with the Ministry of Steel. 
747. The Caltex [Acquisition of Shares of Caltex Oil Refining (India) 
Limited and of the Undertakings in India of Caltex (India) Limited] Act, 
1977 (17 of 1977) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide, into the public interest, for the 
acquisition of the shares of Caltex Oil Refining (India) Limited and for the acquisition and 
transfer of the right, title and interest of the Caltex (India) Limited in relation to its 
undertakings in India and thereby to secure that the ownership and control of the petroleum 
products produced by the Caltex Oil Refining (India) Limited, and marketed and distributed 
by the said undertakings, in India, are so distributed as best to subserve the common good. 
The Centre for Civil Society at 51. No.49 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that the aforesaid Act provided for the acquisition of all rights, 
titles and interests of the Indian undertakings of Caltex Oil Refining (India) Limited (CORIL) 
by the central government. The purpose of the acquisition was the implementation of the 
policy of progressively securing State ownership and control of the nation's petroleum 
resources. The aforesaid Act gave the power to the central government to transfer these 
holdings to a Government Company. Rs. 13 crores was paid to Caltex Petroleum, the US 
parent company, as compensation. By means of the aforesaid Act, CORIL was merged with 
the Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) in 1977. CORIL now exists as only 
HPCL, which is governed by the Companies Act. Repealing the aforesaid Act will therefore 
not have any effect on the functioning of the company. In 2003, in the case of Centre for 
Public Interest Litigation v. Union of India, the Supreme Court said that the sale of shares of 
HPCL could not take place through executive order, since the formation of HPCL had taken 
place through acquisition statues, including the Caltex [Acquisition of Shares of Caltex Oil 
Refining (India) Limited and of the Undertakings in India of Caltex (India) Limited] Act, 
1977. For the sale of its shares, either Parliamentary approval would have to be obtained, or 
the acquisition statutes, including this one, would have to be repealed. 
748. The Mogul Line Limited (Acquisition of Shares) Act, 1984 (33 of 1984) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to provide, in the public interest, for the acquisition of 
certain shares of the Mogul Line Limited in order to serve better the shipping needs of the 
nation and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.

SECTION-3 
CENTRAL ACTS RELATING TO TAKE OVER OF MANAGEMENT 
749. The Coking Coal Mines (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1971 (64 of 1971). 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the taking over, in the public 
interest, of the management of coking coal mines and coke over plants, pending 
nationalisation of such mines and plants. This Act came into force from the 16th day of 
October, 1971. 
The P.C. Jain Commission in its Report at Sl. No. 137 of Appendix A-1 (166 Central 
Acts recommended for repeal by Central Government) has recommended for repeal of the 
aforesaid Act. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No.40 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that the aforesaid Act was enacted to provide for the temporary 
management of the mines and plants, pending nationalisation. Since the Coal Mines 
(Nationalisation) Act, 1972 came a year later, there remains no use for the previous 
legislation. It further stated that there are no legal issues that would impede repeal. 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th Report at Sl. No. 52 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission, inter alia, observed 
that the aforesaid Act provided for the taking over, in public interest, of the management of 
coking coal mines and coke oven plants, pending nationalisation of such mines and plants. It 
enabled the taking over of private coking companies pending nationalisation. The Coking 
Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act was enacted in 1972. Consequently, the Coking Coal Mines 
(Emergency Provisions) Act, 1971 is now redundant. The Central Government should repeal 
this Act subject to factual verification that this Act has served its purpose. 
750. The Sick Textile Undertakings (Taking Over of Management) Act, 
1972 (72 of 1972) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the taking over, in the public 
interest, of the management of the sick textile undertakings, pending nationalisation of such 
undertakings, for the expeditious rehabilitation of such undertakings so that such rehabilitation 
may subserve the interests of the general public by the augmentation of the production and 
distribution, at fair prices, of cheaper varieties of cloth, and for matters connected therewith or 
incidental thereto. 
The P.C. Jain Commission in its Report at Sl. No. 144 of Appendix A-1 (166 Central 
Acts recommended for repeal by Central Government) has recommended for repeal of the 
aforesaid Act. 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at Sl. No. 55 under Chapter 2 of the

prices, of cheaper varieties of cloth. The nationalisation of the sick textile undertakings was 
carried out by means of the Sick Textile Undertakings (Nationalisation) Act, 1974. Hence, the 
Taking over of Management Act has now served its purpose and the Central Government 
should repeal this Act. A suitable savings clause should be inserted into the repealing Act.

under (i) Loans under Sugar Undertakings (Taking Over of Management) Act, 1978 mills 
which were subsequently taken over by UP State Corporation. The issue of recovery of loan is 
under examination. 
(ii) In respect of another sugar mill of UP the issue of recovery of loan is subludice.

(iv)Repayment claims of a sugar mill in Rajasthan are being reconciled. Since, repayment of 
loans extended to sugar mills under Sugar Undertakings (Taking Over of Management) Act, 
1978 is pending, the Act is not proposed to be repealed at present as it may affect the recovery 
adversely. 
The Committee feels that Legal Opinion may be obtained before the repeal of the Act 
after making a specific savings for the actions taken by the by UP State Corporation and other 
provisions in the repeal Bill.

economy of the country and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No.56 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed inter alia stated that the aforesaid Act was passed to acquire and transfer the 
undertaking of Inchek Tyres Limited and National Rubbers Manufacturers Limited. The 
purpose of the aforesaid Act has been achieved. The process of acquisition was completed in 
1984, and the assets of the Company were vested in the Tyre Corporation of India Limited 
(TCIL), a Government of India enterprise. Subsequently, the Government has decided to dis-
invest 100% equity shareholding in TCIL, pursuant to the TCIL (Disinvestment of 
Ownership) Act, 2007.It is further stated that there are no legal issues that would impede 
repeal. 
764. The Futwah-Islampur Light Railway Line (Nationalisation) Act, 1985 
(83 of 1985) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the acquisition, in the public 
interest, of the undertakings of the Futwah-Islampur Light Railway Company Limited in 
relation to the Futwah-Islampur Light Railway Line and for matters connected therewith or

public and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. After having achieved the 
object for which the aforesaid Act was enacted, the Committee that the aforesaid Act can be 
repealed after making special saving provisions contained in the aforesaid Act. 
286 
PART IV 
CENTRAL ACTS IMPOSING CESS AND IDENTIFIED FOR REPEAL 
766. The Mica Mines Labour Welfare Fund Act, 1946 (XXII of 1946) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to constitute a fund for the financing of activities 
to promote the welfare of labour employed in the mica mining industry. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No.61 of its compendium of 100 laws to be repealed 
inter alia stated that as per the receipt budget of 2013-14, in 2011-12, Rs. 2 crores were 
collected as cess under the aforesaid Act. The estimates for collection in 2013-14 are Rs. 2.34 
crores. The Welfare fund itself has very low balances as indicated in its compendium. 
It further stated that it is likely that as the fund amount travelled towards the 
beneficiaries, further delivery costs are incurred. Even with the Funds previous closing 
balance, the amount left for worker welfare is likely very low (approximately Rs. 1,000 per 
worker per year, assuming that there are about 10,000 registered mica mine workers). In fact, 
the National Commission on Labour itself notes, there is practically no demand for mica now 
because of the substitutes that are available. As of the early 2000s, mica mining has almost 
ended. While the intent of the Act is noteworthy, a requisite allocation should be made as part 
of the budget of Ministry of Labour, instead of the administrative processes of running a fund. 
As 9th Five Year Plan noted, given the large share of those employed in the primary 
industries, outside the organised sector, in very small establishments and at casual status of 
employment, the strategy for benefiting the workforce in general has to be based on an 
increase in productivity rather than on attempting labour welfare through a frame-work of 
multiple regulations. Finally, the mining industry is regulated by the Mines Act, 1952. 
Suitable amendments could be made to this act to include the broad contours of the mining 
welfare provisions under the welfare funds as they stand currently. It further stated that there 
are no legal issue that would impede the repeal of the aforesaid Act. 
The Committee feels that having regard to the amount of the Cess collected under 
the aforesaid Act, the cost of its collection, the number of persons from whom the Cess is 
collected and the potential of increasing the amount of cess under the aforesaid Act and 
simplification by abolishing the aforesaid Cess, it is suggested that alternate sources of 
funding by executive measures for the welfare of the workers and simplification of the 
law, consider the repeal of the provisions relating to levy of cess under the aforesaid Act 
and making consequential amendments in the aforesaid Act. 
767. The Rubber Act, 1947 (24 of 1947) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the development under central 
control of the rubber industry so far as regards the production and marketing of rubber, and for 
regulating the export from, and import into, British India of rubber. 
The Committee feels that having regard to the amount of the Cess collected under 
the aforesaid Act, the cost of its collection, the number of persons from whom the Cess is 
collected and the potential of increasing the amount of cess under the aforesaid Act and 
simplification by abolishing the aforesaid Cess, it is suggested that alternate sources of 
funding by executive measures for the welfare of the workers and simplification of the 
law, consider the repeal of the provisions relating to levy of cess under the aforesaid Act 
and making consequential amendments in the aforesaid Act. 
287 
768. The Tea Act, 1953 (29 of 1953) 
An Act to provide for the control by the Union of the tea industry, including the 
control, in pursuance of the International Agreement now in force, of the cultivation of tea in, 
and of the export of tea from, India and for that purpose to establish a Tea Board and Levy a 
duty of excise on tea produced in India. 
The Committee feels that having regard to the amount of the Cess collected under 
the aforesaid Act, the cost of its collection, the number of persons from whom the Cess is 
collected and the potential of increasing the amount of cess under the aforesaid Act and 
simplification by abolishing the aforesaid Cess, it is suggested that alternate sources of 
funding by executive measures for the welfare of the workers and simplification of the 
law, consider the repeal of the provisions relating to levy of cess under the aforesaid Act 
and making consequential amendments in the aforesaid Act and not the provisions 
relating to welfare fund. 
769. The Salt Cess Act, 1953 (49 of 1953) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the levy and collection of a cess on 
salt for the purpose of raising funds to meet the expenses incurred on the salt organisation 
maintained by Government and on the measures taken by Government in connection with the 
manufacture, supply and distribution of salt. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No.33 of its compendium of 100 laws to be repealed 
inter alia stated that the High Level Salt Enquiry Committee (1978) recommended that the 
cess be removed, since the annual collection was very small while the total annual cost of 
administering it licensing of salt works and controlling the release of salt was 55% of the total 
cess collected, at that time. Currently, the costs of administration far exceed the collected cess. 
In 2012-13, cess receipts amounted to Rs. 348.99 laths, or 14% of the Salt Department's 
expenditure on administration and labour welfare, which amounted to Rs. 2,611.80 laths. 
Given that collections are so low, abolition of the cess will not affect fund flow for 
Government of India significantly. It further stated that the Customs, Excise and Gold 
Tribunal in 1990 observed that "for all practical purposes, as an excisable commodity, [salt] is 
a non-existent item", as the amounts collected are negligible. Earmarked taxes such as this 
cess are inefficient since they introduce distortions, lead to budgetary indiscipline, and 
typically have excessive administration and compliance costs. 
The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion vide their D.0 No.34011/13/2014- 
OSM 19th September, 2014 has stated that the aforesaid Act has not been repealed. They 
further stated that the Expenditure reforms Commission (ERC) recommended in September, 
2001 that Cess on salt may be collected either by the Central Excise Department or it may be 
abolished. The recommendation has not been accepted. The administrative Ministry is moving 
a Cabinet Note to reverse the above recommendation of ERC. 
The Committee feels that having regard to the amount of the Cess collected under 
the aforesaid Act, the cost of its collection, the number of persons from whom the Cess is 
collected and the potential of increasing the amount of cess under the aforesaid Act and 
simplification by abolishing the aforesaid Cess, it is suggested that alternate sources of 
288 
funding by executive measures for the welfare of the workers and simplification of the 
law, consider the repeal of the aforesaid Act. 
770. The Limestone and Dolomite Mines Labour Welfare Fund Act, 1972 
(62 of 1972) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the levy and collection of a cess on 
limestone and dolomite for the financing of activities to promote the welfare of persons 
employed in the limestone and dolomite mines. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No.62 of its compendium of 100 laws to be repealed 
inter alia stated that as per the Receipt Budget of 2013-14, in 2011-12, only Rs. 12 crores were 
collected as cess under the aforesaid Act. The estimates for collection in 2013-14 are Rs. 
14.78 crores. As has been observed, laws pertaining to labour welfare cesses create a low-
level equilibrium, where their costs far outweigh their benefits. This mechanism has resulted 
in administrative inefficiency, particularly very high transaction costs and costs of maintaining 
records. Cesses collected are inadequate, and the amount ultimately available for worker 
welfare is negligible. The needs for which the cess is collected can instead be met by funds 
from the Consolidated Fund of India. This would also reduce administrative costs for the 
government, and help direct administrative resources towards other purposes. We have argued 
before that earmarked cesses are inefficient and ineffective public finance. In keeping with the 
principles of sound public finance and administration, such welfare cesses must be done away 
with. It has been further stated that there are no legal issues that would impede repeal. 
The Committee feels that having regard to the amount of the Ccss collected under 
the aforesaid Act, the cost of its collection, the number of persons from whom the Ccss is 
collected and the potential of increasing the amount of cess under the aforesaid Act and 
simplification by abolishing the aforesaid Cess, it is suggested that alternate sources of 
funding by executive measures for the welfare of the workers and simplification of the 
law, consider the repeal of the provisions relating to levy of cess under the aforesaid Act 
and making consequential amendments in the aforesaid Act. 
771. The Tobacco Cess Act, 1975 (26 of 1975) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the levy and collection, by way of 
cess, of a duty of excise on Virginia tobacco and a duty of customs on tobacco, for the 
development of tobacco industry and for matters connected therewith. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No.35 of its compendium of 100 laws to be repealed 
inter alia stated that In 2006, the Cess Laws (Repealing and Amending) Act removed a 
number of cesses on agricultural products (like the Agricultural Produce Cess Act and the 
Spices Cess Act) to increase the competitiveness of our agricultural exports. The Tobacco 
Cess Act was also considered in this process and section 4 of this Act, which dealt with the 
levy of customs duty on tobacco exports, was repealed. The excise duty on tobacco under 
Section 3 of this Act, however, still operates. The cess collected is negligible. 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at 51. No. 58 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission, inter alia, observed 
that the aforesaid Act The Act provided for the levy and collection, by way of a cess, of a 
duty of excise on Virginia tobacco and a duty of customs on tobacco, for the development of 
289 
the tobacco industry. The Act imposes a duty of excise at the rate of one paisa per kilogram on 
Virginia tobacco which is produced in India. However, the objective of revenue generation for 
the development of the tobacco industry is not met through the proceeds of the cess which are 
negligible compared to the amount spent in the administration of the cess. In 2003-04, the cess 
collected under the Act was only Rs. 13,94,000. Therefore, the Central Government should 
repeal this Act. 
The Committee feels that having regard to the amount of the Cess collected under 
the aforesaid Act, the cost of its collection, the number of persons from whom the Cess is 
collected and the potential of increasing the amount of cess under the aforesaid Act and 
simplification by abolishing the aforesaid Cess, it is suggested that alternate sources of 
funding by executive measures for the welfare of the workers and simplification of the 
law, consider the repeal of the aforesaid Act. 
772. The Iron Ore Mines, Manganese Ore Mines and Chrome Ore Mines 
Labour Welfare Cess Act, 1976 (55 of 1976) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the levy and collection of a cess on 
iron ore, manganese ore and Chrome Ore for the financing of activities to promote the welfare 
of persons employed in the iron ore mines, manganese ore mines and chrome ore mines and 
for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No.63 of its compendium of 100 laws to be repealed 
inter alia stated that the Receipt Budget of 2013-14, in 2011-12, only Rs. 12 crores were 
collected as cess under the Act. The estimates for collection in 2013-14 are Rs. 14.78 crores. 
As has been observed, laws pertaining to labour welfare cesses create a low-level equilibrium, 
where their costs far outweigh their benefits. This mechanism has resulted in administrative 
inefficiency, particularly very high transaction costs and costs of maintaining records. Cesses 
collected are inadequate, and the amount ultimately available for worker welfare is negligible. 
The needs for which the cess is collected can instead be met by funds from the Consolidated 
Fund of India. This would also reduce administrative costs for the government, and help direct 
administrative resources towards other purposes. We have argued before that earmarked 
cesses are inefficient and ineffective public finance. In keeping with the principles of sound 
public finance and administration, such welfare cesses must be done away with. 
The Committee feels that having regard to the amount of the Cess collected under • 
the aforesaid Act, the cost of its collection, the number of persons from whom the Cess is 
collected and the potential of increasing the amount of cess under the aforesaid Act and 
simplification by abolishing the aforesaid Cess, it is suggested that alternate sources of 
funding by executive measures for the welfare of the workers and simplification of the 
law, consider repeal of the provisions relating to levy of cess under the aforesaid Act and 
making consequential amendments in the aforesaid Act. 
773. The Beedi Workers Labour Welfare Cess Act, 1976 (56 of 1976) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the levy and collection, by way of 
cess, a duty of excise on manufactured beedies. 
The Centre for Civil Society at S1. No.65 of its compendium of 100 laws to be repealed 
inter alia stated that as per the Receipt Budget of 2013-14, in 2011-12, only Rs. 150 crores 
290 
were collected as cess under the Act. The estimates for collection in 2013-14 are Rs. 160 
crores. India has over 4 million beedi workers, most of whom are home based, and therefore 
in the unorganised sector. The amount collected as cess is inadequate to meaningfully provide 
welfare measures for such vast numbers. The cess collection merely adds to administrative 
costs. The needs for which the cess is collected can instead be met by funds from the 
Consolidated Fund of India. This would also reduce administrative costs for the government, 
and help direct administrative resources towards other purposes. In keeping with the principles 
of sound public finance and administration, such welfare cesses must be done away with. The 
Beedi Workers Welfare Cess is one of the small cesses that brings in negligible amounts of 
money even as it adds to the administrative costs for the Government. The repeal of this Act 
would not entail severe consequences for the revenue collected. Aside from this, there are no 
legal issues that would impede repeal. 
The Committee feels that having regard to the amount of the Cess collected under 
the aforesaid Act, the cost of its collection, the number of persons from whom the Cess is 
collected and the potential of increasing the amount of cess under the aforesaid Act and 
simplification by abolishing the aforesaid Cess, it is suggested that alternate sources of 
funding by executive measures for the welfare of the workers and simplification of the 
law, consider the repeal of the aforesaid Act. 
774. The Cine-workers Labour Welfare Cess Act, 1981 
(30 of 1981) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the levy and collection of a cess on 
feature films for the financing of activities to promote the welfare of certain cine-workers and 
for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No.67 of its compendium of 100 laws to be repealed 
inter alia stated that As per the Receipt Budget of 2013-14, in 2011-12, only Rs. 1.5 crores 
were collected as cess under the Act. The estimates for collection in 2013-14 are Rs. 1.78 
crores. Scrutiny of accounts of the Ministry of Labour and Employment revealed that the cess 
collected under this Act was not fully transferred to the Fund. In 2011-12, there was shortfall 
of approximately Rs. 0.81 crores and the same was not accounted for. The cess collected is 
inadequate and merely adds to administrative costs. The needs for which the cess is collected 
can instead be met by funds from the Consolidated Fund of India. This would prevent the 
huge administrative costs that go into collection of this cess. We have argued before that 
earmarked cesses are inefficient and ineffective public finance. In keeping with the principles 
of sound public finance and administration, such welfare cesses must be done away with. It 
further stated that the Cine Workers Welfare Cess is one of the small cesses that brings in 
negligible amounts of money even as it adds to the administrative costs for the Government. 
The repeal of this Act would not entail severe consequences for the revenue collected. Aside 
from this, there are no legal issues that would impede repeal. 
The Committee feels that having regard to the amount of the Cess collected under 
the aforesaid Act, the cost of its collection, the number of persons from whom the Cess is 
collected and the potential of increasing the amount of cess under the aforesaid Act and 
simplification by abolishing the aforesaid Cess, it is suggested that alternate sources of 
funding by executive measures for the welfare of the workers and simplification of the 
law, consider the repeal of the aforesaid Act levying Cess. 
291 
775. The Sugar Cess Act, 1982 (3 of 1982) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the imposition of a cess on sugar for 
the development of sugar industry and for matters connected therewith. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Si. No.36 of its compendium of 100 laws to be repealed 
inter alia stated that between 1982-83 and 2008-09 the average cess collected per year was Rs. 
207 crores, of which an average of Rs. 163 crores was transferred to the SDF. In 2008, the 
government estimated that the SDF would not have sufficient funds after March 2009 to meet 
the expected expenditure on financial assistance. The cess collected is therefore inadequate to 
meet the costs of the SDF. It has been further stated that in the past, where cesses have been 
abolished, the costs of the relevant Board have been met through government grants. The 
Spices Board, for example, which used to receive the realisations from the spices cess, is now 
operating on goverment budget outlays. A similar solution can be introduced for the SDF. 
Earmarked taxes such as this cess are inefficient since they introduce distortions, lead to 
budgetary indiscipline, and typically have excessive administration and compliance costs. 
The Committee feels that having regard to the amount of the Cess collected under 
the aforesaid Act, the cost of its collection, the number of persons from whom the Cess is 
collected and the potential of increasing the amount of cess under the aforesaid Act and 
simplification by abolishing the aforesaid Cess, it is suggested that alternate sources of 
funding by executive measures for the welfare of the workers and simplification of the 
law, consider the repeal of the aforesaid Act. 
776. The Jute Manufactures Cess Act, 1983 (28 of 1983) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the levy and collection, by way of 
cess, of a duty of excise on jute manufactures for the purpose of carrying out measures for the 
development of production of jute manufactures and for matters connected therewith. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No.37 of its compendium of 100 laws to be repealed 
inter alia stated that the amounts collected under the cess are negligible, and only about half 
are transferred to the National Jute Board. In 2011-12, cess collected was Rs. 85 crores while 
the transfer to the Board only amounted to Rs. 34 crores. The Special Economic Zones Act, 
2005 exempts goods in an SEZ from this cess. While this is not in itself a ground for repeal, 
perhaps it is an indication that this cess is a hindrance to economic activity and should not 
operate anywhere else in the country. In the past, where cesses have been abolished, the costs 
of the relevant Board have been met through government grants. The Spices Board, for 
example, which used to receive the realisations from the spices cess, is now operating on 
government budget outlays. A similar solution can be introduced for the National Jute Board. 
Earmarked taxes such as this cess are inefficient since they introduce distortions, lead to 
budgetary indiscipline, and typically have excessive administration and compliance costs. 
The Committee feels that having regard to the amount of the Cess collected under 
the aforesaid Act, the cost of its collection, the number of persons from whom the Cess is 
collected and the potential of increasing the amount of cess under the aforesaid Act and 
simplification by abolishing the aforesaid Cess, it is suggested that alternate sources of 
funding by executive measures for the welfare of the workers and simplification of the 
law, consider the repeal of the aforesaid Act levying Cess. 
292 
777. The Research and Development Cess Act, 1986 (32 of 1986) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the levy and collection of a cess on 
all payments made for the import of technology for the purposes of encouraging the 
commercial application of indigenously developed technology and for adapting imported 
technology to wider domestic application and for matters connected therewith or incidental 
thereto. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Si. No.38 of its compendium of 100 laws to be repealed 
inter alia stated that the cess hinders the flow of technology into the nation and poses a barrier 
to trade. The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry complained about the tax in 
2002 and characterised the Act as a hindrance and there are reports of industry complaints that 
the applications of this Act arc discretionary and often ad hoc, leading to harassment. There is 
also lack of clarity on whether this cess and service tax amount to double taxation. The cess 
collected is too small to justify the restrictions caused by its imposition. In the I3-year period 
between 1997 and 2010, only Rs. 2,261 crores were collected under the Act. Of this, only 22% 
or Rs. 501 crores (or Rs. 36 crores annually) were channelled to the Technology Development 
Board during this period. This is a small amount that can easily be compensated, while 
achieving savings in administrative costs of the cess collection. Earmarked taxes such as this 
cess are inefficient since they introduce distortions, lead to budgetary indiscipline, and 
typically have excessive administration and compliance costs. 
The Committee feels that having regard to the amount of the Cess collected under 
the aforesaid Act, the cost of its collection, the number of persons from whom the Cess is 
collected and the potential of increasing the amount of cess under the aforesaid Act and 
simplification by abolishing the aforesaid Cess, it is suggested that alternate sources of 
funding by executive measures for the welfare of the workers and simplification of the 
law, consider the repeal of the aforesaid Act levying Cess. 
In case any Central Act has provision for levy of Cess and inadvertently not included under 
this Part, such Central Acts may also be considered for repeal by the concerned Ministry/Department. 
293 
CHAPTER-5 
CENTRAL ACTS TO BE REPEALED BY 
STATE LEGISLATURES 
The 20th Law Commission in paragraph 4.4 under Chapter- IV of its 248th  Report 
have stated that based on the reading of article 372(1), it is clear that if the subject-matter of a 
pre-constitutional law falls into the State List, the State Government is the competent 
legislature to repeal that Act. As a result, where it is appropriate to refer a Statute to the 
concerned State Government for repeal, the same has been indicated in the notes 
accompanying the Statute recommended for repeal. 
2. 	
Attention is invited to paragraph 16.4.9 of the Report of the P.C. Jain Commission, 
which reads as under:— 
"The scheme for legislation in India is, inter-alia, based on the dictum that a Statute never dies unless 
specifically repealed. This has resulted in a situation where Statutes which are even more than 100 years 
old, as also the Statutes which were enacted for a temporary purpose/period have continued to exist in the 
Statute Books. More often than not, resort is made to amending the Statutes than enacting a fresh updated 
legislation. The Commission is therefore, of the view that a time has come when the Government should 
seriously consider whether a sunset provision, as in the USA, be followed in our legislative practice also.". 
2.1. 
It is established legislative practice that a Statute never dies (whether excluded from 
the list of existing Statutes or not) unless it is repealed by the competent legislature. Removal 
of the title of a Central Act from the Statutes Book can be construed that the status of a 
Central Act as non existing or repealed Act and may create a confusion in the minds of the 
public/stake holders about status of such Central Act. Therefore, the Committee feels that the 
such Central Acts which have become obsolete, redundant or inoperative and continue to exist 
on the Statutes Book should be repealed by the competent Legislatures. 
3. 	
Attention is invited to clause (7) of section 3 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 which 
reads as under:— 
"(7) 'Central Act' shall mean an Act of Parliament, and shall include— 
(a) an Act of the Dominion Legislature or of the Indian Legislature passed before the 
commencement of the Constitution, and 
(b) an Act made before such commencement by the Governor General in Council or the 
Governor General, acting in a legislative capacity.". 
294 
3.1. 	
Attention is also invited to article 367 of the Constitution which, inter alia, reads 
under:- 
"367. Interpretation.—(1) Unless the context otherwise requires, the General Clauses Act, 1897, shall, 
subject to any adaptation and modifications that may be made therein under article 372, apply for the 
interpretation of this Constitution as it applies for the interpretation of an Act of Legislature of the 
Dominion of India. 
(2) Any reference in this Constitution to Acts or laws of, or made by, Parliament, or to Acts or laws 
of, or made by, the Legislature of a State, shall be construed as including a reference to an Ordinance 
made by the President or, to an Ordinance made by a Governor, as the case may be.". 
4. 	
The P.C. Jain Commission in its Report at paragraph 16.4.7 inter alia, stated as under:- 
"16.4.7.----Regarding the Acts pertaining to a State subject, Government should circulate a list to 
all State Governments requesting them to examine whether they are in force in the State or part 
thereof, and if they are not being implemented, the State Governments may consider their repeal 
If the above is done, we would have gone a long way in "excising the dead wood from the Statute 
Book". 
5. 
The P.C. Jain Commission in its Report at Appendix A-5 thereto has given the list of 
114 Central Acts relating to State subjects for repeal by the State Governments. 
6. 
The Law Commission in its 248th Report under Chapter 4 observed as under:— 
"4.2. One related question has been considered with respect to each statute studied — Which is the 
appropriate legislating body for repeal of these laws? This question is particularly relevant for pre-
independence laws passed by the Governor-General in Council, the subject matter of which now 
falls in the State list. The answer to this question has been determined with reference to Article 
3720) of the Constitution which says that pre-independence laws continue to remain in force unless 
amended or repealed by a competent legislature. Competent legislature in the Constitutional scheme 
refers to the legislating body that has the power to make laws on a particular matter under Article 
246 read with the Seventh Schedule. This has been explained in Kerala State Electricity Board v. 
The Indian Aluminium Co. Ltd. [AIR 1976 SC 1031], which stated: 
An existing law continues to be valid even though the legislative power with respect to the subject-
matter of the existing law might be in a different list under the Constitution from the list under 
which it would have fallen under the Government of India Act, 1935. But after the Constitution 
came into force an existing law could be amended or repealed only by the legislature which would 
be competent to enact that law if it were to be newly enacted. 
4.3. Similarly, in Kanwar Lal v. Lind Additional Distt. Judge, Nainital, [AIR 1995 SC 2078], the 
Supreme Court while considering amendments to the Government Grants Act, 1895, (a pre-
constitutional Central Statute) held that the State Government was the competent legislature to 
amend or repeal this Act, since the subject matter of the Act fell into Entry 18 of List II. 
4.4. Based on this reading of Article 372(1), it is clear that if the subject-matter of a pre-
constitutional law falls into the State List, the State Government is the competent legislature to 
repeal that Act. As a result, where it is appropriate to refer a statute to the concerned State 
Government for repeal, the same has been indicated in the notes accompanying the statute 
recommended for repeal.". 
295 
7. 
Attention is drawn to the 
repealed by the State Legislatures, 
1986 (56 of 1986) was repealed by 
and the Punjab Appropriation (Vote 
Punjab Act 20 of 1952. 
legislative precedents wherein the Central Acts were 
such as the Delhi Fire Prevention and Fire Safety Act, 
the Delhi Fire Service Act, 2007 (Delhi Act 2 of 2009) 
on Account) Act 1952(16 of 1952) has been repealed by 
8. 
On the basis of the aforesaid legal position stated at paragraphs 3 to 7 above, the 
Central Acts relating to State subjects are to be repealed by the concerned State Legislatures 
and such Central Acts (falling under State subjects) are indicated under this Chapter and 
Chapter-7 (State Appropriation Acts enacted by Parliament). The Committee suggests that in 
case any doubt arises on the legislative competence for repeal of a Central Acts mentioned 
under this Chapter and Chapter-7, the Legal opinion from the Department of Legal Affairs, 
Ministry of Law and Justice or the Law Officer, as may be considered appropriate, may be 
obtained and needful be done accordingly for repeal of such Central Acts. 
9. 
The P.C. Jain Commission in its Report has recommended in 1998, 114 Central Acts 
relating to State subjects for repeal by the State Governments [Refer Volume IV Part-I]. The 
Legislative Department vide their U.O. No. 11 (29)/2014-L.I dated 26/9/14 [Refer Volume 
Part-II (Pages 425 to 439] has, inter alia, intimated that 108 such Acts have not been 
repealed so far. 
10. 
In view of the preceding paragraphs, the Committee suggests that Legal Opinion may 
be obtained from the Department of Legal Affairs, Ministry of Law and Justice or the Law 
Officer, as may be considered appropriate, as to whether the Parliament can be conferred 
legislative competence by Resolution passed by the concerned State Legislature or by the 
consent of the concerned State Governments or in any other way in respect of such Central 
Acts identified for repeal. 
11. 
On perusal of the Central Acts from the year beginning from 1834 to October, 2014, 
the following Central Acts relating to State subjects have been identified for repeal by the 
State Legislatures, namely:— 
296 
1. The Bengal Indigo Contracts Act, 1836 (X of 1836) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to settle the disputes relating to right to Indigo 
plant. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Right Hon'ble the Governor General of India in 
Council on the 11th April, 1836. 
The aforesaid Act, inter alia, provides that the Court tries any suit instituted under the 
provisions of Regulations VI of the Bengal Code or under the provisions of the aforesaid Act 
shall be authorised to examine both the plaintiff and defendant, whenever the court shall 
deems such examination necessary to the ends of justice. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for its repeal at Sl. No. 13 of 
Annexure-A-S to its Report (114 Central Acts relating to State subjects for repeal by State 
Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at Si. No. 1 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act in consultation with relevant 
State(s) referring to the earlier recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. It has 
observed that prior to independence, the British controlled the entire trade in indigo and this 
Act, which was enacted by the Governor-General-in-Council, helped consolidate British rule 
over indigo farming by enforcing its cultivation by farmers in the erstwhile Bengal province. 
This Act is in disuse and a remnant of colonialism, and should be repealed. However, 
according to Article 3720), the competent legislature for repeal of this Act is that of the State 
where the Act is in force. Therefore, the Central Government should write to the concerned 
State Governments recommending review of this law by the State with a view to repeal. The 
Central Government should also remove this law from its lists of Central Acts in force. 
By efflux of time. the aforesaid Act has become redundant and needs to be repealed. 
In view of the position stated at paragraphs 3 to 9 above, the Committee feels 
that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
2. The Bengal Districts Act, 1836 (XXI of 1836) 
The aforesaid Act has been passed by the Right Hon'ble the Governor General of 
India in Council on the 19th September, 1836. The aforesaid Act was enacted to empower the 
Governor General in Council to create new Zillahs in any part of the Presidency of Fort 
Williams in Bengal and to alter the limits of existing Zillahs. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for its repeal at serial No. 10 of 
Annexure-A-5 to its Report (114 Central Acts relating to State subjects for repeal by State 
Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th  Report at serial No. 1 under Chapter 4 has 
recommended to the State of West Bengal for the repeal of the aforesaid Act with suitable 
amedments. The Law Commission has observed that the aforesaid Act gives power to the 
State Government in Bengal to create new districts by notification in the Official Gazette and 
it is one of two of the oldest laws in the statute books. The Commission further observed that 
while new districts are now formed by State Governments under their respective Revenue 
Codes, Bengal is a special case where it is still being done under the Central Act. This law 
may be repealed if the power to create districts is instead included in the relevant West 
Bengal statute. 
By efflux of time and in view of the position stated at paragraphs 3 to 9 above, 
297 
the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be considered for repeal. 
3. The Madras Public Property Malverisation Act, 1837 (XXXVI of 1837) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted for extension of jurisdiction of Collectors and 
their subordinates in cases of embezzlement, etc., to similar offences by persons of certain 
classes and for extension of enactments relating to embezzlement. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for its repeal at serial No.62 of 
Annexure-A-5 to its Report (114 Central Acts relating to State subjects for repeal by State 
Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at SI. No. 2 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act in consultation with relevant 
State(s) referring to the earlier recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law 
Commission observed that the aforesaid Act extended the jurisdiction of the Collectors, 
Subordinate Collectors and Assistant Collectors to cases of embezzlement of any public 
property or the falsification, destruction or concealment of any public account, record, 
voucher or document, relating to any public property. It is in force in the State of Tamil 
Nadu. Although enacted by the Governor-General-in-Council prior to independence, it is now 
administered by the relevant State which also has the power to repeal or amend this law. 
Therefore, the Central Government should write to the concerned State Government seeking 
its opinion in regard to this law. Thereafter, the Central Government should also remove this 
law from its lists of central Acts in force. 
By efflux of time and in view of the position stated at paragraphs 3 to 9 above, 
the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be considered for repeal. 
4. The Bengal Bonded Warehouse Association Act, 1838 (V of 1838) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to form a corporate body for the Warehousing of 
Good, either in bond or otherwise, by the name of the Bengal Bonded Warehouse 
Association. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for its repeal at serial No.7 of 
Annexure-A-5 to its Report (114 Central Acts relating to State subjects for repeal by State 
Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th  Report at serial No. 2 under Chapter 4 has 
recommended for the repeal of the aforesaid Act and observed that the aforesaid Act was 
enacted to stipulate that only residents of the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal can be the 
directors of the Bengal Bonded Warehouse Association and that the Association can sell its 
property only to the East India Company. The Commission further observed that the East 
India Company is no longer in existence, and the Presidency of Fort William has also ceased 
to exist as an administrative unit and consequently, the Act is now redundant. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has recommended for its repeal at SI.No.7 of Annexure-A-
5 to its Report (114 Central Acts relating to State subjects for repeal by State Governments) 
and the Law Commission has recommended the repeal of the aforesaid Act without 
mentioning the requirement of consultation with the relevant State. 
Since the aforesaid Act has been enacted to form a corporate body for the 
Warehousing of Good, either in bond or otherwise, by the name of the Bengal Bonded 
Warehouse Association, therefore, the aforesaid Act has been included in this Chapter. 
By efflux of time and in view of the position stated at paragraphs 3 to 9 above, 
the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be considered for repeal. 
298 
5. The Madras Rent and Revenue Sales Act, 1839 (VII of 1839) 
The copy of the aforesaid Act is not available in the Central Acts (Master Copy set 
No. 29) made available to the Committee by the Legislative Department. The Legislative 
Department has vide their O.M. No. 1 (2)/2014-Corr. dated 18th September, 2014 (See 
Volume III, Part-II (Pages 404 to 419) has intimated that the aforesaid Act copy is not 
available with them also. The aforesaid Act is also not available on the Indiacode.nic.in 
 
being the website of the Legislative Department. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for its repeal at Sl.No.63 of 
Annexure-A-5 to its Report (114 Central Acts relating to State subjects for repeal by State 
Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at 51. No. 3 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act in consultation with relevant 
State(s) referring to the earlier recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law 
Commission observed that the aforesaid Act laid down the powers of the Tahsildar with 
respect to property distrained for arrears of rent or revenue. It is in force in the State of Tamil 
Nadu. Although enacted by the Governor-General-in-Council prior to independence, it is now 
administered by the relevant State which also has the power to repeal or amend this law. 
Therefore, the Central Government should write to the concern 	
State The 
Government 
ral 
recommending review of this law by the State, with a view toedepeal. C 
Government should also remove this law from its lists of central Acts in force. 
The Committee did not have occasion to study the aforesaid Act due to non-
availability of the text of the aforesaid Act as mentioned above and therefore unable to 
give its views on the aforesaid Act. In view of the above, the Legislative Department 
may take a view in the matter for repeal of the aforesaid Act. 
6. The Bengal Land Revenue Sales Act, 1841 (XII of 1841) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to amend the Bengal Code relating to sales of 
land for arrears of Revenue. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Right I-1011131e the Governor 
General of India in Council on the 19th July, 1841. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for its repeal at SI.No.15 of 
Annexure-A-S to its Report (114 Central Acts relating to State subjects for repeal by State 
Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at Sl. No. 4 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act in consultation with relevant State(s) 
referring to the earlier recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission 
has observed that the text of this Act is not available on the Law Ministry's website, or from 
any other readily available source, an indication that it is not in use. Neither are there any 
other documented instances where this Act has been used in the last few decades. This Act 
should therefore be repealed. Since land revenue falls under List II of the Seventh Schedule 
(Entry 45), the State legislature is the competent legislature for repeal of this Act. Therefore, 
the Central Government should write to the concerned State Government recommending 
review of this law by the State, with a view to repeal. The Central Government should also 
remove this law from its lists of Central Acts in force. 
The Committee on perusal of the aforesaid Act under the Central Acts bound volume 
1842 to 1845 made available to the Committee is of the view that the aforesaid Act has 
become redundant in view of Revenue Recovery Act, 1890 which was enacted subsequent to 
the enactment of the Bengal Land Revenue Sales Act, 1841. 
By efflux of time and in view of the position stated at paragraphs 3 to 9 above, 
299 
the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be considered for repeal. 
7. Sales of Land for Revenue Arrears (I of 1845) 
The aforesaid Act has been passed by the Right Honble the Governor General in 
Council on the 19th July, 1841. The aforesaid Act was enacted to amend the Bengal Land 
Revenue Sales Act, 1841 (XII of 1841). The Bengal Land Revenue Sales Act, 1841 was 
enacted to amend the Bengal Code relating to sales of land for arrears of Revenue. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for its repeal at SI. No. 87 of 
Annexure-A-5 to its Report (114 Central Acts relating to State subjects for repeal by State 
Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at SI. No. 7 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act in consultation with relevant 
State(s) referring to the earlier recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law 
Commission observed that this is another law whose text is not readily available. Neither are 
there any other indications that the Act is in use. However, according to Article 372(1), the 
competent legislature for repeal of this Act is that of the State where the Act is in force. 
Therefore, the Central Government should write to the concerned State Governments 
recommending the review of this law by the State, with a view to repeal. The Central 
Government should also remove this law from its lists of central Acts in force. 
The Committee feels that the Bengal Land Revenue Sales Act, 1841 itself has become 
redundant in view of Revenue Recovery Act, 1890. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act has been shown as 
repealed in the Status of Acts prepared by it and given under Volume II which may be 
revisited and can be considered for repeal in the light of Legal Opinion and 
consultation with the relevant State Governments and Legislative Department. 
8. Boundary-marks, Bombay (III of 1846) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted for the establishment and maintenance of field 
boundary marks in the Presidency of Bombay. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Hon'ble 
the President of the Council of India in Council on the 7th January, 1846, with the assent of 
the Right Hon'ble the Governor General of India. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for its repeal at SI. No.28 of 
Annexure-A-5 to its Report (114 Central Acts relating to State subjects for repeal by State 
Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at SI. No. 8 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act in consultation with relevant 
State(s) referring to the earlier recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law 
Commission observed that this is another law whose text is not readily available. Neither are 
there any other indications that the Act is in use. However, according to Article 372(1), the 
competent legislature for repeal of this Act is that of the State where the Act is in force. 
Therefore, the Central Government should write to the concerned State Government 
recommending the review of this law by the State, with a view to repeal. The Central 
Government should also remove this law from its lists of central Acts in force. 
The aforesaid Act has been repealed by in part by Act No. 16 of 1874, Bombay Act 1 
of 1865 and Bombay Act 5 of 1879 (repealed locally) and therefore a view has to be taken as 
to whether the aforesaid Act deemed to have been repealed or it exists on the Central Statutes 
and required to be repealed. 	
It requires to be re-visited to ascertain as to whether the 
Boundaries covered by the aforesaid Act are confined to one State or more than one State. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be considered 
for repeal in the light of Legal Opinion and consultation with the relevant State 
300 
Governments and Legislative Department. 
9. Boundaries (I of 1847) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted for the establishment and maintenance of 
boundary marks in the North Western Provinces of Bengal. The aforesaid Act was passed 
by the Hon'ble the President of the Council of India in Council on the 30th January, 1847,

The Law Commission of India in its 248th  report at Si. No. 4 under Chapter 4 of the 
Report observed that the aforesaid Act was enacted for the forfeiture to the Government of 
deposits made on incomplete sales of land made under Regulation VIII, 1819 of the Bengal

taking fraudulent advantage of this Regulation, this Act was introduced to counter the

drains or tanks for the prevention of nuisances or for improving the town. Municipal 
regulations and urban local bodies of respective States adequately cover these matters now. 
However, according to Article 372(1), the competent legislature for repeal of this Act is that 
of the State where the Act is in force (`local government' is Item 5 in List II of the Seventh 
Schedule). Therefore, the Central Government should write to the concerned State 
Governments recommending the review of this law by the State, with a view to repeal. The 
Central Government should also remove this law from its lists of central Acts in force. 
303 
The aforesaid Act extended the local self government to the whole country and

decrees of rent. The Act vested jurisdiction in the Collector to conduct the sale, or to hear and 
decide the suit with respect to land which is the subject of such sale. Most States have now 
enacted their own rent recovery laws. Hence, the purpose of this Act has been subsumed by 
other laws. However, since the competent legislature for the subject of procedure in rent 
courts is that of the State, (See Item 3, List II, Seventh Schedule, Constitution of India), based 
on Article 3720) of the Constitution, the repeal of this Act can only be done by the relevant 
States where it is still in operation. 
Almost all the States have enacted their Rent Control Acts in their respective States. 
The aforesaid Act has become obsolete and needs to be repealed. 
By efflux of time and in view of the position stated at paragraphs 3 to 9 above,

close vicinity of these areas. The management of hazardous waste materials is now carried 
out under various rules framed under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the Water

aforesaid Act is amendment Act to that Act also needs to be repealed.

The aforesaid Act has become irrelevant and obsolete in the present day scenario. 
By efflux of time and in view of the position stated at paragraphs 3 to 9 above, 
the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be considered for repeal. 
29. The Bengal Ghatwali Lands Act, 1859 (V of 1859) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to empower the holders of Ghatwali lands in the 
District of Beerbhoom to grant lease extending beyond the period of their own possession. 
The aforesaid Act was passed by the Legislative Council of India and received the assent of 
the Governor General on the 4th March, 1859. 
309 
The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for its repeal at SI. No.12 of 
Annexure A-5 of its Report (114 central Acts to be repealed by the State Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at Sl. No. 23 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. The Law Commission observed 
that the aforesaid Act empowered the holders of ghatwali lands in the district of Birbhum in 
West Bengal to grant leases extending beyond the period of their own possession. The Act 
was enacted specifically for the benefit of ghatwals who paid the revenue of their lands 
directly to the Government under Regulation 29, 1814 of the Bengal Code. This system of 
land revenue administration no longer exists. However, the power to repeal or amend this law 
rests with the concerned State legislature. Therefore, the Central Government should write to 
the concerned State Government recommending the review of this law by the State, with a 
view to repeal. 
The aforesaid Act has become irrelevant and obsolete in the present day scenario. 
By efflux of time and in view of the position stated at paragraphs 3 to 9 above, 
the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be considered for repeal. 
30. The Bengal Rent Act, 1859 (X of 1859) 
The aforesaid Act amends the law relating to the recovery of rent in the Presidency of 
Fort William in Bengal. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Legislative Council of India and 
received the assent of the Governor General on the 29th April, 1859. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for its repeal at SI. No.18 of 
Annexure A-5 of its Report (114 central Acts to be repealed by the State Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at Sl. No. 24 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for removal from the list. The Law Commission observed that the 
aforesaid Act amended the existing Regulations and Acts relating to the recovery of rent in 
the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal. This Act has been repealed by Section 59 of the 
West Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1955. Therefore, the Central Government should remove 
this law from its lists of central Acts in force. 
As per the records made available to the Committee by the Legislative 
Department, the aforesaid Act has been indicated as partially repealed. After 
ascertaining the position of the fact of the repeal of the aforesaid Act, necessary action 
may be taken by the Legislative Department for repeal or recording the fact of having 
repeal of the aforesaid Act in the Statutes Book. 
31. The Bengal Land Revenue Sales Act, 1859 (XI of 1859) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to improve the law relating to sales of land for 
arrears of revenue in the lower Provinces under the Bengal Presidency. The aforesaid Act 
was passed by the Legislative Council of India and received the assent of the Governor 
General on the 4th May, 1859. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for its repeal at SI. No.16 of 
Annexure A-5 of its Report (114 Central Acts to be repealed by the State Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at Sl. No. 25 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act in consultation with relevant 
State(s) referring to the earlier recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law 
Commission observed that the aforesaid Act was meant to improve the law relating to sales 
of land for arrears of revenue in the provinces of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa (as they existed at 
the time). Although enacted by the Governor-General-in-Council prior to independence, it is 
310 
now administered by the relevant State which also has the power to repeal or amend this law. 
The Government of Odisha has already repealed the law. Therefore, the Central Government 
should write to the other concerned State Governments recommending the review of this law 
with a view to repeal. The Central Government should also remove this law from its lists of 
central Acts in force. 
The aforesaid Act has become irrelevant and obsolete in the present day scenario. 
By efflux of time and in view of the position stated at paragraphs 3 to 9 above, 
the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be considered for repeal. 
32. The Madras District Police Act, 1859 (XXIV of 1859) 
The aforesaid Act provides for the better regulation of the Police within the territories 
subject to the President of Fort St. George. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Legislative 
Council of India and received the assent of the Governor General on the 6th September, 
1859. The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for its repeal at Sl. No.60 of 
Annexure A-5 of its Report (114 Central Acts to be repealed by the State Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at Sl. No. 26 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. The Law Commission observed 
that the aforesaid Act provided for reorganising the police force in the State of Tamil Nadu so 
as to make it a more efficient instrument for the prevention and detection of crime. The Act 
was rechristened the Tamil Nadu District Police Act, 1859 by means of the Adaptation Order 
of 1969 and the Act is still in use. Hence, the Central Government should remove this law 
from its lists of central Acts in force. 
The aforesaid Act has become irrelevant and obsolete in the present day scenario. 
By efflux of time and in view of the position stated at paragraphs 3 to 9 above, 
the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be considered for repeal. 
33. Partition of Revenue-paying Estates (XIX of 1863) 
The aforesaid Act consolidates and amends the law relating to the Partition of Estates 
paying revenue to Government in the North-Western Provinces of the Presidency of Fort 
William in Bengal. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Governor General of India in 
Council and received the assent of the Governor General on the 10th March, 1863. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for its repeal at Sl. No.75 of 
Annexure A-5 of its Report (114 Central Acts to be repealed by the State Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at Sl. No. 29 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act in consultation with relevant 
State(s) referring to the earlier recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law 
Commission observed that the aforesaid Act was enacted to consolidate and amend the law 
relating to partition of estates paying revenue to government in the North-Western Provinces 
of the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal (which lies in modern-day Uttar Pradesh). 
Although enacted by the Governor-General-in-Council prior to independence, it is now 
administered by the relevant State which also has the power to repeal or amend this law. 
Therefore, the Central Government should write to the concerned State Government 
recommending the review of this law by the State, with a view to repeal. The Central 
Government should also remove this law from its lists of central Acts in force. 
The aforesaid Act has become irrelevant and obsolete in the present scenario. 
By efflux of time and in view of the position stated at paragraphs 3 to 9 above, 
the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be considered for repeal. 
311 
34. The Waste-lands (Claims) Act, 1863 (XXIII of 1863) 
The aforesaid Act provides for the adjudication of claims to waste lands. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for its repeal at SI. No.101 of 
Annexure A-5 of its Report (114 Central Acts to be repealed by the State Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th Report at 51. No.14 under Chapter 4 of its 
Report has recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act and, inter alia, observed that the 
aforesaid Act was enacted to establish the procedures for adjudication of claims made in 
relation to waste-lands and at the time of enactment, all land not used for agriculture as 
waste-lands, and the colonial State asserted control over these lands. It further observed that a 
majority of what was previously considered waste-land is now being administered under the 
Indian Forests Act, 1927 and the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers 
(Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 and Waste-land is now considered to be the 
common property of the village communities. It also observed that the continuation of this 
Act would lead to perpetuation of the colonial mind-set surrounding management of waste- 
lands. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No. 6 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed inter alia stated that- 
[This Act is a remnant of the colonial discourse surrounding waste-lands. Prior to Independence, all 
lands that were not under cultivation were classified as waste-lands and the State asserted proprietary 
rights over them. The colonial government wanted to assert control over waste-lands to claim revenue 
from it. Such title was sold to the public by the government. 
Under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, all matters relating to land are within the exclusive 
legislative and administrative jurisdiction of State Governments. Land classified as waste-land 
according to current government norms, whether under revenue land or forests, would fall within the 
jurisdiction of the state governments. Any claims relating to such land will follow the Revenue Code/ 
Acts administered by the State governments. 
Government's discourse regarding waste-lands has significantly changed post-Independence and the 
need to use such lands for agriculture has now assumed prominence. Waste-land management 
programmes now accord significance to the fact that waste-lands are the common property of village 
communities and the economic and ecological contributions of these lands are taken note of The 
proprietary rights of the State have been replaced with a close relationship between the environment 
and the community living within that area as the community derives sustenance from it. The 
continuation of this Act under the changed legal and policy circumstances serves no purpose.]. 
By efflux of time and in view of the position stated at paragraphs 3 to 9 above, 
the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be considered for repeal. 
35. The Oudh Sub-settlement Act, 1866 (XXVI of 1866). 
The aforesaid Act legalizes the rules made by the Chief Commissioner of Oudh for 
the better determination of certain claims of subordinate proprietors in that province. 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th Report at SI. No. 15 under Chapter 4 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. The Law Commission observed that 
the Act was enacted to give the force of law to the rules made by the Chief Commissioner of 
Oudh for determining the claims of persons claiming property titles in the province and the 
Act is redundant as Oudh has ceased to exist as an administrative unit. 
The Centre for Civil Society at 51. No. 8 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that the princely state of Oudh does not exist anymore and also, the 
Rules regarding sub-settlement and other subordinate rights of property in Oudh are not in 
force now and hence, the Act does not serve any discernible purpose anymore. It further 
312 
stated that under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, all matters relating to land are 
within the exclusive legislative and administrative jurisdiction of State governments and any 
claims to title/ property rights are adjudicated in terms of respective the Land Revenue 
Code/Acts administered by the State governments and the Civil Procedure Code. It appears 
that the aforesaid Society inadvertently mentioned the Oudh Sub-settlement Act, 1867 instead 
Oudh Sub-settlement Act, 1866 (26 of 1866). 
By efflux of time and in view of the position stated at paragraphs 3 to 9 above, 
the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be considered for repeal. 
36. The Sarais Act, 1867 (XXII of 1867) 
The aforesaid Act provides for regulation of public Sarais and Puraos. The aforesaid 
Act was passed by the Governor General of India in Council and received the assent of the 
Governor General on the 15th March, 1867. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for its repeal at Sl. No.88 of 
Annexure A-5 of its Report (114 central Acts to be repealed by the State Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th  Report at Sl. No. 17 under Chapter 4 of the 
Report has recommended for repeal in consultation with the State(s) and inter alia observed 
that the Act empowers the District Magistrate to regulate public sarais. It includes provisions 
related to registration, character certificate, and written reports from the sarai keeper, among 
others. It further observed that the aforesaid Act is now redundant because hotels are already 
registered under relevant state legislations and regulations made thereunder. Further, it has 
been reported in the news that police and tourism officials have harassed hotel owners in the 
recent past for failure to comply with the provisions of the Sarais Act and hence, this Act 
should now be repealed. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No. 69 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed inter alio, stated that the aforesaid Act is archaic and serves no useful purpose, since 
an adequate regulatory mechanism exists for the regulation of hotels by Tourism Departments 
in every state. It further stated that the subject matter of this Act belongs to the State list, 
under 'inns and inn-keepers' in Entry 31 of the State List and thus it is not an appropriate 
subject for a Central legislation. It also stated that the aforesaid Act is used to harass hotel 
owners, as indicated by recent news reports, for instance, a hotel in Delhi was harassed 
because it did not offer free drinking water to passers-by, as required under the Sarais Act. 
By efflux of time and in view of the position stated at paragraphs 3 to 9 above, 
the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be considered for repeal. 
37. The Oudh Estates Act, 1869 (I of 1869) 
The aforesaid Act defines the rights of Taluzdars and others in certain estates in 
Oudh, and to regulate the succession thereto. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Governor 
General of India in Council and received the assent of the Governor General on the 12th 
January, 1869. 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th  Report at Sl. No. 19 under Chapter 4 of the 
Report has recommended for repeal in consultation with State(s) and inter alia, observed that 
the aforesaid Act defines and regulates the succession rights of Taluqdars and other 
landholders in certain estates in Oudh and both Oudh and the Taluqdari system no longer 
exist, therefore, the provisions of this Act are redundant. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No. 9 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that Princely states, including Oudh, have ceased to exist in India 
and the Taluqdari system has also been abolished, therefore, this Act is completely obsolete. 
313 
It further stated that under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, all matters relating to 
land are within the exclusive legislative and administrative jurisdiction of state governments 
and any claims to title and property rights are adjudicated in terms of respective the Land 
Revenue Code/Acts administered by the state governments and the Civil Procedure Code. 
By efflux of time and in view of the position stated at paragraphs 3 to 9 above, 
the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be considered for repeal. 
38. The Oudh Taluqdars Relief Act, 1870 (XXIV of 1870) 
The aforesaid Act relieves from incumbrances the estates of Taluqdars in Oudh. This 
Act has become irrelevant in view of Estates abolition and obsolete in the present day 
scenario and needs to be repealed. 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th  Report at Si. No. 20 under Chapter 4 of the 
Report has recommended for repeal in consultation with State(s) and, inter alio, observed 
that in Oudh, in colonial and pre-colonial India, many Taluqdars were indebted, and as a 
result, their immovable property was subject to mortgages and liens. It further observed that 
the aforesaid Act provided a procedure to settle the debts of these Taluqdars and relieve them 
and as mentioned above, neither the princely state of Oudh nor the Taluqdari system exists 
today; therefore, the provisions of this Act are redundant. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No. 10 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed inter alio stated that Princely states, including Oudh, have ceased to exist in India 
and the Taluqdari system has also been abolished, therefore, this Act is completely obsolete. 
By efflux of time and in view of the position stated at paragraphs 3 to 9 above, 
the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be considered for repeal. 
39. The Coroners Act, 1871 (IV of 1871) 
The aforesaid Act consolidates and amends the laws relating to Coroners. Originally 
the aforesaid Act was extended to the local limits of the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of 
the High Courts of Judicature at Fort Williams, Madras and Bombay and the aforesaid Act 
came into force from the 27th January, 1871. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for its repeal at Sl. No.39 of 
Annexure A-5 of its Report (114 Central Acts to be repealed by the State Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 206th  Report inter alio, observed that with a view 
to have uniformity of the law applicable throughout India, it may be considered that the 
extant Coroners Act, 1871 should be repealed in order that the provisions of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, viz., sections 174 to 176 govern the field in the aforesaid territorial 
jurisdictions of Calcutta and Bombay also, besides the rest of India. It further observed that 
the enactment of a new Coroners Act applicable to the whole of India, in addition to the said 
provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, is felt to be the need of the hour and in view of 
the aforesaid, it has been decided to suggest to the Government of India that a necessary 
independent authority may be constituted to inquire into the true and real cause of death of a 
person, even if such a person dies outside the territorial limits of the country. 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at SI. No. 30 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. The Law Commission observed 
that the aforesaid Act amended the law relating to coroners. However, this Act has a limited 
extent and provides for the appointment of coroners only within the local limits of the 
ordinary original civil jurisdiction of the High Courts of Bombay and Calcutta. The High 
Court of Delhi, in Social ,Jurist, a Civil Rights Group v. Union of India [WP (C) No. 
6179/2007], recommended the Law Commission to examine whether a legislation like the 
314 
Coroners Act, 1988 in force in the United Kingdom is needed in India. Consequently, the 
Law Commission, in its 206th Report (June 2008) carried a proposal for enactment of a new 
Coroners Act applicable to the whole of India. The Law Commission recommended repeal of 
the 1871 Act and the enactment of a new Coroners Act which extends to the whole of India. 
In this regard, the Law Commission proposed the Coroners Bill, 2008, the text of which is 
annexed to the 206th Report. Hence, the Central Government should repeal the 1871 Act and 
take up the Coroners Bill, 2008 (as recommended by the Law Commission) for consideration. 
Attention is drawn to paragaraph at page 13 of the Report which reads as follows:— 
"With a view to have uniformity of the law applicable though out India, it may be considered that the 
extant Coroners Act, 1871 should be repealed in order that the provisions of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure viz., sections 174 to 176 govern the field in the aforesaid territorial jurisdictions of Calcutta 
and Bombay also, besides the rest of India. Further, enactment of a new Coroners Act applicable to the 
whole of India, in addition to the said provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, is felt to be the need 
of the hour.". The draft Bill appended to the said Report of the Law Commission does not contain 
provisions for repealing the aforesaid Act.". 
Attention is drawn to sections 3 and 8 of the aforesaid Act which read as under:- 
[Coroners of Calcutta and Bombay- 
3. Within the local limits of the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of each of the High Courts of 
Judicature at Fort William and Bombay there shall be a Coroner. 	
Such Coroners shall be called 
respectively the Coroner of Calcutta and the Coroner of Bombay. 
Jurisdiction to inquire into deaths.- 
8. When a Coroner has reason to believe that the death of any person has been caused by accident, 
homicide, suicide, or suddenly by means unknown, or that any person being a prisoner has died in prison, 
and that the body is lying within the place for which the Coroner is so appointed, the Coroner shall 
inquire into the cause of death. Every such inquiry shall be deemed a judicial proceeding within the 
meaning of section 193 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860)] 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed and for enactment of 
the law on the subject has been suggested under Chapter-10. 
40. The Dehradun Act, 1871 (XXI of 1871) 
The aforesaid Act gives validity to the operation of the General Regulations and Acts 
within the Dehra Dun. 
The Law Commission in its 148th  Report had earlier opined that they are not in a 
position to recommend the repeal of the Dehradun Act. 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th  Report has recommended for its repeal at 
Sl. No.21 under Chapter 4 of the Report in consultation with the State(s) and, inter alia, 
observed that the aforesaid Act was enacted to give validity within Dehradun to the operation 
of general Regulations and Acts in force in Saharanpur. It further observed that it was done 
because the territory of Dehradun was on several occasions moved from one jurisdiction to 
another by various legislative enactments. It also observed that the 148th Law Commission 
Report, 1993 considered but did not recommend repeal of this Act observing that territorial 
changes made in a particular year do not render redundant all enactments passed earlier, in 
order to deal with the consequences of any territorial changes that may have raised legal 
issues. The Commission also observed that Dehradun is now the capital of the State of 
Uttarakhand and all laws enacted by the Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly would have 
application to Dehradun and more than 140 years have passed since the enactment of this 
Statute, for the resolution of legal consequences, hence, this Act can be repealed. 
By efflux of time and in view of the position stated at paragraphs 3 to 9 above, 
the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be considered for repeal. 
315 
41. The Punjab Laws Act, 1872 (IV of 1872) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted for declaring certain rules, laws and regulations 
have the force of law in the Punjab, and for other purposes. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for its repeal at SI. No.111 of 
Annexure A-5 of its Report (114 Central Acts to be repealed by the State Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th Report has also recommended for its 
repeal at SI. No.22 under Chapter 4 of Report. The Law Commission observed that the Act 
declares which of certain laws are to have effect in Punjab and Delhi. It has been amended in 
1956 to alter the applicability to the modern state of Punjab. Apart from extending laws, it 
also validates local customs, establishes local watchmen and grants the power to raise local 
taxes to pay the police. The powers conferred under the Act are archaic and newer laws exist 
that address the same matters. Hence, this Act can be repealed subject to factual verification 
that a law in force does not solely depend on this Act for its applicability. 
By efflux of time this Act has become redundant and obsolete in the present day 
scenario and needs to be repealed. 
By efflux of time and in view of the position stated at paragraphs 3 to 9 above, 
the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be considered for repeal. 
42. The Laws Local Extent Act, 1874 (XV of 1874) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted for declaring the local extent of certain Enactments, 
and for other purposes. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Governor General of India in 
Council and received the assent of the Governor General on the 1st March, 1867. 
The P.C. Jain Commission also recommended for its repeal at Si. No. 68 of Appendix 
A-1 of its report (166 Central Acts to be repealed by the Central Government). 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th  Report has also recommended for its repeal 
at 51. No.24 under Chapter 4 of its Report in consultation with relevant State(s). The 
Commission observed that the aforesaid Act declares the territorial extent of certain laws 
passed by the Legislative Council of India and the Council of the Governor General of India 
and there are five Schedules to this Act which enumerate the laws applicable to the whole of 
British India, to the Bombay, Madras, Bengal Presidencies, and to the North-Western 
Provinces of the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal. It further observed that the territorial 
divisions dealt with in this Act existed prior to 1947, and have no relevance to the modern 
day demarcation of States and the territorial applicability of laws is now determined under 
newer laws such as the State Reorganisation Acts and hence, this Act can be repealed subject 
to factual verification that a law in force does not solely depend on this Act for its 
applicability. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No.12 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter alia, stated that the aforesaid Act the extent of local laws as mentioned under 
this Act envisages territorial divisions, as they existed prior to 1947. It further states that 
Provinces as they existed during the British era do not exist anymore. Also, the authorities 
that enacted the laws mentioned in this Act (the Governor General of India in Council, the 
Legislative Council of India and the Council of the Governor General of India) do not exist 
now and the territorial extents of various laws in force in India now find mention in the Act 
itself, such as section 1 of every Act is called Short title, extent and commencement which 
indicates what the territorial extent of the law would be. 
The Committee, on the perusal of the aforesaid Act suggests that the aforesaid 
Act can be considered for repeal after making a special saving provision on the 
following lines, namely:— 
316 
"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in section 4, the 
repeal of the Laws Local Extent Act, 1874, shall not, after repeal of the said Act by this Act, 
affect the applicability of the Acts and Regulations mentioned in the Schedules to the 
aforesaid Act to the territories of India after such repeal and such Acts and Regulations shall 
continue to apply to such territories to which the aforesaid Act and Regulations would have 
applied before such repeal.". 
43. The Chota Nagpur Encumbered Estates Act, 1876 (VI of 1876) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to relieve certain landholders in Chutia Nagpur. 
The aforesaid Act was passed by the Governor General of India in Council and received the 
assent of the Governor General on the 14th March, 1876. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for its repeal at Si. No.36 of 
Annexure A-5 of its Report (114 Central Acts to be repealed by the State Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at Si. No. 34 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act in consultation with relevant 
State(s) referring to the earlier recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. It has 
observed that the aforesaid Act was enacted to provide for the relief of certain landholders in 
Chota Nagpur who were in debt, and whose immovable property was subject to mortgages, 
charges and liens. The group of princely States in Chota Nagpur fall in present-day 
Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Orissa, which have newer debt-relief laws and schemes. 
Consequently, the Act is now redundant. Therefore, the Central Government should write to 
the relevant State Governments recommending the review of this law by the State, with a 
view to repeal. The Central Government should also remove this law from its lists of central 
Acts in force. 
In view of the abolition of Estates, the aforesaid Act has become redundant and 
obsolete in the present day scenario and needs to be repealed. 
By efflux of time and in view of the position stated at paragraphs 3 to 9 above, 
the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be considered for repeal. 
44. The Bombay Municipal Debentures Act, 1876 (XV of 1876) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to amend the law relating to the transfer of 
Bombay Municipal Debentures and to provide for their consolidation. The aforesaid Act was 
passed by the Governor General of India in Council and received the assent of the Governor 
General on the 14th September, 1876. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for its repeal at Si. No.25 of 
Annexure A-5 of its Report (114 Central Acts to be repealed by the State Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at Si. No. 35 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act in consultation with relevant 
State(s). It has observed that the aforesaid Act amended the law relating to the transfer of 
Bombay municipal debentures, and to provide for their consolidation. Municipal debentures 
in Bombay are now dealt with in the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, 1888. This Act has 
fallen into disuse and is thus now redundant. Therefore, the Central Government should write 
to the relevant State Governments recommending the review of this law by the State, with a 
view to repeal. The Central Government should also remove this law from its lists of central 
Acts in force. 
By efflux of time this Act has become redundant and obsolete in the present scenario. 
By efflux of time and in view of the position stated at paragraphs 3 to 9 above, 
the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
317 
45. The Oudh Laws Act, 1876 (XVIII of 1876) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to declare and amend the laws to be administered in 
Oudh. 	
By efflux of time this Act has become redundant and obsolete and needs to be 
repealed. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No. 13 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed inter alia stated that Princely states have ceased to exist in India and stated that the 
former princely state of Oudh now exists as Awadh in the state of Uttar Pradesh and the 
relevant laws and customs that are covered for administration by the courts of Oudh are now 
governed under respective statutes under the Constitution. 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th  Report has also recommended for its repeal

was largely repealed by the Broach and Kaira Incumbered Estates Act, 1881, but a few 
sections remain on the books. It is now in disuse, and the Central Government should write to 
the relevant State Governments recommending the review of this law by the State, with a 
view to repeal. The Central Government should also remove this law from its lists of central 
Acts in force.

namely Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu all now have 
separate debt relief laws; hence, the purpose of this Act has been subsumed by other laws. 
The Commission further observed that since the competent legislature for the subject of 
agricultural indebtedness is the State, repeal must proceed accordingly, for example, the 
erstwhile State of Bombay expressly repealed the 1879 Act. It also observed that the 
aforesaid Act may be recommended for repeal to the States to which it has been extended by 
notification. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No. 81 of its compendium of 100 laws to be

their own rent control and tenancy Acts making this Act irrelevant. It must therefore be 
repealed. The Central Government should write to the relevant State Governments 
recommending the review of this law by the State, with a view to repeal. The Central 
Government should also remove this law from its lists of central Acts in force.

the grant of loans to local authorities. Local authorities are now a State subject and this law is

recommending the review of this law by the State, with a view to repeal. The Central 
Government should also remove this law from its lists of central Acts in force. The Law 
Commission recommended repeal, in consultation with relevant State(s). 
Now, with the enactment of Municipal Laws by the State Governments, the 
aforesaid Act has become irrelevant and obsolete. By efflux of time and in view of the 
position stated at paragraphs 3 to 9 above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act 
can be repealed after making suitable provisions. 
66. Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy Baronetcy Act, 1915 (X of 1915) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted for repealing Act No. XX of 1860 entitled "An 
Act for settling Promissory Notes of the Government of India, producing an annual income of 
one lakh of rupees and a Mansion House and hereditaments called Mazagon Castle, in the 
Island of Bombay, late the property of Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy, Baronet, deceased, so as to 
accompany and support the title and dignity of a Baronet, lately conferred on him and the 
heirs male of his body, by Her Majesty Queen Victoria, and for other purposes connected 
therewith," and for re-settling the said Promissory Notes, Mansion House and hereditaments 
and for other purposes connected therewith. This Act confers certain powers on the Trust 
created under the Act. This Act was passed by the Governor General of India in Council and 
received the assent of the Governor General on the 7th September, 1915. 
The P.C. Jain Commission also recommended for its repeal at Sl. No. 93 of Appendix 
A-5 (114 Central Acts for repeal by the State Governments). 
The Committee feels that repeal of the aforesaid Act is required to be re-visited in 
view of the following:— 
(a) article 18 of the Constitution reads as under:— 
[Abolition of titles. 
18. (1 )No title, not being a military or academic distinction, shall be conferred by the State. 
327 
(2) No citizen of India shall accept any title from any foreign State. 
(3) No person who is not a citizen of India shall, while he holds any office of profit or trust under 
the State, accept without the consent of the President any title from any foreign State. 
(4) No person holding any office of profit or trust under the State shall, without the consent of the 
President, accept any present, emolument, or office of any kind from or under any foreign State.]. 
(b) after the commencement of the Constitution, it is a legislative practice in general 
not to enact any law which is individual specific. 
(c) There is a legislative precedent for repealing the Sir Currimbhoy Ebrahim 
Baronetcy Act, 1913 (which was enacted for settling certain properties belonging to Sir 
Currimbhoy Ebrahim, Baronet, so as to accompany and support the title and dignity of a 
Baronet lately conferred on him by His Majesty Kind George V to hold to him and the heirs 
of male of his body lawfully begotten, and to be begotten, and for other purposes connected 
therewith) by Bombay Act No. 9 of 1960. 
In view of the Constitutional provisions, the Committee feels that the Legislative 
Department may consider the repeal of the aforesaid Act in consultation with all the 
stakeholders. 
67. The King of Oudh's Estate Validation Act, 1917 (XII of 1917) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to validate certain deeds of conveyance and a trust 
deed relating to certain properties of His Late Majesty, Wajid Ali Shah, King of Oudh and for 
other purposes. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Indian Legislative Council and received 
the assent of the Governor General on the 21st March, 1917. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for its repeal at SI. No.105 of 
Appendix A-5 (114 Central Acts for repeal by the State Governments). 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th Report has also recommended for its 
repeal at SI. No.43 under Chapter 4 of the Report. The Law Commission observed that the 
Act was enacted to validate deeds of conveyance and a trust deed relating to certain 
properties belonging to the King of Oudh. Copies of the said deeds of conveyance and trust 
deed are annexed in the Schedule to this Act. The reason for repeal for the 1887 Act and the 
1888 Act (Entries 31 and 32 of this list) applies to this Act as well. 
By efflux of time and in view of the position stated at paragraphs 3 to 9 above, 
the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be considered for repeal.. 
68. The Local Authorities Pensions and Gratuities Act, 1919 (I of 1919) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to extend the powers of local authorities in regard to 
the granting of pensions and gratuities. 
The P.C. Jain Commission also recommended for its repeal at SI. No. 54 of 
Appendix-A-5 of its report (114 Central Acts relating to State subjects for repeal by State 
Governments) 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at SI. No. 3 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission, inter alia, observed 
that the aforesaid Act extended the powers of local authorities in regard to the granting of 
pensions and gratuities. The Act empowered local authorities to grant a pension or gratuity to 
any officer who may, since 4th August 1914, have been wounded or otherwise incapacitated 
328 
in service under the Government, and to the widow or child of any such officer who may 
have died in consequence of injuries received or illness contracted since 4th August 1914, in 
the course of such service. The Act has fallen into disuse. Most States now have their own 
Pension Rules and the purpose of this Act is subsumed by such rules. Therefore, this Act is 
now redundant and the Central Government should repeal it. 
With the enactment of Municipal Laws by the State Governments, the aforesaid 
Act became irrelevant and obsolete. By efflux of time and in view of the position stated 
at paragraphs 3 to 9 above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be 
considered for repeal. 
69. The Police (Incitement and Disaffection) Act, 1922 (XXII of 1922) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide a penalty for spreading disaffection 
among the police and for kindred offences. 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th  Report at Si. No. 44 under Chapter 4 of the 
Report observed that the aforesaid Act introduced as a curb to nationalist activities made it an 
offence to spread disaffection among the police. It further observed that the aforesaid Act is 
loosely worded and prone to misuse and also the aforesaid Act does not describe what 
amounts to 'disaffection'. It also observed that the aforesaid law acts as a significant curb on 
the freedom of speech, though it is not an obsolete law given some documented uses. It also 
observed that the need for this law should be re-examined in light of its potential 
infringement of Articles 190) (a) and (b) of the Constitution. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No. 83 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed, inter cilia, stated that the aforesaid Act is an archaic law passed by the British to 
suppress the freedom of speech and weaken the Independence movement. It further stated 
that the law is widely worded to empower the government to take action against any person 
who intentionally causes or attempts to cause disaffection towards government amongst the 
member of police force and the Act is not in tune with the Code of Conduct for the Police in 
India, issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs on 4 July 1985. It further stated that the Code 
of Conduct directs members of the police force to maintain high standards of discipline, 
faithful performance of duties in accordance with law, implicit obedience to the lawful 
directions of commanding ranks and absolute loyalty to the force. It also stated that the police 
are required to maintain calm in the face of danger, scorn or ridicule and practice self-
restraint in all circumstances and these guidelines indicate that the police force is required to 
be immune to the voices of disaffection. It also stated that the aforesaid Act is vague and 
loosely worded, and does not clearly explain what activity is regarded as spreading 
disaffection and consequently, it is left to the arbitrary interpretation of enforcing authorities 
and is liable to be misused. It also stated that the aforesaid Act was first used against 
Lolcmanya Tilak and recently, in September 2013, the Andhra Pradesh Police filed a criminal 
case against the resident editor of Hindu for reporting the visit of a senior police officer to a 
local religious leader under IPC dealing with forgery, another dealing with inducing the 
commission of an offence against the State or another community, and also under this Act. 
By efflux of time and in the changed social changes and in view of fundamental rights 
guaranteed under the Constitution, the Act appears to have become obsolete and needs to be 
reviewed. 
The subject "Police" falls under Entry 2 of the List II (State List) of the Seventh 
Schedule to the Constitution. However, the Parliament has legislative competence in 
respect of Union territories to repeal the aforesaid Act. 
329 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed so far as it is 
applicable to Union territories and can be considered for repeal by the concerned State 
Legislatures. 
70. The Sikh Gurdwaras (Supplementary) Act, 1925 (XXIV of 1925) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to supplement, by legislation in the Indian Legislature 
certain provisions of the Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925 (Punj. Act VIII of 1925). The aforesaid 
Act was passed by the Indian Legislature and received the assent of the Governor General on 
the Ilth September, 1925. 
The aforesaid Act contains three sections. Section 2 contains validation of certain 
provisions of the Punj. Act VIII of 1925 which, inter alia, relates to jurisdiction of the High 
Court of Judicature at Lahore. Section 3 amends section 12 of the Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925 
(Punj. Act VIII of 1925) and the Sikh Gurdwaras (Supplementary) Act, 1925 served its 
purpose. 
In view of the provisions of the Constitution, and section 6A of the General Clauses 
Act, 1897, the Sikh Gurdwaras (Supplementary) Act, 1925 has become redundant as the 
amendments have been incorporated in the principal Act. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed in consultation with 
the Ministry of Home Affairs and the concerned State Governments, in the light of legal 
opinion, if any, on this issue, as the subject matter is relatable to Entry 28 of List III-
Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. 
71. The Bengal Criminal Law Amendment (Supplementary) Act, 1925 
(VIII of 1925) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to supplement the Bengal Criminal Law 
Amendment Act, 1925 in furtherance of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at SI. No. 4 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. The Law Commission, inter alia, 
observed that the Act supplemented the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1925. The 
Act provided that any person convicted on a trial held by Commissioners under the Bengal 
Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1925 may appeal to the High Court of Judicature at Fort 
William in Bengal, and such appeal was to be disposed of by the High Court in the manner 
provided by the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. The 1898 Code has been repealed by the 
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 but corresponding amendments have not been made to this 
Supplementary Act. Consequently, the Act is now redundant. There is no evidence of recent 
use of this Act. Hence, the Central Government should repeal this Act after consultation with 
the State of West Bengal. 
The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 has been repealed by the Code of Criminal 
Procedure Act, 1973 (2 of 1974). In view of the repeal of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, 
the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment (Supplementary) Act, 1925 has become redundant and 
obsolete. 
By efflux of time and in view of the position stated at paragraphs 3 to 9 above, 
the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be considered for repeal. 
330

The aforesaid Act was passed by the Indian Legislature and received the assent of the 
Governor General on the 23rd September, 1925. 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at Sl. No.5 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. The Law Commission, inter cilia, 
observed that the Act supplemented certain provisions of the Madras Children Act, 1920 
(which was rechristened as the Tamil Nadu Children Act, 1920 by the Tamil Nadu 
Adaptation of Laws Order, 1969), the Bengal Children Act, 1922 and the Bombay Children 
Act, 1924. The Bengal Children Act has been repealed by Section 51 of the West Bengal 
Children Act, 1959. The Bombay Children Act, 1924 was repealed by the Bombay Children 
Act, 1948. Also, Section 63 of the Juvenile Justice Act, 1986 repealed all laws in force in any 
State which corresponded to the Juvenile Justice Act. By virtue of Section 63, the Tamil 
Nadu Children Act, 1920 should stand impliedly repealed. The Central Government should 
write to the State of Tamil Nadu and ascertain the status of the Tamil Nadu Children Act, 
1920 and thereafter, consider the Supplementary Act for repeal. This Act has also been 
recommended for repeal by the PC Jain Commission Report (Appendix A-1) and by the 
Ministry of Women and Child Development in its letter F. No. 22-22/2014-CW-I dated 30th 
September 2014 to the Member Secretary, Law Commission of India.

The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at Sl. No. 15 under Chapter 2 of the

observed that the Act amended the Bombay Public Security Measures Act, 1947 as extended 
to the Province of Delhi. The text of the Bombay Public Security Measures Act, 1947 is not 
available on the Law Ministry's website, or from any other readily available source, an 
indication that it is not in use. Neither are there any other documented instances where this 
Act has been used in the last few decades. The Delhi Amendment Act has also now fallen 
into disuse. Therefore, the Central Government should repeal this Act.

ACt contains only three sections. Section 1 relates to short title and extent. Section 2

Measures Act, 1947. The aforesaid Act have come into force on the 8th September, 1948 i.e.,

central Acts in force.

CHAPTER-6 
CENTRAL APPROPRIATION ACTS IDENTIFIED FOR REPEAL 
The 'Annual Financial Statement', under article 112 of the Constitution of India 
which is laid before both the Houses of Parliament constitutes the Budget of the Union 
Government. This statement takes into account a period of one financial year. The financial 
year commences in India on 1st April each year. The statement embodies the estimated 
receipts and expenditure of the Government of India for the financial year. 
2. 
The estimates of expenditure included in the Budget and required to be voted by 
Lok Sabha are in the form of Demands for Grants. These Demands are arranged Ministry-
wise and a separate Demand for each of the major services is presented. Each Demand 
contains first a statement of the total grant and then a statement of the detailed estimate 
divided into items. 
3. 
After the General Discussion on the Budget proposals and Voting on Demands for 
Grants have been completed, Government introduces the Appropriation Bill in the Lok Sabha 
(being a Money Bill referred to in article 110 of the Constitution) in terms of the provisions 
of article 114 of the Constitution. The Appropriation Bill is intended to give authority to 
Government to incur expenditure from and out of the Consolidated Fund of India. The 
Appropriation Bill after enactment thereof as Appropriation Act gives legal sanction to the 
grants voted by the Parliament. After the Appropriation Act is enacted, the limitation of 
expenditure under a head is to be determined solely with reference to the Schedule of the 
Appropriation Act and money appropriated towards a particular head is to be spent on that 
head only unless the Schedule is amended by an appropriate law, or rule having the force of 
law, consistent with the Constitution. 
4. 
Since Parliament is not able to vote the entire budget before the commencement of the 
new financial year (Financial Year as defined under clause (21) of section 3 of the General 
Clauses Act, 1897 means the year commencing on the first day of April), the necessity to 
keep enough finance at the disposal of Government in order to allow it to run the 
administration of the country remains which is generally called "Vote on Account" (Refer 
article 116 of the Constitution). The 'Vote on Account' can be brought before the Parliament 
in the Form of an Appropriation for a sum sufficient to incur expenditure on various items for 
a part of the year by an Appropriation (Vote on Account) Act. 
5. 
Further, no expenditure in excess of the sums authorised by Parliament can be 
incurred without the sanction of Parliament. Whenever a need arises to incur extra 
expenditure, a Supplementary estimate also in the form of an Appropriation is presented 
before Parliament (Refer article 115 of the Constitution). Also, if any money has been spent 
on any service during a financial year in excess of the amounts granted for that service and 
for that year, a Demand for Excess Grant is presented before Parliament in the form of an 
Appropriation (Refer article 115 of the Constitution). 
6. 
In nutshell, the Appropriation Acts can be categorised in two categories, namely, (i) 
for general estimates and (ii) for Railways estimates. It can further be categorised as (i) for 
the general Appropriation; (ii) Appropriation for Vote on Account; and (iii) Appropriation for 
supplementary, additional or excess grant. 
336 
7.

337

115. (1) The President shall—

(b) if any money has been spent on any service during a financial year in excess of the amount

the passing of the law in accordance with the provisions of article 114 in relation to that expenditure; 
(b) to make a grant for meeting an unexpected demand upon the resources of India when on account 
of the magnitude or the indefinite character of the service the demand cannot be stated with the details 
ordinarily given in an annual financial statement; 
(c) to make an exceptional grant which forms no part of the current service of any financial year; 
and Parliament shall have power to authorise by law the withdrawal of moneys from the 
Consolidated Fund of India for the purposes for which the said grants are made. 
(2) The provisions of articles 113 and 114 shall have effect in relation to the making of any

making of a grant with regard to any expenditure mentioned in the annual financial statement and the 
law to be made for the authorisation of appropriation of moneys out of the Consolidated Fund of India 
to meet such expenditure.". 
8. 	
The Law Commission of India in its 248th Report has also, inter cilia, observed that:— 
" 	
During the course of its study the Commission found that a large number of 
Appropriation Acts passed during past several years have lost their meaning but these are still 
shown on statue-books. It is common knowledge that Appropriation Acts are intended to 
operate for a limited period of time-authorising expenditures for the duration of one financial 
year, or less, for example in the case of Vote on Account Bills. Though these Acts are not 
usually included in any list of Central Acts, either by the Ministry of Law and Justice, or 
elsewhere, these laws still technically remain on the books. 
3.6 It must be emphasised that repealing Appropriation Acts whose terms have ended will in 
no way cause any negative impact on actions that were validly taken under these Acts. It will, 
however, serve the purpose of clearing the statute-books and reducing the burden. As a 
caution and not entertaining scope of any doubt it may be safe to recommend that only those 
338 
Appropriation Acts that are older than certain date, say 10 years, may be repealed. This itself 
would result in the repeal of more than 700 laws.". 
9. 	
The P.C. Jain Commission in its Report in Para 16.4.5 has recommended for repeal of 
about 700 Appropriation Acts passed by Parliament from time-to-time since 1950. 
10. In view of the recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission on the Appropriation 
Acts, and Law Commission, the Committee sought from the Department of Legal Affairs the 
opinion of the Ld. Attorney General of India, if any. The Department of Legal Affairs 
forwarded to the Committee the opinion dated 13th December, 1999 of the then Ld. Attorney 
General [Refer SI. No. 1 of Volume I, Part II] on the repeal of the Appropriation Act. The 
opinion of the then Ld. Attorney General so forwarded to the Committee, inter alio, is as 
under:— 	
the Appropriation Acts cannot be regarded as temporary statutes. Consequently, the 
appropriate course open to the Government is to enact a comprehensive legislation repealing all 
Appropriation Acts placed in a schedule to the legislation with an express saving clause in terms 
of section 6 of the General Clauses Act. Such a saving clause would address the apprehensions 
expressed that the repeal of the Appropriation Acts will render all Finance 
Accounts/Appropriation Accounts and Audit Reports laid in both Houses of Parliament null and 
void.". 
11. 
While perusing the Appropriation Acts from the year 1950 onwards, the Committee 
noticed following two categories of Central Appropriation Acts enacted from the year 1950 
onwards, namely:— 
(a) the Central Appropriation Acts enacted in terms of articles 114, 115 and 116 (on 
which the Parliament has exclusive power for such enactment) for the Ministries and 
Departments of the Union (including Railways); and 
(b) the Central Appropriation Acts in respect of a called State (mentioning the name 
of the relevant State) Appropriation Acts enacted by Parliament in pursuance of articles 
204(1), 205 and 206 of the Constitution read with the proclamation issued under article 356 
of the Constitution in respect of that State to provide for the appropriation out of the Fund of 
that State of the Moneys required to meet the expenditure charged or voted on the 
Consolidated Fund of that State during the period continuation of the Proclamation issued 
under article 352 or article 356 of the Constitution in respect of such States. 
12. 	
The Committee, inter alio, sought the opinion of the Department of Legal Affairs on 
the legislative competence of Parliament for repealing the State Appropriation Acts enacted 
by Parliament in pursuance of articles 204 (1) and 206 of the Constitution read with the 
Proclamation issued under article 356 in respect of that State. 
13. 	
The Department of Legal Affairs has, inter alio, conveyed [Refer SI. No. 2 of Volume 
1, Part 	
that the laws made by Parliament relating to State Appropriation Acts enacted 
during the period of Proclamation under article 356 can only be repealed by a competent 
Legislature and competent Legislature in those matter is the State Legislature. The Ld. 
Attorney General has concurred the aforesaid views of the Department of Legal Affairs. 
339 
14. 
The Committee, while identifying the Appropriation Acts which can be repealed, has 
taken into consideration the Report of the 13th  Finance Commission (which recommended for 
sharing of revenues between Centre and States from ln April, 2010 to 3151  March, 2015) 
[Refer ST No. 4 of Volume IV, Part III]. 
15. 
In view of the above, the Committee is of the view that the Central Appropriation 
Acts which relates to the expenditure for the Financial Years upto 31st  March, 2010 can be 
repealed after making a specific saving clause for the moneys drawn and spent in pursuance 
of the Appropriation Acts. The Committee identified the following 624 Central Appropriation 
Acts for repeal which has also been included in the Third Schedule to the Model Draft Bill

SUGGESTED CONSOLIDATION OF TWO OR MORE 
CENTRAL ACTS IDENTIFIED FOR 
RE-ENACTMET INTO A SINGLE CENTRAL ACT 
GROUP - I 
LAWS RELATING TO PREVENTION OF IMPROPER USE OF CERTAIN 
EMBLEM and NAMES etc. 
The Emblem and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950 and 
the State Emblem of India (Prohibition of Improper Use) Act, 2005 
1. 	
The Emblem and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950 
(12 of 1950) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to prevent the improper use of certain emblems 
and names for professional and commercial purposes. Clause (a) of section 2 of the Act 
defines the term "emblem" which means (i) the name emblem of official seal of the United 
Nations 	
Organization, 	
(ii) 	
the name, emblem or official 	
seal 	
of the 	
World Health 
Organisation (iii) the Indian National Flag and (iv) the name, emblem or official seal of the 
Government of India or of any State or any other insignia or coat-of-arms used by any such 
Government or by a Department of any such Government. The aforesaid Act, inter alia, 
provides for the prohibition of improper use of certain emblems and names, prohibition of 
registration of certain companies etc., penalty (which may extend upto five hundred rupees) 
for contravention of provisions of the Act. 
2. 	
The State Emblem of India (Prohibition of Improper Use) Act, 2005 
(50 of 2005) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to prohibit the improper use of State Emblem of 
India for professional and commercial purposes and for matters connected therewith or 
incidental thereto. Clause (b) of section 2 of the Act defines the term "emblem" which means 
the State Emblem of India as described and specified in the Schedule to be used as an official 
seal of the Government.

of emblem, prohibition of use of emblem for wrongful gain, prohibition of registration of 
certain companies etc., penalty which, inter alia, provides for two years imprisonment and 
with fine which may extend upto five thousand rupees for contravention of the provisions of 
the Act. 
The Committee feels that the two different Ministries administers the aforesaid 
two Acts which have common legislative intent and subject and 	
the penal provision 
vary. In order to reduce multiplicity of Acts and administering Ministries and 	
bring 
uniformity of the provisions both the aforesaid Acts, both these Acts should be repealed 
and re-enacted into a single legislation in the light of fundamental duties under article 
51A of the Constitution. 
GROUP-II 
LAWS RELATING TO SAVINGS etc. 
The Government Savings Bank Act, 1873 (5 of 1873), the Post Office Cash 
Certificates Act, 1917, the Government Savings Certificates Act, 1959 (46 
of 1959) and the Public Provident Fund Act, 1968 (23 of 1968)

3.The Government Savings Bank Act, 1873 (5 of 1873)  
The Government Savings Bank Act, 1873 (5 of 1873) has been enacted to amend the

1917) 
4. The Post Office Cash Certificates Act, 1917 (XVIII of  
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to restrict the transfer of post office five year cash 
certificates and provide for the payment of certificates standing in the name of deceased 
persons. 	
The aforesaid Act was passed by the Indian Legislative Council and received the 
assent of the Governor General on the 19th September, 1917.  
The aforesaid Act consists of three sections. 	
Section 2 provides for the prohibition 
of transfer of Post Office 5 year cash certificates without the consent of the Post Master 
General and section 3 provides for payment on death of holder of Post Office 5 year cash 
certificate.  
The aforesaid Act has become redundant in view of the enactment of Government 
Saving Certificates Act, 1959. 	
Section 7 of the 1959 deals with payment on the death of 
holder and procedure for payment thereof.  
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at Sl. No. 2 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. The Law Commission, inter alia, 
observed that the Act restricted the transfer of post office 5-year cash certificates and 
provided for the payment of certificates standing in the name of deceased persons. The 
Second Edition of the Post Office Savings Bank Manual (corrected up to 31st December 
2006) specifies that 5-year post office cash certificates were discontinued from 14th June 
1947. Consequently, this Act is now redundant. The Central Government should now repeal 
this Act. A suitable savings clause should be inserted in the repealing Act.  
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed in consultation with 
the concerned administrative Ministry i.e., Department of Posts while consolidating the 
different laws relating to saving as suggested under this Chapter.  
5. The Government Savings Certificates Act, 1959 (46 of 1959)

institution of a provident fund for the general public.  
The Government Savings Bank Act, 1873, the Government Savings Certificates Act, 
1959 (46 of 1959) and the Public Provident Fund Act, 1968(23 of 1968) broadly relate to 
saving instruments. The Law Commission of India in its One Hundred and Fifty-ninth 
Report has recommended for merger of the Government Savings Bank Act, 1873 and 
Government Savings Certificates Act, 1959 with the Public Provident Fund Act, 1968.  
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Acts may be repealed 
and re-enacted as a single legislation 	
with suitable modifications in today's socio- 
economic context.

GROUP - VI 
LABOUR LAWS 
Broadly, the Labour Laws can be classified under the categories, 
specified in the Annexure to this Chapter. 
REPORT OF NATIONAL COMMISSION ON LABOUR 
The Second National Commission on Labour was constituted by the Resolution of the 
Government of India No. Z-20014/8/99-Coord dated 15th October, 1999 (Refer Volume-IV 
Part I) and the Terms of Reference of the said Commission inter alia included to take into 
account the emerging economic environment involving rapid technological changes, 
requiring response in terms of change in methods, timings and conditions of work in industry, 
trade and services, globalisation of economy, liberilisation of trade and industry and emphasis 
538 
on international competitiveness and the need for bringing the existing laws in tune with the 
future labour market needs and demands.  
The Second National Commission on Labour gave its Report consisting of two 
volumes i.e. Volume consisting 1467 pages and volume 2 consisting of 284 pages.  
Chapter IV of the aforesaid Report 	
exclusively 	
dealt with the Globalization and 
economic reforms. The National Commission on Labour (at page 310 of Vol. 1 of the Report) 
observers that the legal system should therefore promote bilateralism. Both parties must take 
up the responsibilities that devolve on them in bilateralist attempts to protect each other's 
interests and of society of which both are parts. Where differences persist in spite of genuine 
bilateral attempts, the law must enable contending views to be settled through mediation and 
arbitration, including compulsory arbitration where the disputes may lead to disruption of 
social life affecting public health, sanitation, drinking water supply, medical facilities and 
transport, and cause suffering to large sections of people who are unrelated to the disputes.  
The Second National Commission on Labour at paras 10.72 and 10.73 of the Vol. 2 of 
the Report (Refer Volume-IV, Part I) recommended that the ITIs need to run market-driven 
courses, review and if necessary, revise curriculum every 5 years to keep it contemporary; 
give refresher training on new technologies and tools to teachers at ITIs and discontinue 
obsolete (not required by market) courses. 10.73 Further, to ensure effective involvement of 
industry in the training process, we recommend that some ITIs may be selected, on a pilot 
basis, for development into institutes of Excellence. They should be managed jointly with the 
industry.  
The aforesaid Report gave lot of emphasis on the exemption of laws to the small 
scale industries under Chapter and also gave a draft Bill in Appendix — II to the to Chapter V

LAWS RELATING TO FOREIGNERS/MATTERS 
RELATED TO THEM 
59.The Registration of Foreigners Act, 1939 (XVI of 1939) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the registration of foreigners in 
India. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No.85 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed inter alia stated that the aforesaid 	
Act is largely ineffective since there is no fool 
proof way of tracking whether all foreigners entering India are reporting themselves at all the 
required points. The Act has become a tool for harassing foreigners, and is damaging India's 
reputation as a welcoming tourist destination. Anecdotal evidence and newspaper reports cite 
long waiting lines, unclear instructions and frustrating bureaucracy, demands for bribes, and 
sexual harassment on account of this Act. In addition, cases alleging harassment of persons 
living on the borders under this Act have been reported from time to time. The Foreigners 
Act, 1946 and the Passport Act, 1967 provide sufficient powers to keep track of foreigners. 
Section 3 of the Foreigners Act empowers the government to issue orders prohibiting, 
regulating and restricting the entry of foreigners into India. Section 12 of the Passport Act 
makes failure to produce travel documents on demand by prescribed authorities and to 
comply with the conditions laid down in these documents a criminal offence. The 
government is further empowered, under Section 10, of the Passport Act to vary, impound or 
revoke any travel document for conviction under any offence. While the Passport Act 
provides reasonable opportunity to an aggrieved person to seek relief through appeal and 
provides protection at the time of arrest, search and seizure, the 1939 Act provides no such 
relief. Instead, it reverses the burden of proof upon the accused instead of the prosecution, 
544 
increasing chances of harassment. It further stated that there are no legal issues that would 
impede repeal.  
The provision of the aforesaid Act may be revisited alongwith the provisions of 
the Foreigners Act, 1946 (31 of 1943) and if considered necessary, one single legislation 
could be brought forward to deal with the matters related to both the Acts.

of entry of foreigners into, their presence therein and their departure there from. Subsequent 
to that the Citizenship Act, 1955 and the Passport Act, 1967 were enacted and also the 
Overseas Citizenship of India scheme was launched. In view of the subsequent legislation, 
the Committee feels that the Foreigners Act, 1946 needs to be revisited and the provisions 
which would be harmonious to the later enactments be enacted so as to avoid any conflicting 
provision among these three enactments.  
64.The Foreigners Law (Application and Amendment) Act, 1962 
(42 of 1962)  
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to apply the Registration of Foreigners Act, 1939 
and the Foreigners Act, 1946 to certain persons to whom they do not at present apply and 
further to amend the Foreigners Act, 1946.  
65.The Passport Act, 1967 (15 of 1967)  
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the issue of passports and travel 
documents to regulate the departure from India of citizens of India and other persons and for 
matters incidental or ancillary thereto.

BOCW(RECS) Act. 
To empower the Central Government to specify the maximum cost of 
construction which shall fall within the definition of establishment under 
clause (j) of sub-section (1) of section 2 of BOCW (RECS) Act. 
The existing condition of ninety days work certificate for registration 
under the BOCW (RECS) Act is a major handicap. Workers are finding it 
difficult to register themselves with the Workers Welfare Board as they do not 
get ninety days work certificate from the employer on account of migration 
from one site to another construction site. Most of the employers employing 
building and other construction workers do not give any certificate to the 
construction workers. In order to overcome this difficulty the provision of 
engagement of ninety days requires to be done away with. Moreover, the 
criteria of upper age limit of sixty years is proposed to be done away with in 
order to extend benefits to the workers who are engaged in building and 
construction work after attaining the age of sixty years. 
In many States the Welfare Board has not been constituted with its full 
manpower. It is proposed that till such time a Board is formally constituted by 
the State Government as stipulated under section 18, the following committee 
shall perform all or any function of the Board: 
­ 
Principal Secretary/ Secretary Labour; 
­ 
Principal Secretary/ Secretary Finance or his representative; 
­ 
Principal Secretary/ Secretary Planning or his representative; 
­ 
Principal Secretary/ Secretary Social Welfare or his representative; 
As per sub-section (3) of section 24 of the BOCW(RECS) Act, 1996 a 
ceiling of five percent of the expenditure has been prescribed for incurring 
expenditure towards salaries, allowances and other remunerations to the 
members, officers and other employees and administrative expenses of the 
Board. 
In view of the recommendations of the Central Advisory Committee, it 
is proposed that expenses for meeting administrative and other expenses shall 
not exceed such percentage of total expenses as may be notified by the Central 
Government. 
It is proposed to empower the Central Government to appoint such number 
of Director Generals not exceeding ten to coordinate with the Central 
Government in carrying out its responsibility of laying down the standard of 
inspection and to exercise the power of an Inspector. 
The definition of the 'employer' has not been incorporated in BOCW Welfare 
Cess Act. This needs to be included as given in the main Act. 
It is proposed to provide a period of 30 days to deposit the cess to the 
Board under Section 3 of the BOCW Welfare Cess Act. At present, no time 
limit has been prescribed under the present provisions. 
It is proposed to include the State Governments under sub-section 3 of 
564 
Section 12 of the BOCW Welfare Cess Act so as to enable the State 
Governments to file complaints for contravention of the provisions of the Act. 
The Bill was referred to the Standing Committee on Labour for 
examination and report. 	
The Committee, after deliberation with the Ministry 
and other stakeholders, presented its report to the Hon'ble Speaker, Lok Sabha 
on 15th  March, 2014.

proposal is to(i) ensure same wages

for provision for agreement between the contractor and the Principal Employer 
in respect of wages and social security. 
Under the proposal the provision under rule 25 sub para (v)( a) of para 2 was 
to be brought to the main act and included as section 16 A of the Act. The 
proposed section 16A will be read as 
Wages.  "In case where the contract labour perform the same or similar kind of 
work as the workmen directly appointed by the Principal Employer the wage 
rates, holidays, social security provisions of contract labour shall be the same 
as are available to the directly appointed workmen on the rolls of the Principal.

The administrative Ministry may take steps for repeal and re-enactment of the

Dangerous Epidemic Disease. 
Section 2A of the aforesaid Act confers powers upon the Central Government for 
taking measures in the case of outbreak of dangerous epidemic diseases. The aforesaid 
section 2A reads as under: 
"2A. When the Central Government is satisfied that India or any part thereof is visited by, or 
threatened with, an outbreak of any dangerous epidemic disease and that the ordinary provisions of 
the law for the time being in force are insufficient to prevent the outbreak of such disease or the spread 
thereof; the Central Government may take measures and prescribe regulations for the inspection

with both. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has recommended for its repeal at Sl. No. 133 of 
Appendix A-1 (166 Central Acts recommended for repeal). 
The Committee has deliberated on the repeal of this Act and feels that it needs 
to be re-enacted in view of today's socio-economic context than repealing it straight 
away as recommended by the P.C. Jab Commission. 
9.The Indian Post Office Act, 1898 (6 of 1898) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to consolidate and amend the law relating to the

September, 2014 [Refer Volume-HP Part I] has informed that the aforesaid Act is in force 
and would require revisiting/amendment as a whole in the light of changing business 
environment and IT modernization project currently under implementation 
The Committee feels that in today's socio-economic context, the infrastructure 
of the post offices can be used for the purposes of making available the various 
products of savings and social security and pension (such as insurance policies, pension 
products, saving instruments) to the citizens of India residing in the rural areas, where 
the companies are reluctant to open their offices due to economic reasons and the 
aforesaid Cat may be re-enacted in the light of present socio-economic context. 
10. The Live-stock Importation Act, 1898 (IX of 1898) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to make better provision for the regulation of the 
importation of live-stock. By efflux of time, the Act lost its relevance and needs to be 
repealed. P.C. Jain Commission has recommended for its repeal at SI. No. 1 of Appendix-A-
1 (166 Central Acts to be repealed by the Central Government). The Law Commission of 
India in its 248th Report has also recommended for its repeal at Sl. No.38 under Chapter 4 of 
the Report.. 
The Agricultural Bio-security Bill, 2013 was introduced in the Lok Sabha to provide 
for establishment of an Authority for prevention, control, eradication and management of 
pests and diseases of plants and animals and unwanted organisms for ensuring agricultural 
571 
bio-security and to meet international obligations of India for facilitating imports and exports 
of plants, plant products, animals, animal products, aquatic organisms and regulation of 
agriculturally important micro organisms and for matters connected therewith or incidental 
thereto. 
Sub-clause (1) of clause 80 of the said Bill proposes to repeal the Destructive Insects 
and Pests Act, 1914 and the Livestock Importation Act, 1898. The Hon'ble Standing 
Committee of Parliament also reported on the Agricultural Bio-security Bill, 2013. The said 
Bill could not be passed during the 15th Lok Sabha and it lapsed on the dissolution of 15th 
Lok Sabha 
The Department of Agriculture and Cooperation vide its OM No. 35-13/2014- 
O&M/PG dated 15th Sep, 2014[Refer Volume-III, Part I] stated that the Act had been 
revisited and a comprehensive Bill, namely, The Agricultural Bio Security Bill, 2013 was 
introduced in Lok Sabha on 11.03.2014. Clause 80 of the Agricultural Bio Security Bill, 
2013 proposed to repeal the Destructive Insects and Pests Act, 1914 and Live-stock 
Importation Act, 1898. The Bill lapsed with the dissolution of the 15thLokSabha. They 
further stated that a fresh Bill, namely, the Agricultural Bio Security Bill, 2014 is proposed 
to be introduced in this regard. 
The Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries vide its O.M. No.25- 
1(79)/2014-ADF/AR dated 17th Sep, 2014[Refer Volume-III, Part I] 
has inter alio 
conveyed that the Livestock Importation Act is an active /live Act which regulates, restricts 
or prohibits import of livestock and livestock products to prevent ingress of exotic diseases 
that may affect human and animal health. It was amended in 2001 to include livestock 
products within its ambit. The same is called as Livestock Importation (Amendment) Act, 
2001. therefore, for import of livestock products continuation of the act essential. They 
further stated in the aforesaid O.M. that all provisions of the Act are in force. There is no 
requirement of amendment of the Act as on date. 
There appears to be contrary views between the Department of Agriculture and 
Cooperation as conveyed vide its OM No. 35-13/2014-O&M/PG dated 15th Sep, 2014 
[Refer Volume-III, Part I] and Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries as 
conveyed vide its O.M. No.25-1(79)/2014-ADF/AR dated 17th Sep, 2014 referred above 
The Committee has considered the matter and feels that the administrative Ministry 
may re-visit the provisions of the Agricultural Bio-Security Bill, 2014 and take immediate 
steps for enactment of a new legislation to replace the Destructive Insects and Pests Act, 
1914 which has been existing for about one hundred years and outlived its utility. 
The Committee feels that the Ministry of Agriculture may consider re-
introduction of the Agricultural Bio-security Bill, 2014 in the ensuing session of 
Parliament to repeal the aforesaid Act with such modification as may be considered 
necessary. 
11. The Government Buildings Act, 1899 (IV of 1899) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the exemption from the operation 
of municipal building laws of certain buildings and lands which are the property, or in the 
occupation, of the Government and situate within the limits of a municipality. This Act was 
passed by the Governor General of India in Council and received the assent of the Governor 
General on the 3rd February, 1899. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has also recommended for its repeal at Sl. No.114 of 
Annexure A-5 (114 Central Acts recommended for repeal by States). 
Section 3 of the aforesaid Act contains provisions for exemption of certain 
Government buildings from municipal laws to regulate any building used or required for 
the public service or for any public purpose, which is the property, or in the occupation, of 
the Government, or which is to be erected on land which is the property, or in the 
572 
occupation, of the Government. However, section 4 confers powers upon the municipal 
authority, or any person authorized by it in this behalf to inspect the land and building (not 
being a building connected with defence or a building the plan or construction of which 
ought, in the opinion of the Government concerned, to be treated as confidential or 
secret), subject to certain restrictions contained in that section and all plans connected with 
erection, re-erection, construction of such building or material structural alteration, as the 
case may be, and to submit to the State Government a statement in writing of any 
objections or suggestions which such municipal authority may deem fit to make with 
reference to such erection, re-erection, construction or material structural alteration. 
Extracts of section 3 and 4 of the aforesaid Act are as under:— 
Exemption of certain Government buildings from municipal laws to regulate the erection, etc., of 
buildings within municipalities. 
"3.Nothing contained in any law or enactment for the time being in force to regulate the erection, 
re-erection, construction, alteration or maintenance of buildings within the limits of any 
municipality shall apply to any building used or required for the public service or for any public 
purpose, which is the property, or in the occupation, of the Government, or which is to be erected 
on land which is the property, or in the occupation, of the Government: 
Provided that, where the erection, re-erection, construction or material structural alteration 
of any such building as aforesaid (not being a building connected with defence, or a building the 
plan or construction of which ought, in the opinion of the Government concerned, to be 
treated as confidential or secret) is contemplated, reasonable notice of the proposed work shall be 
given to the municipal authority before it is commenced. 
Objections or suggestions as to erection, etc., of certain Government buildings within 
municipalities, how to be made and dealt with. 
"4. (1) In the case of any such building as is mentioned in the last preceding section (not being a 
building connected with defence or a building the plan or construction of which ought, in the 
opinion of the Government concerned, to be treated as confidential or secret), the municipal 
authority, or any person authorized by it in this behalf, may, with the permission of the State 
Government previously obtained, but not otherwise, and subject to any restrictions or 
conditions which may, by general or special order, be imposed by the State Government, inspect the 
land and building and all plans connected with its erection, re-erection, construction or material 
structural alteration, as the case may be, and may submit to the State Government a statement in 
writing of any objections or suggestions which such municipal authority may deem fit to make 
with reference to such erection, re-erection, construction or material structural alteration. 
(2) Every objection or suggestion submitted as aforesaid shall be considered by the State 
Government, which shall, after such investigation (if any) as it shall think advisable, pass 
orders thereon, and the building referred to therein shall be erected, re-erected, constructed or 
altered, as the case may be, in accordance with such orders: 
Provided that, if the State Government overrules or disregards any such objection or 
suggestion as aforesaid, it shall give its reasons for so doing in writing.". 
In today's socio-economic environment, more and more services rendered by the 
Government are entrusted to the private sector, as such or under Public Private Partnership 
(PPP mode). The repeal of the aforesaid Act by the State Legislatures (as recommended by 
the P.C. Jain Commission) may be construed so as to bring the land and building used or 
required for the public service or for any public purpose, which is the property, or in the 
occupation, of the Government, or which is to be erected on land which is the 
property, or in the occupation, of the Government. (not being a building connected with 
defence or a building the plan or construction of which ought, in the opinion of the 
Government concerned, to be treated as confidential or secret), under the scope of 
Municipal Laws. . 
The Committee feels that instead of referring the aforesaid Act for repeal by the 
State Legislatures, it may be considered for re-visiting and re-enactment thereof. 
12. The Indian Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1908 (XIV of 1908) 
573 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the more speedy trial of certain 
offences, and for the prohibition of associations dangerous to the public peace. 
The Act provided for the speedy trial of certain offences, and for the prohibition of 
associations dangerous to the public peace. It was enacted to curb the growing nationalist 
movement in India. It in essence amends the law relating to public associations. However, as 
the law relating to associations is well defined under the Indian Penal Code, 1860, this law is 
not necessary. Neither is there any evidence of recent use. Hence, it should be repealed. 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at Sl. No. 63 under Chapter 2 of 
the Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act without referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission observed that the Act 
provided for the speedy trial of certain offences, and for the prohibition of associations 
dangerous to the public peace. It was enacted to curb the growing nationalist movement in 
India. It in essence amends the law relating to public associations. However, as the law 
relating to associations is well defined under the Indian Penal Code, 1860, this law is not 
necessary. Neither is there any evidence of recent use. Hence, it should be repealed. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act should be considered by the 
administrative Ministry for repeal and re-enactment in consultation with the Ministry 
of Home Affairs, which is administering the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1973. 
13. The Presidency-towns Insolvency Act, 1909 (III of 1909) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to amend the law of insolvency in the Presidency 
towns and the Town of Rangoon. In view of the socio-economic changes, the Act needs to 
be re-visited by the administrative Ministry (Ministry of Finance) to bring the same on par 
with the Provincial Insolvency Act, 1920 (V of 1920). 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act should be considered by the 
concerned Ministry for repeal and re-enactment. 
14. The MussalmanWakf Validating Act, 1913 (VI of 1913) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to declare the rights of Mussalmans to make 
settlements of property by way of "wakf' in favour of their families, children and 
descendants. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has recommended for its repeal at Si. No. 160 of 
Appendix A-1 (166 Central Acts recommended for repeal). 
The Legislative Department vide their D.O. No. 11(29)/2014-L.I dated the 12th 
September, 2014 stated that the aforesaid Act is required to be repealed as it appears to be of 
no relevance. 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at Si. No. 1 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. The Law Commission, inter alia, 
observed that the Mussalman Wakf Validating Act declared the rights of Mussalmans to 
make settlements of property by way of `wakf in favour of their families, children and 
descendants The Act declared that no such wakf shall be deemed invalid merely because the 
benefit reserved therein for the poor or of other religious, pious or a permanent nature is 
postponed until after the extinction of the family, children or descendants of the person 
creating the wakf. This Act was enacted to statutorily supersede the position taken by the 
Privy Council in Abdul Fata Mahomed Ishak v. Russomoy Dhur Cho-  wdhry [1894 (22) Cal 
619 (PC)] that a wakf for the family members though coupled with a gift to charity on the 
failure of the line of descendants is not one substantially for charity and so was invalid. The 
Mussalman Wakf Validating Act, 1930 clarified that the Mussalman Wakf Validating Act, 
1913 shall be deemed to apply to wakfs created before its commencement. Hence, the 
Validating Act of 1913 was given retrospective application by the 1930 Act. The Wakf Act, 
1995 has now been enacted to provide for the better administration of wakfs and for matters 
574 
connected therewith. The 1995 Act applies to all wakfs, whether created before or after the 
commencement of the Act. Private wakfs are considered valid by the Act of 1995. Hence, 
the purpose of the Validating Acts of 1913 and 1930 has been subsumed by the Act of 1995. 
Wakfs of a private nature created any time before 1995 are valid under the Wakf Act, 1995. 
The Central Government should repeal both the 1913 and the 1930 Acts. However, since the 
Validating Acts of 1913 and 1930 are still used to validate wakfs created before 1913, a 
provision saving the wakfs validated by these Acts should be inserted into the 1995 Act. This 
Act has also been recommended for repeal by the PC Jain Commission Report (Appendix A-
1) and by the Ministry of Minority Affairs in its letter No. 12/10/2014-Wakf dated 9th 
September 2014 to the Member Secretary, Law Commission of India. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act should be repealed in consultation 
with the Ministry of Minority Affairs, which is administering the Wakf Act, 1995 by 
making a provision in the aforesaid Act to validate the wakfs created under the present 
Act. 
15. The Destructive Insects and Pests Act, 1914 (II of 1914) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to prevent the introduction into British India of 
any insect fungus or other pest, which is or may be destructive to crops. The Agricultural 
Bio-security Bill, 2013 was introduced in the Lok Sabha to provide for establishment of an 
Authority for prevention, control, eradication and management of pests and diseases of 
plants and animals and unwanted organisms for ensuring agricultural bio-security and to 
meet international obligations of India for facilitating imports and exports of plants, plant 
products, animals, animal products, aquatic organisms and regulation of agriculturally 
important micro organisms and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. Sub-
clause (1) of clause 80 of the said Bill proposes to repeal the Destructive Insects and Pests 
Act, 1914 and the Livestock Importation Act, 1898. 	
The said Bill could not be passed 
during the 15th LokSabha and it lapsed on the dissolution of 15th Lok Sabha. 
The Law Commission of India in its 248th Report has also recommended for its 
repeal SI. No.42 under Chapter 4 of the Report observed that the aforesaid Act was enacted 
to prevent the introduction into and the transport from one State to another in India of any 
insects, fungus or other pest which may be destructive to crops. This Act was proposed to be 
repealed and replaced by the Agricultural Bio-security Bill, 2013, as was the case with the 
Live-stock Importation Act, 1898 [Item 35 on this list]. This law is out of date and should be 
repealed, however, new law must be enacted to govern the subject matter. 
The Committee feels that the Ministry of Agriculture may consider re-
introduction of the Agricultural Bio-security Bill, 2014 in the ensuing session of 
Parliament with such modifications as it may considered appropriate. 
16. The Destructive Insects and Pests (Amendment and Validation) Act, 
1992 (12 of 1992) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted further to amend the Destructive Insects and 
Pests Act, 1914. 	
The aforesaid came into force retrospectively from the 27th day of 
October, 1989. 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th Report at Sl. No.68 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission, inter alia, observed 
that the aforesaid Act amended the Destructive Insects and Pests Act, 1914. The 1914 Act 
has been recommended for repeal by the Law Commission of India in its 248th Report on 
Obsolete Laws: Warranting Immediate Repeal. This Act would no longer be relevant once 
the 1914 Act is repealed. Hence, the Central Government should repeal this Amendment and 
Validation Act of 1992 along with the 1914 Act. 
The Department of Agriculture and Cooperation vide its OM No. 35-13/2014- 
575 
O&M/PG dated 15th Sep, 2014 [Refer Volume-HP Part I] stated that the Act had been 
revisited and a comprehensive Bill, namely, The Agricultural Bio Security Bill, 2013 was 
introduced in Lok Sabha on 11.03.2014. Clause 80 of the Agricultural Bio Security Bill, 
2013 proposed to repeal the Destructive Insects and Pests Act, 1914 and Live-stock 
Importation Act, 1898. The Bill lapsed with the dissolution of the 15thLokSabha. They 
further stated that a fresh Bill, namely, the Agricultural Bio Security Bill, 2014 is proposed 
to be introduced in this regard.. 
The Ministry of Agriculture may incorporate necessary validation and savings 
in the aforesaid Agricultural Bio-security Bill, 2014 and repeal the aforesaid Act also 
while re-enacting the new law in the subject. 
17. The Poisons Act, 1919(XII of 1919) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to consolidate and amend the law regulating the 
importation, possession and sale of poisons throughout the British India. 
Due to scientific advancement and to suit to the present day necessity the Act needs 
to be re-enacted as to the present context. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act should be repealed and re-enacted 
by the concerned administrative Ministry. 
18. The Maintenance Orders Enforcement Act, 1921 (XVIII of 1921) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to facilitate the enforcement in British India of 
Maintenance Orders made in other parts of His Majesty's Dominions and Protectorates and 
vice versa. 
Now, continuation of this Act appears to be irrelevant and by efflux of time, this Act 
lost its relevance and needs to be repealed. 
The Legislative Department vide their D.O. No. 11(29)/2014-L.I dated the 12th 
September, 2014 stated that the Law Commission in its 148th Report recommended for 
repeal. But Legislative Department have stated that the aforesaid Act would require Re- 
enactment and repeal is required in the light of existing legal regime 
In view of the above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act may be re- 
visited, repealed and re-enacted in the light of socio-economic and legal system. 
19. The Mussalman Wakf Act, 1923 (XLII of 1923) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to make provision for the better management of 
wakf property and for ensuring the keeping and publication of proper accounts in respect of 
such properties. The provisions of may be carried out into 1995 Act, which is a consolidated 
law on the subject. 
The Legislative Department vide their D.O. No. 11(29)/2014-L.I dated the 12th 
September, 2014 [Refer Volume HI,  Part-I] stated that the aforesaid Act is required to be 
repealed as it appears to be of no relevance. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act should be repealed in consultation 
with the Ministry of Minority Affairs, which is administering the Wakf Act, 1995 by 
making a provision in the aforesaid Act to validate the wakfs created under the present 
Act. 
20. The Indian Boilers Act, 1923 (V of 1923) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to consolidate and amend the law relating to 
steam-boilers. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Si. No.87 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed inter alia stated that the Act gives widespread powers to the inspectors, 
encouraging rent seeking. In order to avoid inspection, some industrial units resorted to 
using boilers with capacities below the regulatory limits. There was also reported to be a 
shortage of inspectors, due to which many boilers could not be registered, leading to the 
576 
shutting down of many units. This led to an amendment in the law in 2007 (notified in 2010) 
providing for third party certification and audit, in order to ease the situation. Self-
Certification Schemes could be a better alternative. In June 2014, the Commerce and 
Industry Ministry asked for a repeal of the Act and moving towards a system of self-
certification. States like Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have already formulated 
Self-Certification cum Annual Consolidated Return Schemes, in order to curtail unnecessary 
inspections without compromising on the provisions of health, safety and welfare of the 
workers. Under the Scheme, an owner of a boiler unit may opt for self-certification by 
agreeing to abide by certain undertakings and filing of annual returns to the concerned 
authority; and giving a security deposit. Where the owner fails to file annual returns in time 
or fails to follow the terms and conditions of the Scheme, the security deposit is forfeited. 
The concerned authority randomly picks around 10% of the units enrolled under the Scheme 
for inspection once a year. Once inspected, the unit is not likely to be inspected in the same 
year or the next three years, unless specific violations are brought to the notice of the 
authorities. It further stated that aforesaid Act has created the posts of Inspectors, Deputy 
Chief Inspectors and Chief Inspectors to implement the provisions of the Act. There is also 
an Appellate Authority existing under the Act. 
The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion 
vide 
their D.O 
No.34011/13/2014-0&M dated the 19th September, 2014, did not find favour for repeal of 
the aforesaid Act [Refer Volume III, Part-I]. 
Since, more than ninety years have elapsed since enactment of the aforesaid Act, 
the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act may be re-visited, repealed and re-enacted 
in socio-economic context and technological advances. 
21. The Hindu Gains of Learning Act, 1930 (XXX of 1930) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to remove doubt as to the rights of a member of a 
Hindu undivided family in property acquired by him by means of his learning. This Act was 
passed by the Indian Legislature and received the assent of the Governor General on the 25th 
July, 1930. 
The Legislative Department vide their D.O. No. 11(29)/2014-L.I dated the 12th 
September, 2014 stated that re-enactment and repeal of the Act is required in the light of 
changing socio-economic environment and existing laws. 
Attention is invited to section 3 of the aforesaid Act which reads as under:— 
[3.Gains of learning not to be held, not to be separate property of acquirer merely for certain reasons.-
Notwithstanding any custom, rule or interpretation of the Hindu Law, no gains of learning shall be 
held not to be the exclusive and separate property of the acquirer merely by reason of- 
(a) his learning having been, in whole or in part, imparted to him by any member, living or 
deceased, of his family, or with the aid of the joint funds of his family, or with the aid of the funds of 
any member thereof, or 
(b) himself or his family having, while he was acquiring his learning, been maintained or 
supported, wholly or in part, by the joint funds of his family, or by the funds of any member 
thereof.] 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act may be considered for review and 
re-enactment in view of the Socio- Economic Changes. 
22. The MussalmanWakf Validating Act, 1930 (XXXII of 1930) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to give retrospective effect to the Mussalman 
Wakf Validating Act, 1913. The MussalmanWakf Validating Act, 1913 was enacted to 
declare the rights of Mussalmans to make settlements of property by way of "wakr in favour 
of their families, children and descendants. The Mussalman Wakf Validating Act, 1930 
gives retrospective effect to the 1913 Act. 
The P.C. Jain Commission has recommended for its repeal at Sl. No. 161 of 
577 
Appendix A-1 (166 Central Acts recommended for repeal). 
The Legislative Department vide their D.O. No. 11(29)/2014-L.I dated the 12th 
September, 2014 stated that the aforesaid Act is required to be repealed as it appears to be of 
no relevance. 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at Sl. No. 1 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. The Law Commission, inter alia, 
observed that the Mussalman Wakf Validating Act declared the rights of Mussalmans to 
make settlements of property by way of `wakc in favour of their families, children and 
descendants. The Act declared that no such wakf shall be deemed invalid merely because the 
benefit reserved therein for the poor or of other religious, pious or a permanent nature is 
postponed until after the extinction of the family, children or descendants of the person 
creating the wakf. This Act was enacted to statutorily supersede the position taken by the 
Privy Council in Abdul Fata Mahomed Ishak v. Russomoy Dhur Chowdhry [1894 (22) Cal 
619 (PC)] that a wakf for the family members though coupled with a gift to charity on the 
failure of the line of descendants is not one substantially for charity and so was invalid. The 
Mussalman Wakf Validating Act, 1930 clarified that the Mussalman Wakf Validating Act, 
1913 shall be deemed to apply to wakfs created before its commencement. Hence, the 
Validating Act of 1913 was given retrospective application by the 1930 Act. The Wakf Act, 
1995 has now been enacted to provide for the better administration of wakfs and for matters 
connected therewith. The 1995 Act applies to all wakfs, whether created before or after the 
commencement of the Act. Private wakfs are considered valid by the Act of 1995. Hence, 
the purpose of the Validating Acts of 1913 and 1930 has been subsumed by the Act of 1995. 
Wakfs of a private nature created any time before 1995 are valid under the Wakf Act, 1995. 
The Central Government should repeal both the 1913 and the 1930 Acts. However, since the 
Validating Acts of 1913 and 1930 are still used to validate wakfs created before 1913, a 
provision saving the wakfs validated by these Acts should be inserted into the 1995 Act. This 
Act has also been recommended for repeal by the PC Jain Commission Report (Appendix A-
1) and by the Ministry of Minority Affairs in its letter No. 12/10/2014-Wakf dated 9th 
September 2014 to the Member Secretary, Law Commission of India. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act should be repealed in consultation 
with the Ministry of Minority Affairs, which is administering the Wakf Act, 1995 by 
making a provision in the aforesaid Act to validate the wakfs created under the present 
Act. 
23.The Agriculture Produce (Grading and Marketing) Act, 1937 
The Department of Agriculture and Cooperation vide its OM No. 35-13/2014-
O&M/PG dated the 15th September, 2014 [Refer Volume III, Part-I]. stated that the 
aforesaid requires revisiting. It has been further stated that a committee, under the 
Chairmanship of Jt. Agriculture Marketing Adviser, Directorate of Marketing & Inspection, 
Ministry of Agriculture is being constituted which will revisit the Act and the General 
Grading & Marking Rules, 1988 (as amended upto 2009) framed there under and give its 
recommendations within one month. 
The Committee feels that the recommendations of the aforesaid Committee may 
be expeditiously processed. 
24. The Scheduled Securities (Hyderabad) Act, 1949 (VII of 1949) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the control of the transfer of 
certain securities and for the issue of duplicate securities in respect thereof. The aforesaid 
Act was passed by the Dominion Legislature and received the assent of the Governor 
General on the 16th February, 1949. 
The P.C. Jain Commission in its Report at SI. No. 89 of Appendix A-5 (114 Central 
578 
Acts recommended for repeal by State Government) had recommended for repeal of the 
aforesaid Act. 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at Sl. No. 17 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission, inter alia, observed 
that the aforesaid Act provided for the control of the transfer of certain securities and for the 
issue of duplicate securities in respect thereof. The Act provided that the Reserve Bank of 
India shall not, without the approval in writing of the Central Government, recognise for any 
purpose any transfer of a scheduled security otherwise than to the Government of Hyderabad 
made or purported to have been made on or before 31st December 1948. Such security was 
deemed to have been vested in the Government of Hyderabad. This Act has served its 
purpose and the Central Government should now repeal this Act. A suitable savings clause 
should be inserted in the repealing Act. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed in consultation with 
the concerned Ministry and the Reserve Bank of India after making a specific saving 
clause. 
25. The West Godavari District (Assimilation of Laws on Federal Subject) 
Act, 1949 (20 of 1949) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to assimilate certain laws in force in different 
parts of the West Godavari District of the Province of Madras. The aforesaid Act was passed 
by the Dominion Legislature and received the assent of the Governor General on the 14th 
April, 1949. 
The P.C. Jain Commission in its Report at Si. No. 108 of Appendix A-1 (166 Central 
Acts recommended for repeal) had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at Sl. No. 18 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission, inter alia, observed 
that the aforesaid Act assimilated certain laws in force in different parts of the West 
Godavari district of the Province of Madras. The Act prescribed that, on the appointed day as 
specified under the Act, all laws in force in the Eluru Taluk (a taluk in the West Godavari 
district) would extend to the scheduled areas (this refers to areas which find mention in the 
Schedule appended to the Act, and not to Scheduled Areas under the Constitution). 
Simultaneously, all laws in force in the scheduled areas would cease to be in force. The 
purpose of this Act has now been fulfilled. Hence, the Central Government should repeal this 
Act. 
The Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 (6 of 2014) has been enacted and 
subsequently amendments have been made thereto by the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation 
(Amendment) Act, 2014 (20 of 2014) transferring certain parts of State of Telengana to 
Andhra Pradesh. Some of the areas mentioned in Schedule to the West Godavari District 
(Assimilation of Laws on Federal Subject) Act, 1949 are covered under the said the Andhra 
Pradesh Reorganisation (Amendment) Act, 2014. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the concerned Ministry in 
consultation with the States of Andhra Pradesh and Telengana consider the repeal of 
the aforesaid Act with appropriate saving if required in case the matter is not sub- 
judice. 
26. The Merged States (Laws) Act, 1949 (59 of 1949) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to extend certain laws to certain areas 
administered as parts of Governor's Provinces or as Chief Commissioners Provinces. The 
aforesaid Act was passed by the Dominion Legislature and received the assent of the 
Governor General on the 26th December, 1949. 
579 
The P.C. Jain Commission in its Report at SI. No. 117 of Appendix A-1 (166 Central 
Acts recommended for repeal) had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at Si. No. 19 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission, inter alia, observed 
that the aforesaid Act extended certain laws to certain areas administered as parts of 
Governor's Provinces or as Chief Commissioner's Provinces. The Act listed certain Acts in 
its Schedule and extended those Acts to the new provinces constituted by the States' Merger 
(Chief Commissioner's Provinces) Order, 1949. The Act is now redundant as Governor's or 
Chief Commissioner's Provinces have ceased to exist. Hence, the Central Government 
should repeal this Act. 
Since, the aforesaid Act extends certain laws to the parts of the erst while provinces 
and has become redundant by efflux of time. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed in consultation with 
the Ministry of Home Affairs and concerned States. 
27. The State Bank of Samastha Act, 1950 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th Report at Si. No. 21 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. The Law Commission, inter alia, 
observed that the text of the aforesaid Act is not available on the Law Ministry's website, or 
from any other readily available source, an indication that it is not in use. Neither are there 
any other documented instances where this Act has been used in the last few decades. 
Therefore, the Central Government should repeal this law after consultation with the State 
Bank of India. 
The Committee perused the Central Acts from the year 1834 to till date and could not 
find an Act titled as "the State Bank of Samastha Act, 1950". However, the State Bank of 
Saurashtra (Repeal) and the State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) Amendment Act, 2009 
(48 of 2009) was enacted which, inter alia, repealed the State Bank of Saurashtra Act, 1950. 
In view of above, the Legislative Department may in consultation with the 
concerned Department may take a view about the repeal of the aforesaid Act. 
28.The Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 (59 of 1958) 
The aforesaid Act was repealed by the Delhi Rent Act, 1995, which has been enacted 
to provide for the regulation of rents, repairs and maintenance and eviction relating to 
premises and of rates of hotels and lodging houses in the National Capital Territory of Delhi. 
The aforesaid Act received assent of the President on 23rd August, 1995. Sub-sections 
(3) of section 1 confers powers on the Central Government to bring into force on such date 
as it may by notification in the official Gazette appoint. As per record made available to the 
Committee, the aforesaid Act has not been brought into force. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No.75 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed inter alia stated that the aforesaid Act has very limited scope in so far as it exempts 
government property, upper bracket housing where rent exceeds Rs. 3500 and slums. Hence, 
regulation is limited to rental spaces for lower income groups. Two, the Act fixes a standard 
rent (which is as low as Rs. 600 per month in certain cases), and permits revision of the 
standard rent by 10eviction of tenants is stringent and strictly monitored, and rarely can 
landlords extricate their property from the grip of this rent policy. As a result, renting of 
property is a very low return business for landlords, discouraging them from repairing and 
maintaining their property. It also dis-incentivises prospective landlords from entering the 
rental market. Consequently, there is an artificial scarcity of rental housing. The difficulty 
that the Act poses in allowing landlords to get rented property vacated abet illegality and 
litigation and create a flourishing black market. In sum, the Act runs counter to its intentions 
and ends up being both anti-tenant and anti-landlord, adversely affecting accessibility and 
580 
availability of affordable housing for lower income groups in urban areas. The Task Force on 
Rental Housing under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation, Government 
of India, in its Report on Policy and Interventions to Spur Growth of Rental Housing in 
India, March 2013, has recommended simple contract-based Lease/Rent agreements between 
willing renters and willing tenants, without the State imposing draconian price controls that 
in effect drive away legitimate renters and force tenants to enter into unrecorded and 
informal arrangements that are detrimental to their interests. It further stated that the Delhi 
Rent Act, 1995 (providing for repeal of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958), seeking to 
marginally ease rent control policy, was passed by Parliament (in 1995). However, the Act 
was never notified, due to severe resistance by tenancy groups. Consequently, the 1958 Act 
continues to operate, despite approval for its repeal by the Parliament. In 2013, the 
Government introduced the Delhi Rent Repeal Bill for repeal of the 1995 Act to bring about 
a more comprehensive law. The Bill is pending in Rajya Sabha. Repeal of the Act will 
impact pending litigation. This can be addressed by enacting a saving clause. 
The Delhi Rent (Repeal) Bill, 2013 has been introduced in the Rajya Sabha. The 
Committee feels that the Bill for repeal and re-enactment can be introduced after 
withdrawal of the Delhi Rent (Repeal) Bill, 2013 with the leave of the Rajya Sabha. 
The administrative Ministry may also take a view on the suggestion made in the 
preceding paragraph by the Centre for Civil Society. 
29. The Legal Practitioners Act, 1879. (XVIII of 1879) 
The aforesaid Act consolidates and amend the law relating to legal practitioners. 
The aforesaid Act has become obsolete in view of the enactment of Advocates Act, 1961. 
P.C. Jain Commission also recommended for its repeal at SI. No. 69 under Appendix A-1 
(166 Central Acts recommended for repeal). 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at SI. No. 38 under Chapter 2 of 
the Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act after making suitable 
amendments to the Advocates Act, 1961 referring to the earlier recommendations of the P.C. 
Jain Commission. The Law Commission observed that the aforesaid law was enacted to 
consolidate all the rules relating to the enrolment, conduct, and service of legal practitioners. 
However, after the coming into force of the Advocates Act, 1961, all the provisions of the 
Act stand 24 repealed with the exception of Sections I, 3 and 36. While Sections 1 and 3 are 
the title clause and the interpretation clause respectively, Section 36 empowers the High 
Courts to frame a list of touts, and prescribes the punishment for touting. These provisions 
can be incorporated into the Advocates Act, 1961 by means of a suitable amendment, so that 
the entire law on this subject can be found in one place. After making amendments to the 
Advocates Act, 1961, this Act should be repealed. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No.82 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed inter alia stated that the Advocates Act, 1961 has almost entirely replaced this Act, 
doing away with all but three sections that together empower High Courts to deal with touts. 
It is now the 1961 Act that regulates legal practitioners in India, and sets up the Bar Council 
to regulate matters such as enrolment and disciplinary action. Over time, all the provisions of 
the 1879 law were repealed except Sections 1, 3 and 36. These sections consist of the title 
clause, interpretation clause, the power of High Courts to frame a list of touts, and the 
punishment for touting. These provisions can easily be incorporated into the 1961 Act, so 
that the entire law on this subject can be found in one place. It further stated that the 
provisions in the Legal Practitioners Act empowering courts to deal with touts can be moved 
to the Advocates Act in order to remove this law from the statute books. 
Attention is drawn to sub-section (5)of section 50 of the Advocates Act, 1961, 
which reads as under:— 
"(5). When the whole of this Act has come into force- 
581 
(a) the remaining provisions of the Acts referred to in this section which do not stand repealed by 
virtue of any of the foregoing provisions of this section [except sections 1, 3 and 36 of the Legal 
Practitioners Act, 1879 (18 of 1879)] shall stand repealed; 
(b) the enactments specified in the Schedule shall stand repealed to the extent mentioned therein.". 
As per the information made available to the Committee, all the provisions of 
the Advocate Act, 1961 have come into force. The last notification number S.O. 1349 
(E) dated the 9th June, 2011 brought into force section 30 of the Advocates Act, 1961. 
In view of the above, the Committee feels that the provisions of Legal Practitioners 
Act, 1879 stands repealed in part i.e, except sections 1, 3 and 36 of the Legal Practitioners 
Act, 1879 which are saved by sub-section (5) of section 50 of the Advocates Act, 1950. 
Sections 1, 3 and 36 of the Legal Practitioners Act, 1879 reads as under:- 
[1. Short title, commencement. This Act may be called the Legal Practitioners Act, 1879; and 
shall come into force on the first day of January, 1880. 
Local extent.- This section and section 2 extend to the whole of India except the State of Jammu and 
Kashmir. 
The rest of this Act extends, in the first instance, only to the territories which, immediately before 
the 1st November, 1956, were comprised in West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar, Madhya 
Pradesh, Assam, Orissa and Delhi. But the State Government of any State may, from time to time, 
by notification in the Official Gazette, extend all or any of the provisions of the rest of this Act to the 
whole or any part of that State to which such provisions extend. 
3. Interpretation-clause. In this Act, unless there be something repugnant in the subject or context,-
"Judge" means the presiding judicial officer in every Civil and Criminal Court, by whatever title he 
is designated: 
"subordinate Court" means all Courts subordinate to the High Court, including Courts of Small 
Causes established 	
under Act No. 9 of 1850 or Act No. 11 of 1865: 
"revenue-office" includes all Courts (other than Civil Courts) trying suits under any Act for the 
time being in force relating to land-holders and their tenants or 	
agents: 
"legal practitioner" means an advocate, vakil or attorney of any High Court, a pleader, mukhtar or 
revenue-agent: 
"tout" means a person- 
(a) who procures, in consideration of any remuneration moving from any legal 
practitioner, the employment of the legal practitioner in any legal business; or who proposes to any 
legal practitioner or to any person interested in any legal business to procure, in 
consideration of any remuneration moving from either of them, the employment of the legal 
practitioner in such business; or places or other places of public resort. 
(b) who for the purposes of such procurement frequents the precincts of Civil or Criminal Courts 
or of revenue- offices, or railway stations, landing stages, lodging. 
36. Power to frame and publish lists of touts. (I) Every High Court, District Judge, Sessions 
Judge, District Magistrate and Presidency Magistrate, every Revenue-officer, not being below the 
rank of a Collector of a district, and the Chief Judge of every Presidency Small Cause Court (each 
as regards their or his own Court and the Courts, if any, subordinate thereto) may frame and 
publish lists of persons proved to their or his satisfaction, or to the satisfaction of any subordinate 
Court as provided in sub-section (2A) by evidence of general repute or otherwise, habitually to act 
as touts, and may, from time to time, alter and amend such lists. 
Explanation.--The passing of a resolution, declaring any person to be or not to be a tout, by a 
majority of the members present at a meeting, specially convened for the purpose, of an association 
of persons entitled to practise as legal practitioners in any Court or revenue-office, shall be 
evidence of the general repute of such person for the purposes of this sub-section. 
(2) No person's name shall be included in any such list until he shall have had an opportunity of 
showing cause against such inclusion. 
582 
(2A) Any authority empowered under sub-section (1) to frame and publish a list of touts may 
send to any Court subordinate to such authority the names of any persons alleged or suspected to be 
touts, and order that Court to hold an inquiry in regard to such persons; and the subordinate Court 
shall thereupon hold an inquiry into the conduct of such persons and, after giving each such person 
an opportunity of showing cause as provided in sub-section (2), shall report to the authority which 
has ordered the inquiry the name of each such person who has been proved to the satisfaction of the 
subordinate Court to be a tout; and that authority may include the name of any such person in the list 
of touts framed and published by that authority: 
Provided that such authority shall hear any such person who, before his name has been so 
included, appears before it and desires to be heard. 
(3) A copy of every such list shall be kept hung up in every Court to which the same relates. 
 
(4) The Court or Judge may, by general or special order, exclude from the precincts of the Court 
any person whose name is included in any such list. 
(5) Every person whose name is included in any such list shall be deemed to be proclaimed as a 
tout within the meaning of section 13,clause (e), and section 22, clause (d). 
(6) Any person who acts as a tout whilst his name is included in any such list shall be 
punishable with imprisonment which may extend to three months, or with fine which may extend 
to five hundred rupees, or with both.] 
From the above, it can be concluded that the Legal Practitioners' Act, 1879 exist 
on the Statute Book only because of three sections i.e. , 1, 3 and 36. The Committee 
recommends that the aforesaid Act which is more than 135 years old should be 
repealed, in particular such Act being enacted during Colonial period and the 
provisions of the aforesaid sections, if required, may be incorporated in the Advocates 
Act, 1961. 
30.The Usurious Loans Act, 1918 (X of 1918) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to give additional powers to the Courts to deal in 
certain cases with usurious loans of money or in kind. 
The Committee feels that the provisions of the aforesaid Act to be revisited in 
today's socio -economic context and needs to be repealed in today's context and re-
enacted in the light of laws enacted and proposed to be enacted for self help 
groups/Khadi and Village Industries/Micro and Small Scale Industries with such 
modification and safeguards as may be necessary. 
31. The Cutchi Memons Act, 1938 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to that all the Cutchi Memons shall be governed in the 
matters of succession and inheritance by the Muhammadan Law. 
The P.C. Jain Commission in its Report at Si. No. 3 of Appendix-D to the Report has 
included the aforesaid Act for review. The Commission observed that there are number of 
personal laws applicable to some religions and communities. Some of these may not be 
relevant now and are also indeed very old. The perception of the concerned religion or 
community would be relevant for their updating/codification/repeal. The Commission 
recommends that further action be taken accordingly. 
The Legislative Department vide their D.O. No. 11(29)12014-L.1  dated the 12th 
September, 2014 stated that the aforesaid Act requires re-enactment and repeal of the Act in 
the light of changing socio-economic environment.[Refer Volume III, Part-I]. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act may be revisited for 
taking a considered view in the matter for re-enactment as suggested by the Legislative 
Department. 32.The Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 (23 of 1940) 
583 
The Department of AYUSH vide their D.O. No Z.28015/119/2014-P&C dated the 
12th September, 2014 have stated in their D.O. that the Drugs and Cosmetics (Amendment) 
Bill 2007 was withdrawn due to major changes recommended by the Parliamentary Standing 
Committee, it was suggested for a fresh amendment Bill exclusively for allopathic drugs and 
to delink the provisions for AYUSH drugs from the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. 
Accordingly, they have decided that the Department of AYUSH would bring a separate Bill 
at an appropriate time to enact a new Law for AYUSH Drugs and also move a separate 
Cabinet Note for introducing the Bill to amend the Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940. 
Thereafter, Ayurvedic, Siddha and Unani Drugs Technical Advisory Board in its meeting 
held in September 2013 recommended to set up a Committee for formulating the draft Bill 
for AYUSH drugs. 
The Department of AYUSH has set up a Committee of Experts to formulate the draft 
provisions of the Bill for enactment of regulatory provisions for Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, 
Sowa Rigpa and Homoeopathic drugs. 
The Department of AYUSH in their D.O. letter has confirmed that the Drugs and 
Cosmetics Act, 1940 requires revisiting till separate legislation is enacted for AYUSH drugs. 
They further stated that amendment in the existing Act and Rules there under would be 
required to provide for inclusion of more authoritative books in Schedule-1, establishment of 
proposed Central Drugs Controller of AYUSH and requirements for conduct of clinical 
trials. AYUSH-related provisions will be repealed from the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 
while enacting the new legislation for AYUSH drugs. 
The Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 provides to regulate the import, manufacture, 
distribution and sale of drugs and cosmetics. The aforesaid Act also inter alia provides 
provisions for maintenance of standards of drugs, prevention of adulterated drugs, spurious 
drugs, misbranded cosmetics, spurious cosmetics, prohibition of import of certain drugs, 
The Mashelkar Committee, which was appointed in January, 2003 submitted its 
Report in November, 2003. The aforesaid Committed inter alia had recommended a new 
structure for the Drug Regulatory System in the Country including the setting up of a 
National Drug Authority; measures to strengthen the drug regulatory infrastructure in Centre 
and States; evaluate the extent of spurious and sub-standard Drugs and recommend measures 
required to deal with the problem; the Committee observed that in India, because of 
numerous licensing authorities (State/UT's), the implementation of drugs laws has been 
weak and non-uniform even after 56 years of enforcement. It is well established that the 
regulatory infrastructure in many States is below par, while it is functioning better in some. 
This has resulted in lack of adequate confidence among the consumers and level playing 
field for industry. The Committee observed that the issue of non-uniformity of enforcement 
at the state level was serious and needs to be addressed immediately. The Committee records 
that there should have been a single agency to regulate the manufacture and quality control 
of drugs in the country and that it should be done centrally. The Committee had 
recommended in para 6.4 of its report for changes in the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and 
Rules specified therein. The Committee has dealt in detail in paragraph 8.0 of the Report 
extent of spurious and substandard drugs in the country and measures to deal with the 
problem. In paragraph 10.2 the Committee observed that by amendment of The Drugs and 
Cosmetics Act in 1982, punishments for various offences were rationalized and life 
imprisonment was included as penalty for sale and manufacture of a spurious drug that 
causes grievous hurt or death. It was, however, noted that so far not a single prosecution has 
resulted in life imprisonment. While some members of the Committee suggested that for real 
fear among the possible offenders the penalty should now be enhanced from life 
imprisonment to death, some others were of the view that legal proceeding in cases 
involving death penalty may result in very complicated and lengthy trials. It was also agreed 
584 
that even in cases of spurious drugs that are not likely to cause grievous hurt or death, the 
penalty should be enhanced with increased fine. The Committee recommends that the 
existing provisions under Section 27 of Drugs & 
Cosmetics Act need to be amended. 
The Mashelkar Committee revisited the penal provisions and recommended revised 
punishments in Annexure-13 of the said Report, which reads as follows: any drug deemed to 
be adulterated under Section 17-Aor spurious under Section 17-Band which when used by 
any person for or in the diagnosis, treatment, mitigation, or prevention of any disease or 
disorder is likely to cause his death or is likely to cause such harm on his body as would 
amount to grievous hurt within the meaning of Section 320 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 
1860), solely on account of such drug being adulterated or spurious, as the case may be, shall 
be punishable with death penalty or imprisonment for a term of life or imprisonment for a 
term which shall not be less than ten years and with fine of rupees one lakh or up to three 
times the value of the goods seized, whichever is higher. Where fine is realized, it shall be 
paid to the victim or next of his kin. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that there is immediate need to enact a new 
legislation by AYUSH and on the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 which was enacted 
seventy-four years ago in today's context in the advancement in the field of research in 
Drugs and globalisation as India developing as a Health Sector Hub and revisit the detailed 
Mashelkar Committee Report on the subject. The early repeal and re-enactment of the

33. The Delhi Restriction of Uses of Land Act, 1941 (12 of 1941) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to regulate in the Province of Delhi the use of 
land for purposes other than agricultural purposes. The aforesaid Act was passed by the 
Indian Legislature and received the assent of the Governor General on the 8th April, 1941. 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at SI. No. 11 under Chapter 2 of 
the Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act in consultation with the State 
Government of Delhi. The Law Commission, inter alia, observed that the Act regulated in 
the province of Delhi the use of land for purposes other than agricultural purposes. The Act 
authorised the Chief Commissioner of Delhi to declare certain areas to be 'controlled'. 
Previous permission of the Chief Commissioner was required for undertaking construction in 
such areas. The office of the Chief Commissioner of Delhi has ceased to exist. Also, the 
purpose of this Act has been subsumed because restrictions on the use of agricultural land 
are now imposed under Section 81 of the Delhi Land Reforms Act, 1954. There is no 
evidence of recent use of this Act. Therefore, the Central Government should repeal this Act 
after consulting the State Governments. 
In view of the above, the aforesaid Act can be repealed in consultation with the 
Ministry of Home Affairs and State Government of Delhi. 
34. The Rehabilitation Finance Administration Act, 1948 
(12 of 1948) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to establish the Rehabilitation Finance 
Administration. The aforesaid Act was passed by the Dominion Legislature and received 
the assent of the Governor General on the 23rd March, 1948. 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at Si. No. 13 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act in consultation with the State 
Government of Delhi. The Law Commission, inter alia, observed that the aforesaid Act 
established a Rehabilitation Finance Administration, for the purpose of giving financial 
assistance on reasonable terms to displaced persons to enable them to settle in business and 
industry. 'Displaced person' was defined as - i) a person who, being displaced from any area 
outside India on account of civil disturbances or fear of such disturbances, has settled and is 
585 
engaged or intends to engage in any business or industry in India, or ii) a person in India 
who, having had his business, industry or property, wholly or partially outside India, has 
lost, wholly or partially, such business, industry, or property on account of civil disturbances 
or the fear of such disturbances, and who is engaged, or intends to engage in any business or 
industry in India. There is no evidence from readily available sources to suggest that the 
Rehabilitation Finance Administration rendered any assistance after the culmination of the 
5th Five Year Plan (1974-1979). This Act has now fallen into disuse. Hence, the Central 
Government should ascertain the status of the Rehabilitation Finance Administration and 
consider repeal of this Act. 
By efflux of time, the aforesaid Act has become redundant in its application. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act can be repealed in 
consultation with the concerned administrative Ministry 
35. The Finance Commission (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1951 
(33 of 1951) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to determine the qualifications requisite for

Acts for repeal by the Central Government) for repeal of the aforesaid Act. 
The Department of Economic Affairs vide its O.M. No.11/47/2012-Ad.V dated 15 
September, 2014[Refer Volume III, Part-I] has stated that no specific reason for repeal of 
the said Act has been cited in the P.C. Jain Report and it is felt that the Act is still in 
harmony with extant provision under article 280(2) of the Constitution may not be prudent to 
repeal it. 
Clause (2) of article 280 of the Constitution may be read as under:— 
.[280.(2) Parliament may by law determine the qualifications which shall be requisite for appointment 
as members of the Commission and the manner in which they shall be selected.] 
The aforesaid Act inter alia contains provisions relating to Qualification for 
appointment as, and the manner of selections of members of the Commission, public interest 
of disqualify members, disqualification for being a member of the Commission, condition of 
service and salaries and allowances of members and procedure and powers of the

After the enactment of the aforesaid Act, article 280 has been amended in 1992 by 
the Constitution (Seventy-third Amendment) Act, 1992 and Constitution (Seventy-fourth 
Amendment) Act, 1992 which inserted clauses (bb), (c) and (d) in clause (3) of article 280 of 
the Constitution which reads as under:— 
[(bb) the measures needed to augment the Consolidated Fund of a State to 
supplement the resources of the Panchayats in the State on the basis of the 
recommendations made by the Finance Commission of the State; 
(c) the measures needed to augment the Consolidated Fund of a State to supplement 
the resources of the Municipalities in the State on the basis of the recommendations 
made by the Finance Commission of the State;] 
The duty of the Finance Commission was widened by the aforesaid amendment to 
the Constitution which inter alia included making of recommendations as to be measures 
mentioned in the clauses (bb) and (c) of clause (3) of article 280 relating for supplementing 
the resources of Panchayats and Municipalities of the State and 63 years have elapsed since 
enactment of the aforesaid Act. The aforesaid Act has been amended twice (by Act 13 of 
1955 and Act 4 of 1986) which relate to amendment of sub-section (2) of section 8 thereof 
strengthening the powers upon the finance Commission to obtain information and laying of 
rules before Parliament. Though, the role of the Finance Commission has been widened for 
586 
supplementing the resources of Panchayats and Municipalities of the State but the other 
provisions of the aforesaid Act (including the qualification of the members of the Finance 
Commission and manner of selection of members of the Commission and disqualification for 
being a member of the Commission) have not been amended. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act needs to be revisited 
and re-enacted in the light of widening of the functions of the Finance Commission in 
socio-economic environment(including the duty of the Finance Commission in relation 
to Panchayats and Municipalities). 
36.The Delivery of Books and News Papers (Public Libraries) Act, 1954 
(27 of 1954) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for delivery of books to the National 
Library and other public libraries. 
The Ministry of Culture vide their ID No.21-115/2014-C&N, dated the 29th 
September, 2014 [Refer Volume III, Part-I] stated that the existing Act has not been found 
effective. It provides very small amount of penalty on non-compliance which hardly 
worked as a deterrent. The implementation of the Act has not led to its intended purpose of 
creating National Repositories of Books and Newspapers published in the country. Hence 
the entire Act is being considered to be replaced. It further conveyed that after a meeting 
with the publishers, Ministry has decided to replace the existing Act by enacting a new Act. 
The Committee feels that the Administrative Ministry may revisit this Act and 
re-enact with necessary modifications in the light of changing means of communication 
and publication and circulation of e-books through internet, the provisions of this Act 
need to be revisited and re-enacted. 
37.The Terminal Tax on Railway Passengers Act, 1956 (69 of 1956) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted to provide for the levy of a terminal tax on 
passengers carried by railway from or to certain places of pilgrimage or where fairs, melas or 
exhibitions are held. 
The Ministry of Railways has not included the aforesaid Act in its reply [Refer 
Volume III, Part-III] 
In view of the rationalization of passengers' fares and running of special and 
premium trains with dynamic pricing of fairs, the Committee feels that the provisions 
of this Act are required to be revisited. 
38. The Assam Municipal (Manipur Amendment) Act, 1961 (49 of 1961): 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to amend the Assam Municipal Act, 1956 as in force 
in the Union Territory of Manipur. When the Act was enacted the Manipur was a Union 
territory and now it has become a State. 
The P.C. Jain Commission at Serial No. 3 of Appendix-A-5 (114 Central Acts for 
repeal by the State Government) in its report recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. 
The Ministry of Home Affairs vide its OM No.1-34020/122/2014-Coord.I dated the 
19th Sep, 2014 stated that it is not in favour to repeal the Act. Detailed examination for 
repeal/review of the act is needed in consultation with State Governments

consultation with the State concerned for repeal.

October, 2014 [Refer Volume III, Part-I] that the Department introduced a Bill in the Rajya 
587 
Sabha for amendment of section 26 (Cognizance of Offences) of the Atomic Energy Act, 
1962. While the 1992 Bill was pending consideration in Parliament, the Department felt the 
need for some more amendments to different sections of the Act. 	
Therefore, it was 
proposed to with draw the Bill and introduce a new Bill which would be a comprehensive 
one and later on in 2007, the same was withdrawn from the Cabinet. The Department is in 
the process of bringing limited amendments to section 2, 3, 14 and 22 of the Act. 
The aforesaid Act was enacted about 52 years ago and thereafter the use of Atomic 
energy in the field of Science and Medical Science and Energy etc., have increased manifold 
and advancement of technology have taken place. The Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage 
Act, 2010 has been enacted. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act may be re-visited 
and re-enacted as discussed above.

Act, 1965 (45) of 1965) 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted further to amend the Coal Mines Provident Fund 
and Bonus Schemes Act, 1948 and except sections 1 and 15, all other sections were repealed 
by Act 56 of 1974. Section 15 was for transfer of service of employees of the existing Board

article 82 of the Constitution, seats were allocated on the basis of 1971. The Committee feels 
that the provision contained in section 3 has become redundant. 
The Committee recommends that the Act may be repealed by the Legislative 
Department in consultation with the Election Commission.

provisions contained in sections 6 to 8 which are substantive in nature enabled the Central 
Government and the State Government to control pre-judicial publications.. 
The Committee feels that in view of the change of the means of communications, 
penal provisions in the Indian Penal Code for such publication, etc, the Act needs to be 
revisited and either repealed or re-enacted.

12th September, 2014 [Refer Volume III, Part-I] have stated in their D.O. that the Drugs and 
Cosmetics (Amendment) Bill 2007 was withdrawn due to major changes recommended by 
the Parliamentary Standing Committee, it was suggested for a fresh amendment Bill 
exclusively for allopathic drugs and to delink the provisions for AYUSH drugs from the 
Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. Accordingly, they have decided that the Department of 
AYUSH would bring a separate Bill at an appropriate time to enact a new Law for AYUSH 
Drugs and also move a separate Cabinet Note for introducing the Bill to amend the Drugs 
and Cosmetics Act 1940. Thereafter, Ayurvedic, Siddha and Unani Drugs Technical 
Advisory Board in its meeting held in September 2013 recommended to set up a Committee 
for formulating the draft Bill for AYUSH drugs 
The Department of AYUSH in their D.O. letter has confirmed that the Drugs and

while enacting the new legislation for AYUSH drugs.

merged to avoid multiplicity of the Central Acts and re-enacted.

Act, 1974 (54 of 1974) 
589 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to extend the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act, 
1949, to the Union territory of Chandigarh. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No.77 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed inter alia stated that the aforesaid Act is coercive and makes renting of property a 
low return business, disincentivising prospective landlords from entering the rental market. 
Consequently, there is an artificial scarcity of rental housing. The complicated machinery 
under the Act and difficulty faced in getting property vacated, abet illegality and litigation, 
and create a flourishing black market. The Task Force on Rental Housing under the Ministry 
of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation in its Report on Policy and Interventions to Spur 
Growth of Rental Housing in India submitted in March 2013, recommended simple contract-
based lease/rent agreements between willing renters and willing tenantsa, without the State 
imposing draconian price controls that, in effect, drive away legitimate renters and forces 
tenants to enter into unrecorded and informal arrangements that are detrimental to their 
interests. Market-oriented rent control models in other Asian countries have shown a positive 
impact on the rental market. In 2004, Hong Kong enacted the Landlord and Tenant 
(Consolidation Amendment) Act, removing security provisionsb for tenants to resume free 
operation of the private rental market. The Legislative Council Panel on Housing, 
Government of Hong Kong, studied the impact of the Ordinance in 2006. The law resulted in 
a steady rise in rental levels, increased supply of private residential units, and reduced 
tenancy disputes. Other countries like Japan and Singapore have also eased rent control 
policies. It further stated that there are no legal issues that would impede repeal: 
The Committee feels that the administrative Ministry may repeal the aforesaid 
Act protecting the interest of the existing tenants, so as to make them liable at once for 
manifold increase of the rent.

connected therewith. The aforesaid Act came into force on the 27th July, 1977 vide 
notification No. S.0.589 (E) dated the 27th July, 1977. There is no provision in the 
aforesaid Act which is yet to be brought into force. 
The aforesaid Act consists of ten sections, out of which- 
(a) sections 3 and 4 of the aforesaid Act relate to amendment of Scheduled Castes Order and 
amendment of Scheduled Tribes Order. Since, the aforesaid sections 3 and 4 had already been 
repealed by the Repealing and Amending Act, 1988 (19 of 1988) without making any specific 
savings and therefore these are not being discussed here. In view of repeal of aforesaid sections 3 
and 4, nothing survives under these sections. It is relevant to mention here that articles 341 and 342 
of the Constitution contains inter alia provisions for specifying for the purposes of this Constitution

the 16th September, 2014 has conveyed that the Rights of Person with Disabilities Bill, 2014 
has been introduced in the Rajya Sabha to replace the Persons with Disabilities (Equal 
Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 and has been referred 
to the Parliamentary Standing Committee. 
In view of the above, the Committee has no views in the matter except that the 
recommendations of the Hon'ble Standing Committee may be processed. 
55 . The Semiconductor Integrated Circuits Layout Design Act, 2000 
(37 of 2000) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to provide for the protection of semiconductor 
integrated circuits layout-designs and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. 
The aforesaid Act has been enacted inter alia for giving effect to section 6 in Part II 
of the Agreement in the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights relating to Lay 
out- Design (Topographies of Integrated Circuits). 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No.80 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed inter alia stated that the aforesaid Act made a distinction between intellectual 
property protection for the layout-design of ICs, and protection for all other inventions 
related to semiconductors. The former is protected by the present Act while the latter falls 
under the Patents Act, 1970 (39 of 1970). Intellectual property experts have pointed out that 
only a small part of the possible protection for ICs is covered under the present Act. This 
leads to confusion regarding the suitable authority for registering intellectual property 
protection. The Act sets up parallel agencies for the sole purpose of registering IC designs, 
when this work can easily be carried out by the existing bodies for intellectual property 
protection, for example, through the Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks 
set up under the Trade Marks Act, 1999. Further, the parallel bodies set up are not actually in 
593 
use. No design has been registered in the 14 years of the operation of the Registrar, and no 
cases have been filed under the Act. It further stated that in order to be TRIPS compliant, the 
protection under this Act can instead be granted under the Patents Act, 1970, which is 
already being used to protect all other aspects of semiconductors. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act is required to be re-visited in 
today's context and the provisions aforesaid Act can be merged in the Patents Act, 1970 
which is dealing with all other aspects of the semi-conductors, so as to reduce the 
multiplicity of the Acts on the Statute Book.

CHAPTER-11 
CENTRAL ACTS SUGGESTED FOR REPEAL BUT 
CONSIDERED FOR RETENTION OR REVISITING THEREOF 
1.The Land Improvement Loans Act, 1883 (19 of 1883) 
The aforesaid Act was passed by the Governor General of India in Council and 
received the assent of the Governor General on the 12th October, 1883. The aforesaid Act 
was enacted to consolidate and amend the law relating to loans of money by the Government 
for agricultural improvements. 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report has recommended for repeal of the 
aforesaid Act in consultation with the relevant States (s) at Sl. No. 42 under Chapter 2 of its 
Report. The Law Commission observed that the aforesaid Act consolidated and amended the 
law relating to loans of money by the Government for agricultural improvements. 
`Improvement', for the purposes of this Act, meant construction of wells, preparation of land 
for irrigation, etc. The Act lays down the procedure for application for loans and also, for the 
recovery of loans. Land Improvement and agricultural loans is now a State subject (Entry 18, 
List II). Every State now has a Land Mortgage Bank Act which authorises the setting up of a 
land mortgage bank. One of the purposes of this Bank is to help carry out agricultural 
improvements. Hence this Act has lost its relevance and must be repealed. The Central 
Government should write to the relevant State Governments recommending the review of 
this law by the State, with a view to repeal. The Central Government should also remove this 
law from its lists of central Acts in force. 
There are other Acts also such as the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural 
Development Act, 1981 (61 of 1981) and Public Sector Banks under the Central Acts, which 
inter alia provides for providing and regulating credit and other facilities for the promotion 
and development of agriculture, small-scale industries, cottage and village industries, 
handicrafts and other rural crafts and other allied economic activities in rural areas with a 
view to promoting integrated rural development and securing prosperity of rural areas and 
for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. 
Section 3 of the Land Improvement Loans Act, 1883, enables the local Government to grant 
loans for the purpose of making any improvement (any work which adds to letting value of 
land and includes construction of wells, tanks and other works for storage, supply or 
distribution of water for the purpose of agriculture or for the use of men and cattle used in 
agriculture. 
The Committee feels that in case the aforesaid Act is agriculture friendly and for 
the improvement of agriculture, it may be retained. In view of the paragraph 3 to 9 of 
Chapter 5, the Committee feels that the views of stake holders including the State 
Governments are required before taking a view on the aforesaid Act. 
595 
2. The Punjab District Boards Act, (XX of 1883) 
The aforesaid Act was passed by the Governor General of India in Council and 
received the assent of the Governor General on the 12th October, 1883. The aforesaid Act 
was enacted to make better provision for local self government in the Districts of the Panjab. 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at Sl. No. 43 under Chapter of the 
Report had recommended the Central Government should write to the State of Punjab 
seeking clarification on whether this Act is still in use. Law Commission observed that the 
Act made better provisions for the local self-government in the districts of Punjab. The Act 
envisaged District Boards for proper maintenance of the districts (construction of roads, 
management of property, registration of births and deaths, etc.). The Act also imposed a 
'local rate' payable on all land in the district by the landholders. The revenue from this 
collection would go towards the maintenance of the district. Evidence of the fact that this 
might still be relevant is that the Punjab Land Revenue Act, 1967 defines 'rates and cesses' 
to include the local rate payable under the Punjab District Board Act, 1883. However, the 
Act seems to have otherwise fallen into disuse. The Central Government should write to the 
Government of Punjab seeking clarification on whether this Act is still in use. The Central 
Government should also remove this law from its lists of central Acts in force. 
The Law Commission has not recommended for the repeal of the aforesaid Act. In 
view of the paragraph 3 to 9 of Chapter 5, the Committee feels that the views of stake 
holders including the State Governments are required before taking a view on the 
aforesaid Act. 
3.The Easements (Extending) Act, 1891(8 of 1891) 
The aforesaid Act was passed by the Governor General of India in Council and received 
the assent of the Governor General on the 6th March, 1891. The aforesaid Act was enacted 
to extend the Indian Easements Act, 1882 to certain areas in which that Act is not in force. 
The aforesaid Act contains only one section by which the Indian Easements Act, 1882 
(V of 1882) has been extended to Bombay and to North-west Provinces and Oudh. 
The P.C. Jain Commission in its Report at SI. 84 of Appendix A-1 (166 Central Acts 
recommended for repeal) had recommended for the repeal of this Act. 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at Sl. No. 49 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission observed that the 
aforesaid Act extended the Easements Act, 1882 to the territories administered by the 
Governor of Bombay in Council and the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western 
Provinces and Chief Commissioner of Oudh. This Act is now redundant as the territorial 
divisions that it describes do not exist now. The purpose of this Act has been fulfilled and 
hence, the Central Government should repeal this Act. 
Since, the Easements (Extending) Act, 1891 has been enacted only for the purpose 
of extending the principal legislation i.e., the Indian Easements Act, 1882, a view on the 
repeal of the aforesaid Act may be taken after consulting the stake holders. 
596 
4.The Arya Marriage Validation Act, 1937 (XIX of 1937) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to recognise and remove doubts as to the validity of 
inter-marriages current among Arya Samajists. 
The P.C.Jain Commission in its Report at Sl.No. 1 of Appendix-D has included the 
aforesaid Act. The Commission observed that there are number of personal laws applicable 
to some religions and communities. Some of these may not be relevant now and are also 
indeed very old. The perception of the concerned religion or community would be relevant 
for their updating/codification/repeal. The Commission recommends that further action be 
taken accordingly. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No.25 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed inter alia stated that the validity of marriages between Arya Samajis is recognised 
through the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Arya Samajis are specifically described under 
section 2(1)(a) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 as 'forms' or 'developments' of the Hindu 
religion and therefore their marriages fall within the scope of the Hindu Marriage Act. The 
present Act is merely repetitive and not required. 
The Legislative Department vide their D.O. No. 11(29)/2014-Leg.I dated the 12th 
September, 2014 at Sl. No. 49 of the Annexure annexed to the said D.O. letter have 
recommended for the repeal of the aforesaid Act. 
Attention is invited to section 2 of the aforesaid Act which reads as under: 
"2. Marriage between Arya Samajists not to be invalid.- Notwithstanding any provision of Hindu Law, 
usage or custom to the contrary no marriage contracted whether before or after the commencement of this Act 
between two persons being at the time of the marriage Arya Samajists shall be invalid or shall be deemed ever 
to have been invalid by reason only of the fact that the parties at any time belonged to different castes or 
different sub-castes of Hindus or that either or both of the parties at any time before the marriage belonged to a 
religion other than Hinduism.". 
The Committee has deliberated on the repeal of this Act and feels that in view of 
section 2 of the aforesaid Act which provides for validation of marriages not only before the 
enactment of aforesaid Act but also after the commencement of the aforesaid Act. The 
Administrative Ministry may re-visit their proposal to repeal the aforesaid Act and take a 
view in the matter as to whether the repeal of this Act shall affect the validation of marriages 
of two persons being at the time of the marriage are Arya Samajists. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act may be retained till views of the stake 
holders are obtained. 
5. The Khaddar (Protection of Name) Act, 1950 (78 of 1950) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to regulate the use of the words "Khaddar" and 
"Khadi" when applied as a trade description of woven materials. The aforesaid Act came 
into from the 28th December, 1950. 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at 51. No. 24 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act. The Law Commission, inter alio, 
observed that the aforesaid Act regulated the use of the words `Ichaddar' and `khadP when 
applied as a trade description of woven materials. The Act mandated that the words 
`khaddar' and `khadP, whether in Hindi, English, or in any other language, when applied to 
597 
any woven material, shall be deemed to be a trade description within the meaning of the 
Indian Merchandise Act, 1889. This was done to indicate that such material is cloth woven 
on handlooms in India from cotton, silk or woollen yarn or from a mixture of any two or all 
of such yarns. The Indian Merchandise Act, 1889 has been repealed but a corresponding 
amendment has not been made in this Act. In fact, `Ichadi was registered as a mark 
registered under the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and the Khadi Mark Regulations, 2013 were 
issued for the purpose of authentication of genuine khadi. Hence, this Act is now redundant 
and can be repealed. 
The aforesaid Act contains three sections. Section 2 of the aforesaid Act, inter alia, 
provides that the words `khaddar' and `khadi', whether in Hindi, English, or in any other 
language, when applied to any woven material, shall be deemed to be a trade description 
within the meaning of the Indian Merchandise Act, 1889, which has been repealed by the 
Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 with the saving clause. The Trade and Merchandise 
Marks Act, 1958 has been repealed by the Trade Marks Act, 1999 (47 of 1999) with a saving 
clause. 
Attention is invited to section 8 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, which reads as 
under:— 
'8. Construction of references to repealed enactments.- (1) Where this Act, or any Central Act or Regulation made after the 
commencement of this Act, repeals and re-enacts, with or without modification, any provision of a former enactment, then 
references in any other enactment or in any instrument to the provision so repealed shall, unless a different intention appears, 
be construed as references to the provision so re-enacted. 
(2) Where before the fifteenth day of August, 1947, any Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom repealed and re-enacted, 
with or without modification, any provision of a former enactment, then references in any Central Act or in any Regulation ' 
or instrument to the provision so repealed shall, unless a different intention appears, be construed as references to the provision 
so re-enacted.". 
In view of above, the Trade Description of "Khaddar" and "Khadi" would continue to 
exist. In case the Khaddar (Protection of Name) Act, 1950 is repealed, the protection 
of Trade Desription under the aforesaid Act may cease to exist to the detriment of the 
Khadi Industries. In case the concerned Ministry intends to repeal the aforesaid Act, 
the Committee suggests that the opinion of the Ld. Law Officer may be obtained and 
amendments, if necessary may be carried out in the aforesaid Act to continue the Trade 
Description of "Khaddar" and "Khadi" instead of repealing the aforesaid Act 
6. The Scheduled Areas (Assimilation of Laws) Act, 1951(37 of 1951) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to assimilate certain laws in force in the scheduled 
areas to the laws in force in the Districts of Darrang and Lakhimpur of the State of Assam. 
The P.C. Jain Commission recommended for its repeal Sl. No. 105 of Appendix A-1 
of its report (166 Central Acts for repeal by Central Government). 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at Sl. No. 69 under Chapter 2 of 
the Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission observed that the 
aforesaid Act assimilated certain laws in force in the scheduled areas (this refers to areas, 
which find mention in the Schedule appended to the Act, and not to Scheduled Areas under 
the Constitution) to the laws in force in the districts of Darrang and Lakhimpur of the State 
of Assam. The Act provided that all laws in force in the scheduled areas were to cease to be 
in force after the appointed day (as specified in the Act). After the appointed day, the laws in 
force in Darrang were to come into force in the areas mentioned in paragraph 1 of the 
598 
I
•I 
Schedule and the laws in force in Lakhimpur would come into force in the areas specified in 
paragraphs 2 and 3. The purpose of this Act has now been fulfilled. Hence, the Central 
Government should repeal this Act. 
The Ministry of Home Affairs vide their O.M.No. I 34020/122/2014-Coord.-I dated 
the 19th September, 2014 (Refer Vol. III, Part I) has stated that the State of Assam files 
original suit No. 1/89 in the Supreme Court of India and the matter is presently sub-judice. 
The Act may not be repealed. 
The Planning Commission has also at serial No. 6 of its I.D.No.25/04/2014 OM & C 
dated 11th September,2014(Refer Vol. III, Part I) has also recommended for its repeal. 
In view of above , the Committee feel that at present the aforesaid need not be 
repealed. 
7. The Companies (Donation to National Fund) Act, 1951(54 of 1951) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to enable companies to make donations to national 
The Law Commission of India in its 159th  Report and in 248th  Report at Sl. No. 58 
under Chapter 4 has also recommended for repeal of this Act. This Act enable companies to 
make donations to certain national funds, or any other Central Government approved 
charitable Funds. The Law Commission in its 159th Report recommended that this Act be 
repealed after incorporating relevant changes under the Companies Act, 1956. Section 135 
(Corporate Social Responsibility) read with Schedule VII imposes a mandatory duty on 
companies to contribute a specified percentage of their profits for a social and charitable 
purpose under the new Companies Act, 2013. Hence, the purpose of this Act has been 
subsumed by 2013 Act. In July, 2014, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs confirmed that the 
relevant provisions of this Act have already been incorporated in the new Companies Act, 
2013 and therefore the Companies (Donation to National Fund) Act, 1951, is redundant. 
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has forwarded an U.0 Number 8/3/2014-CLI 
dated 15th September, 2014 (Refer Vol. III, Part I) to the Secretariat of the Committee, 
which also contains a proposal to repeal the aforesaid Act in view of sections 181 and 183 of 
the Companies Act, 2013. The aforesaid sections 181 and 183 of the Companies Act, 2013 
read as under:— 
[Section 181. The Board of Directors of a company may contribute to bona fide charitable and other funds: 
Provided that prior permission of the company in general meeting shall be required for such contribution in 
case any amount the aggregate of which, in any financial year, exceed five per cent. of its average net 
profits for the three immediately preceding financial years. 
Section 183. (1) The Board of Directors of any company or any person or authority exercising the powers of 
the Board of Directors of a company, or of the company in general meeting, may, notwithstanding anything 
contained in sections 180, 181 and section 182 or any other provision of this Act or in the memorandum, 
articles or any other instrument relating to the company, contribute such amount as it thinks fit to the 
National Defence Fund or any other Fund approved by the Central Government for the purpose of national 
defence. 
(2) Every company shall disclose in its profits and loss account the total amount or amounts contributed by 
it to the Fund referred to in sub-section (/) during the financial year to which the amount relates.] 
Attention is invited to the Statement of Objects and Reasons for the enactment of the 
funds 
599 
Companies (Donation to National Fund) Act, 1951 and section 3 thereof which read as 
under:— 
[Statement of Objects and Reasons: 
The Associated Chambers of Commerce and many companies who are desirous of making donations to the 
Sardar Vallabhbhai National Memorial Fund which has been established for carrying our objects conducive 
to the general welfare have approached Government to remove the legal difficulty that has arisen owing to 
the absence of a provision in the Articles of the Association of some companies authorising the making of 
such donations. Even if the shareholders decide at a special meeting to make a donation, in the absence of 
any authorising provision in the Articles of Association, they are not legally entitled to do so. Act 35 of 
1948 was passed for the purpose of removing this difficulty in the case of donations to the Gandhi National 
Memorial Fund. It is now proposed that a similar legislation be undertaken to cover donations to the Sardar 
Vallabhbhai National Memorial Fund and other similar National Funds established for charitable purposes 
and which by reason of their national importance have been approved by the Central Government in this 
behalf. The donations can only be made if the general body of the companies have met at a special meeting 
and approved the making of such gifts by the passing of an extraordinary resolution in the manner required 
by S. 81 of the Indian Companies Act, 1913 . As a matter of drafting the Bill has been framed as a 
consolidating measure." --Gazette of India, 22-9-1951, Pt. 11, S. 2, p.656.] 
Section 3 of the Companies (Donation to National Fund) Act, 1951 is as under:— 
[Section 3. Power of companies to make donations to certain National Funds. Any company may, 
notwithstanding anything contained in the Companies Act or in any other law for the time being in force 
regulating the affairs thereof, and notwithstanding that the memorandum or articles of association of the 
company do not enable it so to do, by an extraordinary resolution passed in accordance with the provisions 
contained in section 81 of the Companies Act, authorise the making of donations to the Gandhi National 
Memorial Fund or the Sardar Vallabhbhai National Memorial Fund, or to any other Fund established for a 
charitable purpose which by reason of its national importance has been approved by the Central 
Government for the purposes of this section]. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No.87 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed inter alia stated that the Department of Company Affairs has proposed repeal of the 
Act by incorporating the relevant provisions under the Companies Act, 1956. The Law 
Commission in its 159th Report (1998) has noted this fact in Chapter 3 at Page 23. The Act 
is legally untenable, in so far as it empowers the Company to make donations irrespective of 
its Memorandum or Articles of Association, in view of section 36 of the Companies Act, 
which makes the aforesaid documents binding not only on the Company but also its 
members. Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013, read with, Schedule VII of the Act and 
the Companies (Corporate Social Responsibility) Rules, 2014, mandatorily requires 
companies to contribute a fixed percentage of profits, for a social and charitable purpose. 
The 2013 Act has application and scope wide enough to achieve the purpose that the 
Companies (Donation to National Funds) Act, sought to achieve. It further stated that there 
are no legal issues that would impede repeal. 
Now, a new law, namely, the Companies Act, 2013 (18 of 2013) has been enacted 
and as per the provisions contained in section 135 of the said Act read with Schedule VII, 
every company has to ensure that it spends, in every financial year, at least two per cent. of 
the average net profits of the company made during the three immediately preceding 
financial years, in pursuance of its Corporate Social Responsibility Policy. After the 
enactment of the new law the provisions of this Act has become redundant. 
The Committee noted that the expression — 
"the making of donations to the Gandhi National Memorial Fund or the Sardar 
600 
Vallabhbhai National Memorial Fund, or to any other Fund established for a charitable 
purpose which by reason of its national importance has been approved by the Central 
Government for the purposes of this section" used in section 3 of the Companies (Donation 
to National Fund) Act, 1951. 
It would be relevant to draw attention to the following intent of the legislatures 
reflected in the Statement of Objects and Reasons for the aforesaid Act which is as under:-
"Act 35 of 1948 was passed for the purpose of removing this difficulty in the case of 
donations to the Gandhi National Memorial Fund. It is now proposed that a similar 
legislation be undertaken to cover donations to the Sardar Vallabhbhai National Memorial 
Fund and other similar National Funds established for charitable purposes and which by 
reason of their national importance have been approved by the Central Government in this 
behalf" 
Sections 181 and 183 of the Companies Act, 2013 allows the Companies to make 
donations for bona fide charitable and other purposes and to the National Defence Fund or 
any other Fund approved by the Central Government for the purpose of national defence. 
The donations to the Sardar Vallabhbhai National Memorial Fund and other similar National 
Funds established for charitable purposes and which by reason of their national importance 
have been approved by the Central Government in this behalf are different and cannot be 
equated with the donations for bonafide, charitable and other purposes. The Committee feels 
that the donations made to the Sardar Vallabhbhai National Memorial Fund and other similar 
National Funds established for charitable purposes and which by reason of their national 
importance cannot be similar to the donations made to the aforesaid funds of national 
importance. 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act may be retained and the procedure 
for making a donation by the Companies to the aforesaid National Funds be made 
simpler under the aforesaid Act. 
8. The Scheduled Areas (Assimilation of Laws) Act, 1953(16 of 1953) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to assimilate certain laws in force in the scheduled 
areas to the laws in force in the Districts of Darrang and Lakhimpur of the State of Assam. 
The P.C. Jain Commission recommended for its repeal SI. No. 106 of Appendix A-1 
of its report (166 Central Acts for repeal by Central Government). 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at SI. No. 71 under Chapter 2 of 
the Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the earlier 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission observed the 
aforesaid Act assimilated certain laws in force in the scheduled areas (the areas mentioned in 
the Schedule to the Act) to the laws in force in the districts of Nowgong and Sibsagar in the 
State of Assam. The Act provided that all laws in force in the scheduled areas were to cease 
to be in force after the appointed day (as specified in the Act). After the appointed day, the 
laws in force in Nowgong would come into force in the areas mentioned in paragraph 1 of 
the Schedule and the laws in force in Sibsagar would come into force in the areas specified 
in paragraph 2. The purpose of this Act has now been fulfilled. Hence, the Central 
Government should repeal this Act 
601 
The Ministry of Home Affairs vide their O.M.No. I 34020/122/2014-Coord.-I dated 
the 19th September, 2014 (Refer Vol III, Part 1) has stated that the State of Assam files 
original suit No. 2/88 in the Supreme Court of India and the matter is presently sub-judice 
and the Act may not be repealed. 
The Planning Commission has also at serial No. 7 of its I.D.No.25/04/2014 OM & C 
(Refer Vol III, Part 1) dated 11th September,2014 has also recommended for its repeal. 
In view of above , the Committee feel that at present the aforesaid need not be repealed. 
9. The Lushai Hills District (Change of Name) Act, 1954 (18 of 1954) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to change the name of the Lushai Hills District. 
The Law Commission in its 249th Report at SI.No 72 under Chapter 2 hascategorised 
the aforesaid Act under the Category, namely the State Re-organisation and Extension of 
Laws and recommended Repeal of the aforesaid Act without mentioning consultation with 
the stake holders. The Law Commission observed that the aforesaid Act changed the name 
of the Lushai Hills District (a tribal area in Assam). After the commencement of this Act, the 
Lushai Hills District came to be known as the Mizo District. The Act also made amendments 
to the Sixth Schedule so as to insert `Mizo District' wherever lushai Hills District' found a 
mention. The Act has now served its purpose. Hence, the Central Government should repeal 
this Act with a suitable savings clause. This Act has also been recommended for review by 
the PC Jain Commission Report (Appendix B). 
The Committee feel that the aforesaid Act may be retained and considered for 
repeal after specific confirmation from the stake holders. 
10. The Shillong Rifle Range and Umlong Cantonments Assimilation of 
Laws Act, 1954 (31 of 1954) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to assimilate certain laws in force in the scheduled 
areas to the laws in force in the Khasi and Jaintia Hills districts. 
The P.C. Jain Commission at Serial No. 107 of Appendix-A-1 (166 Central Acts for 
repeal by the Central Government) in its report recommended for repeal of the aforesaid 
Act. 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at SI. No. 74 under Chapter 2 of 
the Report also recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act without mentioning 
consultation with relevant State(s). The Law Commission categorised the aforesaid under the 
Category, namely, State Re-organisation and Extension of Laws The Law Commission 
observed that the aforesaid Act assimilated certain laws in force in the scheduled areas to the 
laws in force in the Khasi and Jaintia Hills district. The Act provided that all laws in force in 
the scheduled areas were to cease to be in force after the appointed day. After the appointed 
day, the laws in force in the Khasi and Jaintia Hills district were to come into force in the 
areas mentioned in the Schedule. The purpose of this Act has now been fulfilled. Hence, the 
Central Government should repeal this Act. 
602 
The Ministry of Home Affairs vide its OM No1-34020/122/2014-Coord.1 dated 19th 
Sep, 2014(Refer Vol. III, Part I) stated that Khasi Autonomous District Council is claiming 
that Shillong Cantonment and municipality of Shillong Area was part and parcel of the Sixth 
Schedule areas and hence these area be transferred to them and thus the Act may not be 
repealed at this stage 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act may not be 
repealed at present. 
11. The Prize Competitions Act, 1955 (42 of 1955) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted in pursuance of the legislative competence conferred 
upon the Parliament by the Legislatures of the States of Andhra, Bombay, Madras, Orissa, 
Uttar Pradesh, Hyderabad, Madhya Bharat, Patiala and East Punjab States Union and 
Saurashtra have passed resolutions in terms of clause (1) of article 252 of the Constitution 
in relation to the above-mentioned matter and matters ancillary thereto in so far as such 
matter or matters enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No.73 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed inter alia stated that the Prize Competitions Act was passed by the Centre, on a 
resolution passed by the aforesaid States under article 252 of the Constitution. However, 
each of these states has its own legislation pertaining to regulation of gambling and betting, 
namely: 
• The Bombay Prevention of Gambling Act, 1887 (also applicable in Gujarat) 
• Madras City Police Act, 1888 
• Orissa Prevention of Gambling Act, 1955

Additionally, some of the States mentioned in section 1(2) of the Act no longer exist. It 
further stated that the Repeal will impact pending cases under the Act. Along with repeal, a 
saving clause can be enacted to save application of Act on pending cases. 
At this stage, it is not feasible to the Committee to take a view in the matter. 
The administrative Ministry may peruse the above observations for taking a view in 
the matter. 
12. The Sugar Export Promotion Act, 1958 (30 of 1958) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to provide for the export of sugar in the public interest 
and for the levy and collection in certain circumstances of an additional duty of excise on 
sugar produced in India. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No.74 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed inter alia stated that the aforesaid Act is not being implemented. Up until 1997, 
exports of sugar were carried out under the provisions of the Sugar Export Promotion Act 
(1958), through the notified export agencies, i.e., Indian Sugar and General Industry Export 
Import Corporation Ltd. and State Trading Corporation of India. In a move to deregulate the 
603 
sugar industry, the Act was repealed on 15 January 1997, through an ordinance by the 
United Front Government. However, the ordinance was never validated by legislation. Now, 
the export of sugar can be undertaken directly by various sugar mills after obtaining export a 
Release Order from the Directorate of Sugar. Hence, the Act continues to be in force, 
although it is not implemented. The Act is not in tune with the policy of liberalising the 
sugar sector. The gradual liberalisation and de-licensing of the sugar industry from 1998 
allowed investments to flow in, enabled increase in installed capacity and scale of 
operations, and made the sugar industry more competitive. The average annual growth rate 
of the installed capacity of the sugar industry increased from 3.3% between 1990-91 and 
1997-98 to 6.9% between 1998-99 and 2011-12. However, the export policy, based on 
domestic availability, demand and price, continued to be heavily regulated and complicated. 
In 2011-2012, sugar exports were placed under the Open General License System (OGL). In 
May 2012, the Government further 	
de-regulated sugar exports, by removing quantitative 
restrictions in order to expedite shipments. In October 2012, the Report of the Committee on 
the Regulation of Sugar Sector in India, under the chairmanship of the then Chairman of the 
Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, Dr. C. Rangarajan, also recommended 
removal of all quantitative restrictions on trade in sugar and abolition of export licensing. It 
further stated that there are no legal issues that would impede repeal. 
The aforesaid Act was repealed by the Sugar Export Promotion (Repeal) Ordinance, 
1997 (4 of 1997). No information is available with the Committee as to whether the 
aforesaid Ordinance was replaced by an Act. Similarly, in the past, the Out of Turn 
Allotment of Government Residences (Validation) Ordinance, 1997 (14 of 1997) was 
promulgated, but no information is available as to whether the said Ordinance was replaced 
by an Act. 
A view would have to be taken by the administrative Ministry in consultation 
with the Department of Legal Affairs, Ministry of Law and Justice as to whether the 
Sugar Export Promotion Act, 1958 would stand revived or would be considered as 
repealed by the said Ordinance in view of the Out of Turn Allotment of Government 
Residences (Validation) Ordinance, 1997 (14 of 1997) which was not replaced by the 
Act and other legislative precedence and Constitutional provisions. 
13. The Legislative Assembly of Nagaland (Change in Representation) Act, 
1968 (61 of 1968) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to provide for a change in representation in the 
Legislative Assembly of Nagaland and for that purpose to make consequential amendments 
in the State of Nagaland Act, 1962 and the Representation of the People Act, 1950. 
The Law Commission of India in its 249th Report at SI. No. 75 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act without mentioning consultation with relevant 
State(s) and mentioning the earlier recommendations of the RC Jain Commission. The Law 
Commission observed that the aforesaid Act provided for a change in representation in the 
Legislative Assembly of Nagaland, and made consequential amendments to the State of 
Nagaland Act, 1962 and the Representation of the People Act, 1950. The Act amended 
Section 11 of the State of Nagaland Act, 1962 and also, the proviso to Section 7(1) of the 
Representation of the People Act, 1950 along with the Second Schedule of the Act. Since the 
amendments have been duly made, the purpose of the Act has been fulfilled. Hence, the 
Central Government should repeal this Act with a suitable savings clause. This Act has also 
been recommended for review by the PC Jain Commission Report (Appendix B). 
The Committee feels that the aforesaid Act may not be repealed at present in 
the absence of views of the concerned Ministry and State Government. 
604 
14. The Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling 
Activities Act, 1974 (52 of 1974) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to provide for preventive detention in certain cases for 
the purposes of conservation and augmentation of Foreign Exchange and prevention of 
smuggling activities and for matters connected therewith. 
The Centre for Civil Society at SI. No.90 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed inter alia stated that the aforesaid Act is redundant in view of the Foreign 
Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA). FEMA is the primary law relating to foreign 
exchange, which aims at facilitating external trade and payments, and promoting orderly 
development and maintenance of the foreign exchange market in India. It classifies any 
foreign exchange violation as a civil offence. FEMA replaced the Foreign Exchange 
Regulation Act under which foreign exchange violation was a criminal offence. However, 
COFEPOSA continues to criminalise (by providing for preventive detention) the aforesaid 
yiolations. Provisions related to smuggling under COFEPOSA are adequately covered under 
Chapter XVI of the Customs Act, 1962 (Section 115). The Customs Act has provisions for 
the confiscation (under Section 111, 113 and 118) and seizure of the smuggled goods (under 
Section 110) while also providing penal provisions. Apart from the wide interpretation of the 
word smuggling to include a range of activities, it also has penal provisions for non-
accounting of goods (under Section 116). The aforesaid Act has increasingly become a 
source of harassment, manipulation and corruption. Stringent provisions of COFEPOSA are 
invoked to harass exporters against minor violations of foreign exchange regulations. 
Customs authorities resorted to COFEPSA to detain exporters without any trial in cases 
where they had unintentionally violated foreign exchange regulations. It further stated that in 
Dropti Devi and Anr. Vs. Union of India, the constitutional validity of the Act was upheld. 
The Court highlighted the importance of the Act and the need to protect foreign exchange. 
Aside from this, there are no legal issues that would impede repeal. 
Having regard to the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962 and the Foreign 
Exchange Management Act, 1999, the Committee feels that the Conservation of 
Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 have not become 
redundant. 	
At present, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act may not be 
repealed. The issue of repealing the aforesaid Act can be considered having regard to 
the total amount of foreign exchange confiscated in violation of the law, the number of 
cases for prosecution initiated and the percentage of acquittal in such cases. 
15. The Departmentalisation of Union Accounts (Transfer of Personnel) 
Act, 1976 (59 of 1976) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to provide for the transfer of Officers serving in the 
Indian Audit and Accounts Department to any Ministry, Department or Office of the Central 
Government for facilitating the efficient discharge by such Ministry, Department or Office of 
the responsibility in connection with compiling the accounts thereof 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No.92 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed inter alia stated that the aforesaid Act has served its purpose. The aforesaid Act led 
to the creation of Indian Civil Accounts Service(ICAS). The initial intake into the ICAS was 
by deputing and transferring personnel from the Indian Audit and Accounts Service (IAAS). 
This law facilitated the transfer of personnel from the IAAS to the ICAS. ICAS personnel 
605 
are now selected through the Civil Services Examination; hence there is no need for transfer 
of personnel from the IAAD to the WAS as it has its own recruitment service. It further 
stated that there are no legal issues that would impede repeal. 
Attention is invited to clause (5) of article 148 of the Constitution, which reads as under:— 
[148. Comptroller and Auditor-General of India. 
[(5) Subject to the provisions of this Constitution and of any law made by Parliament, the conditions of 
service of persons serving in the Indian Audit and Accounts Department and the administrative 
powers of the Comptroller and Auditor-General shall be such as may be prescribed by rules made by 
the President after consultation with the Comptroller and Auditor-General.] 
There are separate rules for the conditions of the service of the persons serving in the 
Indian Audit and Accounts Department. The administrative powers of the Comptroller and 
Auditor-General are prescribed by the rules made by the President after consultation with the 
Comptroller and Auditor-General. 
The Comptroller and Auditor-General is the appropriate Authority to take a view in 
the matter and recommend for the repeal of the aforesaid Act as the aforesaid Act relates to 
the administrative matter falling within the jurisdiction of the Comptroller and Auditor-
General. 
In view of the above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid may not be repealed 
until the same is recommended for repeal by the Comptroller and Auditor-General. 
16. The Punjab Disturbed Areas Act, 1983 (32 of 1983) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to make better provision for the suppression of 
disorder and for the restoration and maintenance of public order in disturbed areas in Punjab. 
The P.C.Jain Commission in its Report at Si. No. 108 (114 Central Acts 
recommended for repeal by the State Governments) had recommended for repeal of the 
aforesaid Act. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Si. No.95 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed inter alia stated that the aforesaid Act was brought into force to curb militancy and 
public unrest in Punjab during the 1980s. It empowers the State Government to declare, by 
notification, any part or the whole of Punjab as a 'disturbed area', empowering any 
Magistrate or police officer not below the rank of a Sub-Inspector (or Havildar in the case of 
the Armed Branch of the police) to fire upon or use force (even if it leads to death), or 
prohibit the assembly of five or more persons or carrying of weapons, firearms, ammunition 
and explosive substances, where he considers necessary and after giving due warning. 
Therefore, the aforesaid Act is now redundant since militancy in the State has been wiped 
out and no major terrorist activity has taken place in the past two decades. In the absence of 
the threat of terrorist activity specifically within Punjab, the Act gives excessive power to the 
police force. The aforesaid Act is not being implemented in practice. Under the aforesaid 
Act, the whole of Punjab was declared as a disturbed arca, by a notification dated the 16 
November 1996, for a period of six months only, between 18 November 1996 and 17 May 
1997. Prior to this, another notification, dated the 09 March 1989, declared Amritsar, 
Gurdaspur and Ferozepur as disturbed areas. The aforesaid 1989 notification was withdrawn 
on the 28 July 2008. Since then, no part of Punjab has been declared as a disturbed area. The 
law was enacted during President's Rule in Punjab. There is an elected Government in place 
with powers under the Constitution to maintain law and order in the State. 
The Law Commission of India in its 250th  Report at Sl. No. 64 under Chapter 2 of the 
Report had recommended for repeal of the aforesaid Act referring to the earlier 
606 
recommendations of the P.C. Jain Commission. The Law Commission, inter alia, observed 
that the aforesaid Act provided for the suppression of disorder and for the restoration and 
maintenance of public order in the disturbed areas of Punjab. The Act empowered the State 
Government to declare the whole or any part of any district of Punjab as a disturbed area. 
This Act was enacted as a direct response to the rise of militancy in Punjab during the 1980s 
and gives extensive powers to police officers to use force in order to maintain peace and 
order. By virtue of a notification dated 16th November 1996, the whole State of Punjab was 
declared a disturbed area for a period of six months, i.e., from 18th November 1996 to 17th 
May 1997. Also, by a notification dated 9th March 1989, Amritsar, Gurdaspur and 
Ferozepur were declared as disturbed areas. However, this notification was withdrawn on 
28th July 2008. Prima ( facie, there are no areas declared as disturbed in the State of Punjab 
and the need for this Act has been dispensed with. The Central Government should write to 
the Government of Punjab to ascertain the status of the Act and also, if any areas are still 
declared as disturbed areas within the State. 
The administrative Ministry has offered no comments in respect of the repeal of 
the aforesaid Act, which is of administrative in nature and related to the security of the 
State. The Committee has no views in respect of the repeal of the aforesaid Act, which 
may be considered in consultation with the concerned administrative Ministry and the 
concerned State Government. 
17. The Chandigarh Disturbed Areas Act, 1983 (33 of 1983) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to make better provision for the suppression of 
disorder and for the restoration and maintenance of public order in disturbed areas in 
Chandigarh. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Sl. No.96 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed inter alia stated that the aforesaid Act empowers the Administrator of the Union 
Territory of Chandigarh to declare, by notification, any part or the whole of Union Territory 
of Chandigarh as a 'disturbed area', empowering any Magistrate or police officer not below 
the rank of a Sub-Inspector (or Havildar in the case of the Armed Branch of the police) to 
fire upon or use force (even if it leads to death), or prohibit the assembly of five or more 
persons or carrying of weapons, firearms, ammunition and explosive substances, where he 
considers necessary and after giving due warning. The aforesaid Act also gives protection to 
persons acting in the exercise of powers under the Act. The aforesaid Act was brought into 
force to curb militancy and public unrest in Chandigarh during the 1980s and early 1990s, in 
wake of Operation Blue Star. Militancy in the Union Territory has been wiped out and no 
major terrorist activity has taken place since 1995. Under the aforesaid Act, Chandigarh was 
declared as 'disturbed area', through Notifications dated 2 December 1986 and 5 December 
1991. In 2012, the Punjab and IIaryana High Court quashed these notifications on the 
grounds that they were not justified because the government failed to reply as to when the 
powers under the Act were last invoked or place on record any specific instances of threat 
perception warranting continuance of notifications under the Act. The aforesaid Act gives 
excessive power and impunity to the police force. For these reasons, the aforesaid Act should 
be repealed. It further stated that there are no legal issues that would impede repeal. 
The administrative Ministry has offered no comments in respect of the repeal of 
the aforesaid Act, which is of administrative in nature and related to the security of the 
State. The Committee has no views in respect of the repeal of the aforesaid Act, which 
may be considered in consultation with the concerned administrative Ministry and the 
concerned Government of the Union territory of Chandigarh. 
607 
18. The Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals.) Act, 1983 
(39 of 1983) 
The aforesaid Act was enacted to provide for the establishment of Tribunals for the 
determination, in a fair manner, of the question whether a person is an illegal migrant to 
enable the Central Government to expel illegal migrants from India and for matters 
connected therewith or incidental thereto. 
The Centre for Civil Society at Si. No.94 of its compendium of 100 laws to be 
repealed inter alia stated that the aforesaid Act instituted procedures to determine whether 
persons suspected to be illegal immigrants from Bangladesh did, in fact, fall under that 
category, and expel them from India. It was applicable only to the state of Assam (detection 
of foreigners in other states is done under The Foreigners Act, 1946). The aforesaid Act 
established Tribunals for determining whether a person is an illegal migrant. The 
constitutionality of this Act was challenged in Sarbananda Sonowal vs. Union of India. The 
Supreme Court declared that this Act was far less effective than the Foreigners Act in 
identifying and deporting illegal immigrants. It violated the duty of the Union, under Article 
355 of the Constitution, to protect states from external aggression and internal disturbance. 
The Court struck down the aforesaid Act and Rules, ordered that the Tribunals under the 
aforesaid Act cease to function, and declared that the Foreigners Act and other related Acts 
would operate in Assam instead. The aforesaid Act, though inoperative, remains on the 
statute books, while a more effective system is in place in Assam as prescribed by the 
Foreigners Act, 1946. The aforesaid Act should therefore be formally repealed. It further 
stated that there are no legal issues that would impede repeal. 
The administrative Ministry has offered no comments in respect of the repeal of 
the aforesaid Act, which is of administrative in nature and related to the security of the 
State. The Committee has no views in respect of the repeal of the aforesaid Act, which 
may be considered in consultation with the concerned administrative Ministry and the 
concerned State Government.

CHAPTER-12 
THE ACTS OR PROVISIONS THEREOF WHICH HAS NOT COME INTO FORCE

1926). Sub-section (2) of section 1 provides that the aforesaid Act shall come into force on 
such date as the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette appoint. As 
per records made available with the Committee, no reference is available as to whether the 
provisions of the aforesaid Act have come into force or not. The aforesaid Act inter alia 
contains provisions for the recognition of the trade unions and unfair trade practices by trade 
unions. 
In view of Report of the first National Commission on Labour in 1969, and the Report 
second National Commission on Labour in 2002 and expiry of 67 years since enactment of 
the Indian Trade Unions (Amendment) Act, 1947, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act, 
notwithstanding whether the provisions of the same has come into force or not, have become 
obsolete and redundant in today's context and would require revisiting the same. The 
Ministry of Labour in its e-mail dated 12th September, 2014 sent to the office of the 
Committee is silent on the enforcement of the aforesaid Act. 
In view of above, the Committee feels that the aforesaid Act may be repealed in 
case it has not come into force.

Ministry may kindly examine as to whether section 2 of the aforesaid Act has come into 
force or not. If it has not come into force, the said may be brought into force or repealed. In 
the meanwhile the Committee has recommended that the aforesaid Act can be repealed partly 
in respect of aforesaid sections. However, in case all the provisions of the aforesaid have 
come into force, then in that case, the whole Act can be repealed. 
12.The Prevention of Money-laundering Amendment Act, 2005 (20 of 2005) 
Sub-section (2) of section 1 of the aforesaid Act provides that the provisions of the

Department in the Ministry of Law and Justice vide their OM No. 1(1)/2012-Corr. Dated 12th  
September, 2014 informed the Committee that the copies of the notification bringing into 
force the aforesaid Act are not available with them. The Administrative Ministry may

different dates 5th  July, 2006, with respect to section 4, vide Notification No. S.O. 990(E) 
dated 3"I  July, 2006 may be appointed for different provisions of this Act. 
The commencement clause of the aforesaid Act is not very clear. In case, all the 
provisions of the aforesaid Act, have come into force, then in that case, then the aforesaid 
Act can be repealed or the administrative Ministry may take appropriate steps for early 
inforcement of the provisions of the aforesaid Act and thereafter the aforesaid Act may 
be repealed. 
14. The Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Amending Act, 2006 
(25 of 2006) 
The aforesaid Act received the assent of President on the 2nd  June, 2006. The 
aforesaid Act does not contain any commencement clause and therefore it has come into 
force on the date of assent i.e. the 2nd  June, 2006. It contains only 2 sections. Section 2 
amends section 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2005. The aforesaid 
Act does not contain any substantive provision or saving or validation provision and 
therefore repeal of this Act has to be examined with the enforcement of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2005 in consultation with the administrative 
Department and Department of Legal Affairs. 
15. The Salary, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament 
(Amendment) Act, 2006 ( 40 of 2006). 
Sub-section (2) of section 1 of the aforesaid Act provides that it shall come into force 
on such date for sections 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 as the Central Government may, by notification in 
the Official Gazette, appoint; and different dates may be appointed for different provisions of 
this Act. The aforesaid Act contains total 9 sections out of which sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 
9 have been brought into force on 15th  September, 2006 vide notification No. G.S.R. 561(E) 
dated the 15th  September, 2006. Section 5 of the aforesaid Act is deemed to have added with 
effect from the 17th  day of May, 2004. Section 2 of the aforesaid Act does not mention date 
of bringing into force the said section. It can be construed that the aforesaid section 2 has 
come into force from date of assent of the President to the aforesaid Act. It is suggested that 
before repeal of aforesaid section 2, the administrative Ministry and Department of Legal 
Affairs may be consulted. In the meanwhile the Committee feels that sections 3 to 9 of the 
613 
aforesaid Act can be repealed. 
16.The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2006 (54 of 2006) 
The aforesaid Act has come into force with effect from 12th  February, 2007 vide 
Notification No. S.O. 184(E) dated the 12th  February, 2007. Section 6 of the aforesaid Act 
contains substantive provision i.e. saving of orders issued under section 3 of the Essential 
Commodities Act, 1955. The Committee was inclined to repeal the Essential Commodities 
(Amendment) Act, 2006 but it was not clear as to whether the Schedule mentioned in the 
Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2006 is part of that Act or of the principal Act i.e. 
the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. The Committee feels that the Essential 
Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2006 can be repealed by making a special provision for 
savings provided in the aforesaid section 6 after taking a view in the matter as to 
whether the Schedule 	
is a part of the Amending Act i.e. the Essential Commodities 
(Amendment) Act, 2006 or the principal Act i.e. the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 as 
there is a reference of the aforesaid Schedule as saving clause 6 of the Essential 
Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2006.

Administrative Ministry may confirm as to whether the aforesaid Act has been brought into

14 of the aforesaid Act, if required. In case, the aforesaid Act has not been brought into

2. The Tribunal/Appellate Tribunals/Boards are established under the Central Acts 
enacted in pursuance of the provisions as contained in articles 323A and 323B of the 
Constitution, as amended by the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976. The 
objects and reasons for setting up of tribunals for the aforesaid Constitution Amendment 
is under:- 
"To reduce the mounting arrears in High Courts and to secure the 
speedy disposal of service matters, revenue matters and certain other 
matters of special importance in the context of the socio-economic 
development and progress, it is considered expedient to provide for 
administrative and other tribunals for dealing with such matters while 
preserving the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in regard to such 
matters under article 136 of the Constitution. It is also necessary 
to make certain modifications in the writ jurisdiction of the High Courts under 
article 226. ". 
3. In terms of articles 323A and 323B of the Constitution, the aforesaid Tribunals were 
constituted with a view to speedy disposal of the cases and at the same time reducing the 
burden of various courts and also to reduce pendency. 
4. The Committee would like to draw attention to the Judgment of the Supreme Court 
given in L. Chadra Kumar vs. Union of India case, which inter alia observed as under:— 
"100. In view of the reasoning adopted by us, we hold that Clause 2(d) of Article 323A 
and Clause 3(d) of Article 32313, to the extent they exclude the jurisdiction of the High 
617 
Courts and the Supreme Court under Articles 226/227 and 32 of the Constitution, are 
unconstitutional. Section 28 of the Act and the "exclusion of jurisdiction" clauses in all 
other legislations enacted under the aegis of Articles 323A and 323B would, to the same 
extent, be unconstitutional. The jurisdiction conferred upon the High Courts under 
Articles 226/227 and upon the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution is part 
of the inviolable basic structure of our Constitution. While this jurisdiction cannot be 
ousted, other courts and Tribunals may perform a supplemental role in discharging the 
powers conferred by Articles 226/227 and 32 of the Constitution. The Tribunals created 
under Article 323A and Article 323B of the Constitution are possessed of the competence 
to test the constitutional validity of statutory provisions and rules. All decisions of these 
Tribunals will, however, be subject to scrutiny before a Division Bench of the High Court 
within whose jurisdiction the concerned Tribunal falls. The Tribunals will, nevertheless, 
continue to act like Courts of first instance in respect of the areas of law for which they 
have been constituted. It will not, therefore, be open for litigants to directly approach the 
High Courts even in cases where they question the vires of statutory legislations (except 
where the legislation which creates the particular Tribunal is challenged) by overlooking 
the jurisdiction of the concerned Tribunal. Section 5(6) of the Act is valid and 
constitutional and is to be interpreted in the manner we have indicated.". 
5. In view of the aforesaid judgement of the Supreme Court in L.Chandrakumar Vs 
Union of India an aggrieved party can move the Division Bench of the High Court 
against any judgement and order of this Tribunal by way of filing Writ Petition under 
article 226 of the Constitution. 
6. The Committee would like to draw attention towards judgement of the Supreme Court 
given in Madras Bar Association vs. Union of India and anr. dated the 25th September, 
2014 which may be read as under:- 
"41. Chandra Kumar and R. Gandhi have allowed tribunalization at the original 
stage subject to certain safeguards. The boundary has finally been crossed in this 
case. I would, therefore, hold that the National Tax Tribunals Act is 
unconstitutional, being the ultimate encroachment on the exclusive domain of the 
superior Courts of Record in India.". 
7. 
In view of the above, the Committee feels that the objects and reason for 
establishing the Tribunal/Appellate Tribunals/Boards needs to be re-visited and the 
other alternatives for constituting additional specialised benches of High Courts for 
the subjects or the matters adjudicated Tribunal/Appellate Tribunals/Boards may 
be explored.

CHAPTER-14 
ENACTMENT OF A SEPARATE CENTRAL ACT FOR COMMON 
PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL EXISTING CENTRAL ACTS AND 
OTHER LAWS TO BE ENACTED IN FUTURE. 
The Committee would like to draw attention to the fact that there are certain 
provisions repeated in the Central Acts as a verbatim or with slight modifications. Some of 
such provisions relate to laying of sub-ordinate legislations viz. rules and regulations before 
the Houses of Parliament, power to remove difficulty, etc. The repetitive inclusions of the 
same provisions make the legislation bulky, require more administrative efforts (printing, 
proof reading, etc. and spending of valuable time of legislatures when such clauses are put to 
vote). The Committee feels that keeping all provisions which are repetitive in nature can be 
included into a single umbrella legislation by either bringing amendments in the General 
Clauses Act, 1897 or a separate legislation which would be applicable to all existing 
legislations and also the legislations enacted in future. Further, wherever any variation from 
such common provisions is required and is necessary for under any Central Act, then, only a 
specific provision for such variation can be incorporated in such Central Acts. It will help in 
reducing the provisions of a Statute to minimum provisions and keep the Statutes Book and 
avoid repeated duplicity of provisions in the Central Acts. 
2. 	
The Committee has identified the following common provisions which can be 
included in the Common Provisions Act (to be enacted):— 
(i) Laying of rules made under any Act:— Every rule made under any Act shall 
be laid, as soon as may be after it is made, before each House of Parliament, while it 
is in session for a total period of thirty days which may be comprised in one session 
or in two or more successive sessions, and if, before the expiry of the session 
immediately following the session or the successive sessions aforesaid, both Houses 
agree in making any modification in the rule or both Houses agree that the rule 
should not be made, the rule shall thereafter have effect only in such modified form 
or be of no effect, as the case may be; so, however, that any such modification or 
annulment shall be without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done 
under that rule. 
(ii) Laying of Schemes:—Every scheme framed under any Act or made otherwise 
shall be laid, as soon as may be after it is framed or made, before each House of 
Parliament, while it is in session, for a total period of thirty days which may be 
comprised in one session or in two or more successive sessions, and if, before the 
expiry of the session immediately following the session or the successive sessions 
aforesaid, both houses agree in making any modification in the scheme, or both 
Houses agree that the scheme should not be framed, the scheme shall thereafter have 
effect only in such modified form or be of no effect, as the case may be; so, 
however, that any such modification or annulment shall be without prejudice to the 
validity of anything previously done under that scheme. 
(iii) Laying of Regulation made in respect of Public Sector Undertaking and 
Autonomous bodies:—Every regulation made under any Act shall be laid, as soon 
as may be after it is made, before each House of Parliament, while it is in session, 
for a total period of thirty days which may be comprised in one session or in two or 
619 
more successive sessions, and if, before the expiry of the session immediately 
following the session or the successive sessions aforesaid, both Houses agree in 
making any modification in the regulation or both Houses agree that the regulation 
should not be made, the regulation shall thereafter have effect only in such modified 
form or be of no effect, as the case may be; so, however, that any such modification 
or annulment shall be without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done 
under that regulation. 
(iv) Power to remove difficulties:— If any difficulty arises in giving effect to the 
provisions of an Act, the Central Government may, by order published in the 
Official Gazette, make such provisions not inconsistent with the provisions of that 
Act as appear to it to be necessary or expedient for removal of the difficulty: 
Provided that no such order shall be made after the expiry of a period of two 
years from the date of the commencement of that Act under which order shall be 
issued. 
Provided further that every order made under this section shall, as soon as may 
be after it is made, be laid before each House of Parliament. 
(v) Vacancy not to invalidate proceedings---No act or proceeding of any 
Corporations or Board or Authority shall be invalid merely on the ground of the 
existence of any vacancy in, or any defect in the composition of the Board or any 
vacancy in the body of trustees composing it or any vacancy or defect in the 
constitution of the Authority. 
(vi) Bar of Jurisdiction:— No court or other authority shall have, or be entitled to 
exercise, any jurisdiction, powers or authority (except the Supreme Court, and a 
High Court exercising jurisdiction under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution) in 
relation to the matters which falls under specific jurisdiction of any Authority, Board 
or Tribunals in terms of provisions of any Act making specific jurisdiction to any 
such Authority, Board or Tribunal.

and, subject to the other provisions of the Act and of any rules entrusted such 
functions, the Authorities, Tribunal and the Appellate Tribunal shall have powers to 
regulate their own procedure including the places at which they shall have their 
sittings. 
(B) The Tribunal and the Appellate Tribunal shall have, for the purposes of 
discharging their functions under this Act, the same powers as are vested in a civil 
court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), while trying a suit, in 
respect of the following matters, namely:-

(d) issuing corn-missions for the examination of witnesses or documents;

(h) any other matter which may be prescribed. 
(C) Any proceeding before the Authority, Tribunal or the Appellate Tribunal shall 
be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of sections 193 and 228, 
and for the purposes of section 196, of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) and the 
Tribunal or the Appellate Tribunal shall be deemed to be a civil court for all the 
purposes, of section 195 and Chapter XXVI of the Code of Criminal Procedure,

plates, countersignatures, authorisation, supply of statistics or copies of documents 
or orders or otherwise and for any other purpose or matter involving the rendering of 
any service by the officers or authorities under any Act or any rule made thereunder 
as may be considered necessary: 
Provided that the Central Government may, if it considers necessary so to do, in the 
public interest, by general or special order, exempt any class of persons from the 
payment of any such fee either in part or in full. 
(xi) Disqualification for holding office of the Central Government:—The 
Chairperson or any whole time member of a Tribunal, Authority or Board, unless the

India). 
3. The other provisions which are repeated can be included in consultation with the 
Legislative Department and Administrative Ministries.
